# ABSTRACT

In complex transfer learning scenarios new tasks might not be tightly linked to previous tasks. Approaches that transfer information contained only in the final parameters of a source model will therefore struggle. Instead, transfer learning at a higher level of abstraction is needed. We propose Leap, a framework that achieves this by transferring knowledge across learning processes. We associate each task with a manifold on which the training process travels from initialization to final parameters and construct a meta-learning objective that minimizes the expected length of this path. Our framework leverages only information obtained during training and can be computed on the fly at negligible cost. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods, both in meta-learning and transfer learning, on a set of computer vision tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that Leap can transfer knowledge across learning processes in demanding reinforcement learning environments (Atari) that involve millions of gradient steps.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Transfer learning is the process of transferring knowledge encoded in one model trained on one set of tasks to another model that is applied to a new task. Since a trained model encodes information in its learned parameters, transfer learning typically transfers knowledge by encouraging the target model's parameters to resemble those of a previous (set of) model(s) (Pan & Yang, 2009). This approach limits transfer learning to settings where good parameters for a new task can be found in the neighborhood of parameters that were learned from a previous task. For this to be a viable assumption, the two tasks must have a high degree of structural affinity, such as when a new task can be learned by extracting features from a pretrained model (Girshick et al., 2014; He et al., 2017; Mahajan et al., 2018). If not, this approach has been observed to limit knowledge transfer since the training process on one task will discard information that was irrelevant for the task at hand, but that would be relevant for another task (Higgins et al., 2017; Achille et al., 2018).

We argue that such information can be harnessed, even when the downstream task is unknown, by transferring knowledge of the learning process itself. In particular, we propose a meta-learning framework for aggregating information across task geometries as they are observed during training. These geometries, formalized as the loss surface, encode all information seen during training and thus avoid catastrophic information loss. Moreover, by transferring knowledge across learning processes, information from previous tasks is distilled to explicitly facilitate the learning of new tasks.

Meta learning frames the learning of a new task as a learning problem itself, typically in the few-shot learning paradigm (Lake et al., 2011; Santoro et al., 2016; Vinyals et al., 2016). In this

environment, learning is a problem of rapid adaptation and can be solved by training a meta-learner by backpropagating through the entire training process (Ravi & Larochelle, 2016; Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2017). For more demanding tasks, meta-learning in this manner is challenging; backpropagating through thousands of gradient steps is both impractical and susceptible to instability. On the other hand, truncating backpropagation to a few initial steps induces a short-horizon bias (Wu et al., 2018). We argue that as the training process grows longer in terms of the distance traversed on the loss landscape, the geometry of this landscape grows increasingly important. When adapting to a new task through a single or a handful of gradient steps, the geometry can largely be ignored. In contrast, with more gradient steps, it is the dominant feature of the training process.

To scale meta-learning beyond few-shot learning, we propose Leap, a light-weight framework for meta-learning over task manifolds that does not need any forward- or backward-passes beyond those already performed by the underlying training process. We demonstrate empirically that Leap is a superior method to similar meta and transfer learning methods when learning a task requires more than a handful of training steps. Finally, we evaluate Leap in a reinforcement Learning environment (Atari 2000; Bellemare et al., 2013), demonstrating that it can transfer knowledge across learning processes that require millions of gradient steps to converge.

# 2 TRANSFERRING KNOWLEDGE ACROSS LEARNING PROCESSES

We start in section 2.1 by introducing the gradient descent algorithm from a geometric perspective. Section 2.2 builds a framework for transfer learning and explains how we can leverage geometrical quantities to transfer knowledge across learning processes by guiding gradient descent. We focus on the point of initialization for simplicity, but our framework can readily be extended. Section 2.3 presents Leap, our lightweight algorithm for transfer learning across learning processes.

# 2.1 GRADIENT PATHS ON TASK MANIFOLDS

Central to our framework is the notion of a learning process; the harder a task is to learn, the harder it is for the learning process to navigate on the loss surface (fig. 1). Our framework is based on the idea that transfer learning can be achieved by leveraging information contained in similar learning processes. Exploiting that this information is encoded in the geometry of the loss surface, we leverage geometrical quantities to facilitate the learning process with respect to new tasks. We focus on the supervised learning setting for simplicity, though our framework applies more generally. Given a learning objective  $f$  that consumes an input  $x \in \mathbb{R}^m$  and a target  $y \in \mathbb{R}^c$  and maps a parameterization  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^n$  to a scalar loss value, we have the gradient descent update as

$$
\theta^ {i + 1} = \theta^ {i} - \alpha^ {i} S ^ {i} \nabla f (\theta^ {i}), \tag {1}
$$

where  $\nabla f(\theta^i) = \mathbb{E}_{x,y\sim p(x,y)}\left[\nabla f(\theta^i,x,y)\right]$ . We take the learning rate schedule  $\{\alpha^i\}_i$  and preconditioning matrices  $\{S^i\}_i$  as given, but our framework can be extended to learn these jointly with the initialization. Different schemes represent different optimizers; for instance  $\alpha^i = \alpha$ ,  $S^i = I_n$  yields gradient descent, while defining  $S^i$  as the inverse Fisher matrix results in natural gradient descent (Amari, 1998). We assume this process converges to a stationary point after  $K$  gradient steps.

To distinguish different learning processes originating from the same initialization, we need a notion of their length. The longer the process, the worse the initialization is (conditional on reaching equivalent performance, discussed further below). Measuring the Euclidean distance between initialization and final parameters is misleading as it ignores the actual path taken. This becomes crucial when we compare paths from different tasks, as gradient paths from different tasks can originate from the same initialization and converge to similar final parameters, but take very different paths. Therefore, to capture the length of a learning process we must associate it with the loss surface it traversed.

The process of learning a task can be seen as a curve on a specific task manifold  $M$ . While this manifold can be constructed in a variety of ways, here we exploit that, by definition, any learning process traverses the loss surface of  $f$ . As such, to accurately describe the length of a gradient-based learning process, it is sufficient to define the task manifold as the loss surface. In particular, because the learning process in eq. 1 follows the gradient trajectory, it constantly provides information about the

geometry of the loss surface. Gradients that largely point in the same direction indicate a well-behaved loss surface, whereas gradients with frequently opposing directions indicate an ill-conditioned loss surface—something we would like to avoid. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework for transfer learning that exploits the accumulation of geometric information by constructing a meta objective that minimizes the expected length of the gradient descent path across tasks. In doing so, the meta objective intrinsically balances local geometries across tasks and encourages an initialization that makes the learning process as short as possible.

To formalize the notion of the distance of a learning process, we define a task manifold  $M$  as a submanifold of  $\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$  given by the graph of  $f$ . Every point  $p = (\theta ,f(\theta))\in M$  is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean subspace, described by the tangent space  $T_{p}M$ . Taking  $\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$  to be Euclidean, it is a Riemann manifold. By virtue of being a submanifold of  $\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$ ,  $M$  is also a Riemann manifold. As such,  $M$  comes equipped with an smoothly varying inner product  $g_{p}:T_{p}M\times T_{p}M\mapsto \mathbb{R}$  on tangent spaces, allowing us to measure the length of a path on  $M$ . In particular, the length (or energy) of any curve  $\gamma :[0,1]\mapsto M$  is defined by accumulating infinitesimal changes along the trajectory,

$$
\operatorname {L e n g t h} (\gamma) = \int_ {0} ^ {1} \sqrt {g _ {\gamma (t)} (\dot {\gamma} (t) , \dot {\gamma} (t))} d t, \quad \operatorname {E n e r g y} (\gamma) = \int_ {0} ^ {1} g _ {\gamma (t)} (\dot {\gamma} (t), \dot {\gamma} (t)) d t, \tag {2}
$$

where  $\dot{\gamma}(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\gamma(t) \in T_{\gamma(t)}M$  is a tangent vector of  $\gamma(t) = (\theta(t), f(\theta(t))) \in M$ . We use parentheses (i.e.  $\gamma(t)$ ) to differentiate discrete and continuous domains. With  $M$  being a submanifold of  $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ , the induced metric on  $M$  is defined by  $g_{\gamma(t)}(\dot{\gamma}(t), \dot{\gamma}(t)) = \langle \dot{\gamma}(t), \dot{\gamma}(t) \rangle$ . Different constructions of  $M$  yield different Riemann metrics. In particular, if the model underlying  $f$  admits a predictive probability distribution  $P(y \mid x)$ , the task manifold can be given an information geometric interpretation by choosing the Fisher matrix as Riemann metric, in which case the task manifold is defined over the space of probability distributions (Amari & Nagaoka, 2007). If eq. 1 is defined as natural gradient descent, the learning process corresponds to gradient descent on this manifold (Amari, 1998; Martens, 2010; Pascanu & Bengio, 2014; Luk & Grosse, 2018).

Having a complete description of a task manifold, we can measure the length of a learning process by noting that gradient descent can be seen as a discrete approximation to the scaled gradient flow  $\dot{\theta}(t) = -S(t)\nabla f(\theta(t))$ . This flow describes a curve that originates in  $\gamma(0) = (\theta^0, f(\theta^0))$  and follows the gradient at each point. Going forward, we define  $\gamma$  to be this unique curve and refer to it as the gradient path from  $\theta^0$  on  $M$ . The metrics in eq. 2 can be computed exactly, but in practice we observe a discrete learning process. Analogously to how the gradient update rule approximates the gradient flow, the gradient path length or energy can be approximated by the cumulative chordal distance (Ahlberg et al., 1967),

$$
d _ {p} \left(\theta^ {0}, M\right) = \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {K - 1} \| \gamma^ {i + 1} - \gamma^ {i} \| _ {2} ^ {p}, \quad p \in \{1, 2 \}. \tag {3}
$$

Figure 2: Left: illustration of Leap (algorithm 1) for two tasks,  $\tau$  and  $\tau'$ . From an initialization  $\theta^0$ , the learning process of each task generates gradient paths,  $\Psi_{\tau}$  and  $\Psi_{\tau'}$ , which Leap uses to minimize the expected path length. Iterating the process, Leap converges to a locally Pareto optimal initialization. Right: the pull-forward objective (eq. 6) used to minimize the expected gradient path length. Any gradient path  $\Psi_{\tau} = \{\psi_{\tau}^{i}\}_{i=1}^{K_{\tau}}$  acts on  $\theta^0$  by pulling each  $\theta_{\tau}^{i}$  towards  $\psi_{\tau}^{i+1}$ .

We write  $d$  when the distinction between the length or energy metric is immaterial. Using the energy yields a slightly simpler objective, but the length normalizes each length segment and as such protects against differences in scale between task objectives. In appendix C, we conduct an ablation study and find that they perform similarly, though using the length leads to faster convergence. Importantly,  $d$  involves only terms seen during task training. We exploit this later when we construct the meta gradient, enabling us to perform gradient descent on the meta objective at negligible cost (eq. 8).

We now turn to the transfer learning setting where we face a set of tasks, each with a distinct task manifold. Our framework is built on the idea that we can transfer knowledge across learning processes via the local geometry by aggregating information obtained along observed gradient paths. As such, Leap finds an initialization from which learning converges as rapidly as possible in expectation.

# 2.2 META LEARNING ACROSS TASK MANIFOLDS

Formally, we define a task  $\tau = (f_{\tau}, p_{\tau}, u_{\tau})$  as the process of learning to approximate the relationship  $x \mapsto y$  through samples from the data distribution  $p_{\tau}(x, y)$ . This process is defined by the gradient update rule  $u_{\tau}$  (as defined in eq. 1), applied  $K_{\tau}$  times to minimize the task objective  $f_{\tau}$ . Thus, a learning process starts at  $\theta_{\tau}^{0} = \theta^{0}$  and progresses via  $\theta_{\tau}^{i+1} = u_{\tau}(\theta_{\tau}^{i})$  until  $\theta_{\tau}^{K_{\tau}}$  is obtained. The sequence  $\{\theta_{\tau}^{i}\}_{i=0}^{K_{\tau}}$  defines an approximate gradient path on the task manifold  $M_{\tau}$  with distance  $d(\theta^{0}; M_{\tau})$ .

To understand how  $d$  transfers knowledge across learning processes, consider two distinct tasks. We can transfer knowledge across these tasks' learning processes by measuring how good a shared initialization is. Assuming two candidate initializations converge to limit points with equivalent performance on each task, the initialization with shortest expected gradient path distance encodes more knowledge sharing. In particular, if both tasks have convex loss surfaces a unique optimal initialization exists that achieves Pareto optimality in terms of total path distance. This can be crucial in data sparse regimes: rapid convergence may be the difference between learning a task and failing due to overfitting (Finn et al., 2017).

Given a distribution of tasks  $p(\tau)$ , each candidate initialization  $\theta^0$  is associated with a measure of its expected gradient path distance,  $\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim p(\tau)}[d(\theta^0; M_\tau)]$ , that summarizes the suitability of the initialization to the task distribution. The initialization (or a set thereof) with shortest expected gradient path distance maximally transfers knowledge across learning processes and is Pareto optimal in this regard. Above, we have assumed that all candidate initializations converge to limit points of equal performance. If the task objective  $f_\tau$  is non-convex this is not a trivial assumption and the gradient path distance itself does not differentiate between different levels of final performance.

As such, it is necessary to introduce a feasibility constraint to ensure only initializations with some minimum level of performance are considered. We leverage that transfer learning never happens in a vacuum; we always have a second-best option, such as starting from a random initialization or a pretrained model. This "second-best" initialization,  $\psi^0$ , provides us with the performance we

would obtain on a given task in the absence of knowledge transfer. As such, performance obtained by initializing from  $\psi^0$  provides us with an upper bound for each task: a candidate solution  $\theta^0$  must achieve at least as good performance to be a viable solution. Formally, this implies the task-specific requirement that a candidate  $\theta^0$  must satisfy  $f_{\tau}(\theta_{\tau}^{K_{\tau}}) \leq f_{\tau}(\psi_{\tau}^{K_{\tau}})$ . As this must hold for every task, we obtain the canonical meta objective

$$
\min  _ {\theta^ {0}} F (\theta^ {0}) = \mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim p (\tau)} \left[ d (\theta^ {0}; M _ {\tau}) \right]
$$

$$
\text {s . t .} \quad \theta_ {\tau} ^ {i + 1} = u _ {\tau} \left(\theta_ {\tau} ^ {i}\right), \quad \theta_ {\tau} ^ {0} = \theta^ {0}, \tag {4}
$$

$$
\theta^ {0} \in \Theta = \cap_ {\tau} \left\{\theta^ {0} \mid f _ {\tau} \left(\theta_ {\tau} ^ {K _ {\tau}}\right) \leq f _ {\tau} \left(\psi_ {\tau} ^ {K _ {\tau}}\right) \right\}.
$$

This meta objective is robust to variations in the geometry of loss surfaces, as it balances complementary and competing learning processes (fig. 2). For instance, there may be an initialization that can solve a small subset of tasks in a handful of gradient steps, but would be catastrophic for other related tasks. When transferring knowledge via the initialization, we must trade off commonalities and differences between gradient paths. In eq. 4 these trade-offs arise naturally. For instance, as the number of tasks whose gradient paths move in the same direction increases, so does their pull on the initialization. Conversely, as the updates to the initialization renders some gradient paths longer, these act as springs that exert increasingly strong pressure on the initialization. The solution to eq. 4 thus achieves an equilibrium between these competing forces.

Solving eq. 4 naively requires training to convergence on each task to determine whether an initialization satisfies the feasibility constraint, which can be very costly. Fortunately, because we have access to a second-best initialization, we can solve eq. 4 more efficiently by obtaining gradient paths from  $\psi^0$  and use these as baselines that we incrementally improve upon. This improved initialization converges to the same limit points, but with shorter expected gradient paths (theorem 1). As such, it becomes the new second-best option; Leap (algorithm 1) repeats this process of improving upon increasingly demanding baselines, ultimately finding a solution to the canonical meta objective.

# 2.3 LEAP

Leap starts from a given second-best initialization  $\psi^0$ , shared across all tasks, and constructs baseline gradient paths  $\Psi_{\tau} = \{\psi_{\tau}^{i}\}_{i=0}^{K_{\tau}}$  for each task  $\tau$  in a batch  $\mathcal{B}$ . These provide a set of baselines  $\Psi = \{\Psi_{\tau}\}_{\tau \in \mathcal{B}}$ . Recall that all tasks share the same initialization,  $\psi_{\tau}^{0} = \psi^{0} \in \Theta$ . We use these baselines, corresponding to task-specific learning processes, to modify the gradient path distance metric in eq. 3 by freezing the forward point  $\gamma_{\tau}^{i+1}$  in all norms,

$$
\bar {d} _ {p} \left(\theta^ {0}; M _ {\tau}, \Psi_ {\tau}\right) = \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {K _ {\tau} - 1} \| \bar {\gamma} _ {\tau} ^ {i + 1} - \gamma_ {\tau} ^ {i} \| _ {2} ^ {p}, \tag {5}
$$

where  $\bar{\gamma}_{\tau}^{i} = (\psi_{\tau}^{i},f(\psi_{\tau}^{i}))$  represents the frozen forward point from the baseline and  $\gamma_{\tau}^{i} = (\theta_{\tau}^{i},f(\theta_{\tau}^{i}))$  the point on the gradient path originating from  $\theta^0$ . This surrogate distance metric encodes the feasibility constraint; optimizing  $\bar{\theta}^0$  with respect to  $\Psi$  pulls the initialization forward along each task-specific gradient path in an unconstrained variant of eq. 4 that replaces  $\Theta$  with  $\Psi$ ,

$$
\min  _ {\theta^ {0}} \bar {F} \left(\theta^ {0}; \Psi\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim p (\tau)} \left[ \bar {d} \left(\theta^ {0}; M _ {\tau}, \Psi_ {\tau}\right) \right], \tag {6}
$$

$$
\text {s . t .} \qquad \theta_ {\tau} ^ {i + 1} = u _ {\tau} (\theta_ {\tau} ^ {i}), \quad \theta_ {\tau} ^ {0} = \theta^ {0}.
$$

We refer to eq. 6 as the pull-forward objective. incrementally improving  $\theta^0$  over  $\psi^0$  leads to a new second-best option that Leap uses to generate a new set of more demanding baselines, to further improve the initialization. Iterating this process, Leap produces a sequence of candidate solutions to eq. 4, all in  $\Theta$ , with incrementally shorter gradient paths. While the pull-forward objective can be solved with any optimization algorithm, we consider gradient-based methods. In theorem 1, we show that gradient descent on  $\bar{F}$  yields solutions that always lie in  $\Theta$ . In principle,  $\bar{F}$  can be evaluated at any  $\theta^0$ , but a more efficient strategy is to evaluate  $\theta^0$  at  $\psi^0$ . In this case,  $\bar{d} = d$ , so that  $\bar{F} = F$ .

Theorem 1 (Pull-forward). Define a sequence of initializations  $\{\theta_s^0\}_{s\in \mathbb{N}}$  by

$$
\theta_ {s + 1} ^ {0} = \theta_ {s} ^ {0} - \beta_ {s} \nabla \bar {F} \left(\theta_ {s} ^ {0}; \Psi_ {s}\right), \quad \theta^ {0} \in \Theta , \tag {7}
$$

with  $\psi_s^0 = \theta_s^0$  for all  $s$ . For  $\beta_{s} > 0$  sufficiently small, there exist learning rates schedules  $\{\alpha_{\tau}^{i}\}_{i = 1}^{K_{\tau}}$  for all tasks such that  $\theta_{k\to \infty}^{0}$  is a limit point in  $\Theta$ .

Proof: see appendix A. Because the meta gradient requires differentiating the learning process, we must adopt an approximation. In doing so, we obtain a meta-gradient that can be computed analytically on the fly during task training. Differentiating  $\bar{F}$ , we have

$$
\nabla \bar {F} \left(\theta^ {0}, \Psi\right) = - p \mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim p (\tau)} \left[ \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {K _ {\tau} - 1} J _ {\tau} ^ {i} \left(\theta_ {\tau} ^ {0}\right) ^ {T} \left(\Delta f _ {\tau} ^ {i} \nabla f _ {\tau} \left(\theta_ {\tau} ^ {i}\right) + \Delta \theta_ {\tau} ^ {i}\right) \left(\left\| \bar {\gamma} _ {\tau} ^ {i + 1} - \gamma_ {\tau} ^ {i} \right\| _ {2} ^ {p}\right) ^ {p - 2} \right] \tag {8}
$$

where  $J_{\tau}^{i}$  denotes the Jacobian of  $\theta_{\tau}^{i}$  with respect to the initialization,  $\Delta f_{\tau}^{i} = f_{\tau}(\psi_{\tau}^{i + 1}) - f_{\tau}(\theta_{\tau}^{i})$  and  $\Delta \theta_{\tau}^{i} = \psi_{\tau}^{i + 1} - \theta_{\tau}^{i}$ . To render the meta gradient tractable, we need to approximate the Jacobians, as these are costly to compute. Empirical evidence suggests that they are largely redundant (Finn et al., 2017; Nichol et al., 2018). Nichol et al. (2018) further shows that an identity approximation yields a meta-gradient that remains faithful to the original meta objective. We provide some further support for this approximation (see appendix B). First, we note that the learning rate directly controls the quality of the approximation; for any  $K_{\tau}$ , the identity approximation can be made arbitrarily accurate by choosing a sufficiently small learning rates. We conduct an ablation study to ascertain how severe this limitation is and find that it is relatively loose. For the best-performing learning rate, the identity approximation is accurate to four decimal places and shows no signs of significant deterioration as the number of training steps increases. As such, we assume  $J^{i}\approx I_{n}$  throughout. Finally, by evaluating  $\nabla \bar{F}$  at  $\theta^0 = \psi^0$ , the meta gradient contains only terms seen during standard training and can be computed asynchronously on the fly at negligible cost.

In practice, we use stochastic gradient descent during task training. This injects noise in  $f$  as well as in its gradient, resulting in a noisy gradient path. Noise in the gradient path does not prevent Leap from converging. However, noise reduces the rate of convergence, in particular when a noisy gradient step results in  $f_{\tau}(\psi_{\tau}^{s + 1}) - f_{\tau}(\theta_{\tau}^{i}) > 0$ . If the gradient estimator is reasonably accurate, this causes the term  $\Delta f_{\tau}^{i}\nabla f_{\tau}(\theta_{\tau}^{i})$  in eq. 8 to point in the steepest ascent direction. We found that adding a stabilizer to ensure we always follow the descent direction significantly speeds up convergence and allows us to use larger learning rates. In this paper, we augment  $\bar{F}$  with a stabilizer of the form

$$
\mu \left(f _ {\tau} (\theta_ {\tau} ^ {i}); f _ {\tau} (\psi_ {\tau} ^ {i + 1})\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 0 & \text {i f} \quad f _ {\tau} (\psi_ {\tau} ^ {i + 1}) \leq f _ {\tau} (\theta_ {\tau} ^ {i}), \\ - 2 (f _ {\tau} (\psi_ {\tau} ^ {i + 1}) - f _ {\tau} (\theta_ {\tau} ^ {i})) ^ {2} & \text {e l s e}. \end{array} \right.
$$

Adding  $\nabla \mu$  (re-scaled if necessary) to the meta-gradient is equivalent to replacing  $\Delta f_{\tau}^{i}$  with  $-|\Delta f_{\tau}^{i}|$  in eq. 8. This ensures that we never follow  $\nabla f_{\tau}(\theta_{\tau}^{i})$  in the ascent direction, instead reinforcing the descent direction at that point. This stabilizer is a heuristic, there are many others that could prove helpful. In appendix C we perform an ablation study and find that the stabilizer is not necessary for Leap to converge, but it does speed up convergence significantly.

# 3 RELATED WORK

Transfer learning has been explored in a variety of settings, the most typical approach attempting to infuse knowledge in a target model's parameters by encouraging them to lie close to those of a pretrained source model (Pan & Yang, 2009). Because such approaches can limit knowledge transfer (Higgins et al., 2017; Achille et al., 2018), applying standard transfer learning techniques leads to catastrophic forgetting, by which the model is rendered unable to perform a previously mastered task (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; Goodfellow et al., 2013). These problems are further accentuated when there is a larger degree of diversity among tasks that push optimal parameterizations further apart. In these cases, transfer learning can in fact be worse than training from scratch.

Recent approaches extend standard finetuning by adding regularizing terms to the training objective that encourage the model to learn parameters that both solve a new task and retain high performance on previous tasks. These regularizers operate by protecting the parameters that affect the loss function the most (Miconi et al., 2018; Zenke et al., 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Serra et al., 2018). Because these approaches use a single model to encode both global task-general information and local task-specific information, they can over-regularize, preventing the model from learning further tasks. More importantly, Schwarz et al. (2018) found that while these approaches mitigate catastrophic forgetting, they are unable to facilitate knowledge transfer on the benchmark they considered. Ultimately, if a single model must encode both task-generic and task-specific information, it must either saturate or grow in size (Rusu et al., 2016).

In contrast, meta-learning aims to learn the learning process itself (Schmidhuber, 1987; Bengio et al., 1991; Santoro et al., 2016; Ravi & Larochelle, 2016; Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Vinyals et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2017). The literature focuses primarily on few-shot learning, where a task is some variation on a common theme, such as subsets of classes drawn from a shared pool of data (Lake et al., 2015; Vinyals et al., 2016). The meta-learning algorithm adapts a model to a new task given a handful of samples. Recent attention has been devoted to three main approaches. One trains the meta-learner to adapt to a new task by comparing an input to samples from previous tasks (Vinyals et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2018; Snell et al., 2017). More relevant to our framework are approaches that parameterize the training process through a recurrent neural network that takes the gradient as input and produces a new set of parameters (Ravi & Larochelle, 2016; Santoro et al., 2016; Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Hochreiter et al., 2001). The approach most closely related to us learns an initialization such that the model can adapt to a new task through one or a few gradient updates (Finn et al., 2017; Nichol et al., 2018; Al-Shedivat et al., 2017; Lee & Choi, 2018). In contrast to our work, these methods focus exclusively on few-shot learning, where the gradient path is trivial as only a single or a handful of training steps are allowed, limiting them to settings where the current task is closely related to previous ones.

It is worth noting that the Model Agnostic Meta Learner (MAML: Finn et al., 2017) can be written as  $\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim p(\tau)}\left[f_{\tau}(\theta_{\tau}^{K})\right]$ . As such, it arises as a special case of Leap where only the final parameterization is evaluated in terms of its final performance. Similarly, the Reptile algorithm (Nichol et al., 2018), which proposes to update rule  $\theta^0 \gets \theta^0 + \epsilon \left(\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim p(\tau)}\left[\theta_{\tau}^{K}\right] - \theta^0\right)$ , can be seen as a naive version of Leap that assumes all task geometries are Euclidean. In particular, Leap reduces to Reptile if  $f_{\tau}$  is removed from the task manifold and the energy metric without stabilizer is used. We find this configuration to perform significantly worse than any other (see section 4.1 and appendix C).

Related work studying models from a geometric perspective have explored how to interpolate in a generative model's learned latent space (Tosi et al., 2014; Shao et al., 2017; Arvanitidis et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2017). Riemann manifolds have also garnered attention in the context of optimization, as a preconditioning matrix can be understood as the instantiation of some Riemann metric (Amari & Nagaoka, 2007; Abbati et al., 2018; Luk & Grosse, 2018).

# 4 EMPIRICAL RESULTS

We consider three experiments with increasingly complex knowledge transfer. We measure transfer learning in terms of final performance and speed of convergence, where the latter is defined as the area under the training error curve. We compare Leap to competing meta-learning methods on the Omniglot dataset by transferring knowledge across alphabets (section 4.1). We study Leap's ability to transfer knowledge over more complex and diverse tasks in a Multi-CV experiment (section 4.2) and finally evaluate Leap on in a demanding reinforcement environment (section 4.3).

# 4.1 OMNIGLOT

The Omniglot (Lake et al., 2015) dataset consists of 50 alphabets, which we define to be distinct tasks. We hold 10 alphabets out for final evaluation and use subsets of the remaining alphabets for meta-learning or pretraining. We vary the number of alphabets used for meta-learning / pretraining from 1 to 25 and compare final performance and rate of convergence on held-out tasks. We compare against no pretraining, multi-headed finetuning, MAML, the first-order approximation of MAML (FOMAML; Finn et al., 2017), and Reptile. We train on a given task for 100 steps, with the exception of MAML where we backpropagate through 5 training steps during meta-training. For Leap, we report performance under the length metric  $(d_1)$ ; see appendix C for an ablation study on Leap hyper-parameters. For further details, see appendix D.

Any type of knowledge transfer significantly improves upon a random initialization. MAML exhibits a considerable short-horizon bias (Wu et al., 2018). While FOMAML is trained full trajectories, but because it only leverages gradient information at final iteration, which may be arbitrarily uninformative, it does worse. Multi-headed finetuning is a tough benchmark to beat as tasks are very similar. Nevertheless, for sufficiently rich task distributions, both Reptile and Leap outperform finetuning, with Leap outperforming Reptile as the complexity grows. Notably, the AUC gap between Reptile and Leap grows in the number of training steps (fig. 3), amounting to a 4 percentage point difference in final validation error (table 2). Overall, the relative performance of meta-learners underscores the importance of leveraging geometric information in meta-learning.

# 4.2 MULTI-CV

Inspired by Serrà et al. (2018), we consider a set of computer vision datasets as distinct tasks. We pretrain on all but one task, which is held out for final evaluation. For details, see appendix E. To reduce the computational burden during meta training, we pretrain on each task in the meta batch for one epoch using the energy metric  $(d_2)$ . We found this to reach equivalent performance to training on longer gradient paths or using the length metric. This indicates that it is sufficient for Leap to see a partial trajectory to correctly infer shared structures across task geometries.

We compare Leap against a random initialization, multi-headed finetuning, a non-sequential version of HAT (Serrà et al., 2018) (i.e. allowing revisits) and a non-sequential version of Progressive Nets (Rusu et al., 2016), where we allow lateral connection between every task. Note that this makes Progressive Nets over 8 times larger in terms of learnable parameters.

The Multi-CV experiment is more challenging both due to greater task diversity and greater complexity among tasks. We report results on held-out tasks in table 1. Leap outperforms all baselines on all but one transfer learning tasks (Facescrub), where Progressive Nets does marginally better than a random initialization owing to its increased parameter count. Notably, while Leap does marginally worse than a random initialization, finetuning and HAT leads to a substantial drop in performance. On all other tasks, Leap converges faster to optimal performance and achieves superior final performance.

# 4.3 ATARI

To demonstrate that Leap can scale to large problems, both in computational terms and in task complexity, we apply it in a reinforcement learning environment, specifically Atari 2600 games (Bellemare et al., 2013). We use an actor-critic architecture (Sutton et al., 1998) with the policy and the value function sharing a convolutional encoder. We apply Leap with respect to the encoder using the energy metric  $(d_2)$ . During meta training, we sample mini-batches from 27 games that have an action space dimensionality of at most 10, holding out two games with similar action space dimensionality for evaluation, as well as games with larger action spaces (table 6). During meta-training, we train on each task for five million training steps. See appendix F for details.

We train for 100 meta training steps, which is sufficient to see a distinct improvement; we expect a longer meta-training phase to yield further gains. We find that Leap generally outperforms a random initialization. This performance gain is primarily driven by less volatile exploration, as seen by the confidence intervals in fig. 4 (see also fig. 8). Leap finds a useful exploration space faster and more consistently, demonstrating that Leap can find shared structures across a diverse set of complex learning processes. We note that these gains may not cater equally to all tasks. In the case of WizardOfWor (part of the meta-training set), Leap exhibits two modes: in one it performs on par with the baseline, in the other exploration is protracted (fig. 8). This phenomena stems from randomness in the learning process, which renders an observed gradient path relatively less representative. Such randomness can be marginalized by training for longer.

That Leap can outperform a random initialization on the pretraining set (AirRaid, UpNDown) is perhaps not surprising. More striking is that it exhibits the same behavior on out-of-distribution tasks. In particular, Alien, Gravitar and RoadRunner all have at least  $50\%$  larger state space than anything encountered during pretraining (appendix F, table 6), yet Leap outperforms a random initialization. This suggests that transferring knowledge at a higher level of abstraction, such as in the space of gradient paths, generalizes to unseen task variations as long as underlying learning dynamics agree.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

Transfer learning typically ignores the learning process itself, restricting knowledge transfer to scenarios where target tasks are very similar to source tasks. In this paper, we present Leap, a framework for knowledge transfer at a higher level of abstraction. By formalizing knowledge transfer as minimizing the expected length of gradient paths, we propose a method for meta-learning that scales to highly demanding problems. We find empirically that Leap has superior generalizing properties to finetuning and competing meta-learners.
