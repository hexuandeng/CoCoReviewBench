In this "stateless" didactic example, the simple quadratic objective has the global optimum at the origin (details in Section 3.1). PPO shrinks the exploration variance prematurely, which leads to slow convergence. PPO-CMA dynamically expands the variance to speed up progress, and only shrinks the variance when close to the optimum.

# ABSTRACT

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a highly popular model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach. However, in continuous state and actions spaces and a Gaussian policy – common in computer animation and robotics – PPO is prone to getting stuck in local optima. In this paper, we observe a tendency of PPO to prematurely shrink the exploration variance, which naturally leads to slow progress. Motivated by this, we borrow ideas from CMA-ES, a black-box optimization method designed for intelligent adaptive Gaussian exploration, to derive PPO-CMA, a novel proximal policy optimization approach that can expand the exploration variance on objective function slopes and shrink the variance when close to the optimum. This is implemented by using separate neural networks for policy mean and variance and training the mean and variance in separate passes. Our experiments demonstrate a clear improvement over vanilla PPO in many difficult OpenAI Gym MuJoCo tasks.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

This paper proposes a new solution to the problem of policy optimization with high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. This is a problem that has a long history in computer animation, robotics, and machine learning research. More specifically, our work falls in the domain of simulation-based Monte Carlo approaches; instead of operating with closed-form expressions of the control dynamics, we use a black-box dynamics simulator, sample actions from some distribution, simulate the results, and then adapt the sampling distribution. In recent years, such approaches have achieved remarkable success in previously intractable tasks such as real-time locomotion control of (simplified) biomechanical models of the human body (Wang et al. (2010); Geijtenbeek et al. (2013); Hämäläinen et al. (2014; 2015); Liu et al. (2016); Duan et al. (2016); Rajamäki & Hämäläinen (2017)). In 2017, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) provided the first demonstration of a neural

network policy that enables a simulated humanoid not only to run but also to rapidly switch direction and get up after falling (Schulman et al. (2017)). Previously, such feats had only been achieved with more computationally heavy approaches that used simulation and sampling not only during training but also in run-time (Hämäläinen et al. (2014; 2015); Rajamäki & Hämäläinen (2017)).

PPO has been quickly adopted as the default RL algorithm in popular frameworks like Unity Machine Learning Agents<sup>1</sup> and TensorFlow Agents (Hafner et al. (2017)). It has also been extended and applied to even more complex humanoid movement skills such as kung-fu kicks and backflips (Peng et al. (2018)). Outside the continuous control domain, it has demonstrated outstanding performance in complex multi-agent video games<sup>2</sup>. However, like many other reinforcement learning methods, PPO can be sensitive to hyperparameter choices and difficult to tune (Henderson et al. (2017)). In experiments by ourselves and our colleagues, we have also noticed a tendency to get stuck in local optima.

In this paper, we make the following contributions:

- We provide visualizations and evidence of how PPO's exploration variance can shrink prematurely, which leads to slow progress or getting stuck in local optima. Figure 1 illustrates this in a simple didactic example. Subsequently, we discuss how a similar exploration problem is solved in the black-box optimization domain by Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). CMA-ES dynamically expands the exploration variance on objective function slopes and only shrinks the variance when close to the optimum.  
- We show how exploration behavior similar to CMA-ES can be achieved in RL with simple changes, resulting in our PPO-CMA algorithm visualized in Figure 1. As elaborated in Section 4, a key idea of PPO-CMA is to use separate neural networks for policy mean and variance, and train the mean and variance in separate passes. Our experiments show a significant improvement over PPO in many OpenAI Gym MuJoCo tasks (Brockman et al. (2016)).

In Appendix A, we also investigate solving the variance adaptation problem with simple variance clipping and entropy regularization. The entropy regularization was suggested by Schulman et al. (2017) but not analyzed in detail. Our results suggest that both approaches can help but they are sensitive to tuning parameters.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

7: end for

We consider the discounted formulation of the policy optimization problem, following the notation of Schulman et al. (2015b). At time  $t$ , the agent observes a state vector  $\mathbf{s}_t$  and takes an action  $\mathbf{a}_t \sim \pi_\theta(\mathbf{a}_t|\mathbf{s}_t)$ , where  $\pi_\theta$  denotes a stochastic policy parameterized by  $\theta$ , e.g., neural network weights. This results in observing a new state  $\mathbf{s}_t'$  and receiving a scalar reward  $r_t$ . The goal is to find  $\theta$  that maximizes the expected future-discounted sum of rewards  $\mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t]$ , where  $\gamma$  is a discount factor in the range  $(0, 1)$ . A lower  $\gamma$  makes the learning prefer instant gratification instead of long-term gains.

The original PPO and the PPO-CMA proposed in this paper collect experience tuples  $[\mathbf{s}_i, \mathbf{a}_i, r_i, \mathbf{s}_i^{\prime}]$  by simulating a number of episodes in each optimization iteration. For each episode, an initial state  $\mathbf{s}_0$  is sampled from some application-dependent stationary distribution, and the simulation is continued until a terminal (absorbing) state or a predefined maximum episode length  $T$  is reached. After an iteration simulation budget  $N$  is exhausted,  $\theta$  is updated. This is summarized in Algorithm 1.

# 2.2 POLICY GRADIENT WITH ADVANTAGE ESTIMATION

Policy gradient methods update policy parameters by estimating the gradient  $\mathbf{g} = \nabla_{\theta}\mathbb{E}[\sum_t^\infty \gamma^t r_t]$ . There are different formulations of the gradient, of which PPO uses the following:

$$
\mathbf {g} = \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} A ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t}, \mathbf {a} _ {t}\right) \nabla_ {\theta} \log \pi_ {\theta} \left(\mathbf {a} _ {t} \mid \mathbf {s} _ {t}\right) \right], \tag {1}
$$

where  $A^{\pi}$  is the so-called advantage function.

Intuitively, the advantage function is positive if an explored action yields better rewards than expected. Updating  $\theta$  in the direction of  $\mathbf{g}$  makes negative advantage actions less likely and positive advantage actions more likely (Schulman et al. (2015b)). In practice, using modern compute graph frameworks like TensorFlow (Abadi et al. (2016)), one often does not directly operate on the gradients, but instead uses an optimizer like Adam (Kingma & Ba (2014)) to minimize the corresponding loss

$$
\mathcal {L} = - \frac {1}{M} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} A ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {i}, \mathbf {a} _ {i}\right) \log \pi_ {\theta} \left(\mathbf {a} _ {i} \mid \mathbf {s} _ {i}\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $i$  denotes minibatch sample index and  $M$  is minibatch size. In summary, this type of policy gradient RL simply requires a differentiable expression of  $\pi_{\theta}$  and a way to measure  $A^{\pi}$  for each explored state-action pair.

More specifically, the advantage function is defined as:

$$
A ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t}, \mathbf {a} _ {t}\right) = Q ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t}, \mathbf {a} _ {t}\right) - V ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t}\right). \tag {3}
$$

Here,  $V^{\pi}$  is the state value function, i.e., the expected future-discounted sum of rewards for running the agent on-policy starting from state  $\mathbf{s}_t$ .  $Q^{\pi}(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t)$  is the state-action value function, i.e., expected sum of rewards for taking action  $\mathbf{a}_t$  in state  $\mathbf{s}_t$  and then following the policy,  $Q^{\pi}(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t) = r(\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{a}_t) + \gamma V^{\pi}(\mathbf{s}_{t+1})$ . Thus, the advantage can also be expressed as

$$
A ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t}, \mathbf {a} _ {t}\right) = r \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t}, \mathbf {a} _ {t}\right) + \gamma V ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t + 1}\right) - V ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t}\right). \tag {4}
$$

In practice,  $V^{\pi}$  is usually approximated by a critic network trained with the observed rewards summed over simulation trajectories. However, plugging such an approximation directly to Equation 4 tends to be unstable due to approximation bias. Instead, same as PPO, we use Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al. (2015b)), which is a simple but effective way to estimate  $A^{\pi}$  such that one can trade variance for bias.

# 3 UNDERSTANDING VARIANCE ADAPTATION IN GAUSSIAN POLICY OPTIMIZATION

This paper focuses on the case of continuous control using a Gaussian policy. In other words, the policy network outputs state-dependent mean  $\mu_{\theta}(\mathbf{s})$  and covariance  $\mathbf{C}_{\theta}(\mathbf{s})$  for sampling the actions. The covariance defines the exploration-exploitation balance. In practice, one often uses a diagonal covariance matrix parameterized by a vector  $\mathbf{c}_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}) = \text{diag}(\mathbf{C}_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}))$ . In the most simple case of isotropic unit Gaussian exploration,  $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{I}$ , the loss function in Equation 2 becomes:

$$
\mathcal {L} = - \frac {1}{M} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} A ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {i}, \mathbf {a} _ {i}\right) \left\| \mathbf {a} _ {i} - \mu_ {\theta} (\mathbf {s}) \right\| ^ {2}, \tag {5}
$$

Following the original PPO paper, this paper uses diagonal covariance. This results in a slightly more complex loss function:

$$
\mathcal {L} = - \frac {1}{M} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} A ^ {\pi} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {i}, \mathbf {a} _ {i}\right) \sum_ {j} \left[ \left(a _ {i, j} - \mu_ {j; \theta} (\mathbf {s} _ {i})\right) ^ {2} / c _ {j; \theta} (\mathbf {s} _ {i}) + 0. 5 \log c _ {j; \theta} (\mathbf {s} _ {i}) \right], \tag {6}
$$

where  $i$  indexes over a minibatch and  $j$  indexes over action variables.

# 3.1 THE INSTABILITY CAUSED BY NEGATIVE ADVANTAGES

To gain an intuitive understanding of the training dynamics, it is important to note the following:

- Equation 5 indicates that the policy is trained to approximate the sampled actions, with each action weighted by  $A^{\pi}$ . Equation 5 uses an  $L2$  loss, while Equation 6 uses a Bayesian loss that allows the network to model aleatoric uncertainty, expressed as the free covariance parameters (Kendall & Gal (2017)).  
- As elaborated below, actions with a negative  $A^\pi$  may cause instability, especially when one considers training for several epochs at each iteration using the same data; as pointed out by Schulman et al. (2017), this would be desirable to get the most out of the collected experience.

For actions with positive advantages, training produces a Gaussian approximation where more weight is given to actions with higher advantages. In other words, the policy Gaussian will not diverge outside the proximity of the sampled actions. For negative advantages, each gradient update drives the policy Gaussian further away from the sampled actions. This can easily result in divergence, as shown at the top of Figure 2. In contrast, the bottom of Figure 2 shows how the updates are stable if using only the positive advantage actions. However, in this case the exploration variance shrinks prematurely, leading to poor final convergence.

Similar to Figure 1, Figure 2 depicts a "stateless" didactic example, a special case of Algorithm 1 that allows clear visualization of how the action distribution adapts. We set  $\gamma = 0$ , which simplifies the policy optimization objective  $\mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t} r_{t}] = \mathbb{E}[r_{0}] = \mathbb{E}[r(\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{a})]$ , where  $\mathbf{s}$ ,  $\mathbf{a}$  denote the first state and action of an episode. Further, we use a state-agnostic  $r(\mathbf{a}) = -\mathbf{a}^{T} \mathbf{a}$ . Thus,  $Q^{\pi}(\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{a}) = -\mathbf{a}^{T} \mathbf{a}$ ,  $V^{\pi}(\mathbf{s}) = V^{\pi} = \mathbb{E}[r(\mathbf{a})] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} r(\mathbf{a}_{i})$ , where  $i$  is episode index, and we can compute  $A^{\pi}$  directly using Equation 3. As everything is agnostic of agent state, a simulator is not even needed and one can feed an arbitrary constant input to a policy network. Equivalently, one can simply replace the policy network with optimized variables for the mean and variance of the action distribution.

# 3.2 PROXIMAL POLICY OPTIMIZATION: VARIANCE ADAPTATION PROBLEM

The basic idea of PPO is that one performs minibatch policy gradient updates for several epochs on the data from each iteration of Algorithm 1, while limiting changes to the policy such that it stays in the proximity of the sampled actions (Schulman et al. (2017)). PPO is a simplification of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) (Schulman et al. (2015a)), which uses a more computationally expensive approach to achieve the same.

The original PPO paper proposes two variants: 1) using a loss function that penalizes KL-divergence between the old and updated policies, and 2) using the so-called clipped surrogate loss function that limits the likelihood ratio of old and updated policies  $\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{a}_i|\mathbf{s}_i) / \pi_{old}(\mathbf{a}_i|\mathbf{s}_i)$ . In extensive testing, Schulman et al. (2017) concluded that the clipped surrogate loss with the clipping hyperparameter  $\epsilon = 0.2$  is the recommended choice. This is also the version that we use in this paper in all PPO vs. PPO-CMA comparisons.

Comparing Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows that PPO is more stable than vanilla policy gradient, but can result in somewhat similar premature shrinkage of exploration variance as in the case of only using

the positive advantages for policy gradient. Although Schulman et al. (2017) demonstrated good results in MuJoCo problems with a Gaussian policy, the most impressive Roboschool results did not adapt the variance through gradient updates. Instead, the policy network only output the Gaussian mean and a linearly decaying variance with manually tuned decay rate was used.

# 3.3 COVARIANCE MATRIX ADAPTATION EVOLUTION STRATEGY

The Evolution Strategies (ES) community has worked on similar variance adaptation and Gaussian exploration problems for decades, culminating in the widely used CMA-ES optimization method and its recent variants (Hansen & Ostermeier (2001); Hansen (2006); Beyer & Sendhoff (2017); Loshchilov et al. (2017)). CMA-ES is a black-box optimization method for finding a parameter vector  $\mathbf{x}$  that maximizes some objective or fitness function  $f(\mathbf{x})$ . The CMA-ES core iteration is summarized in Algorithm 2.

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Algorithm 2 High-level summary of CMA-ES</td></tr><tr><td>1:</td><td>for iteration=1,2,... do</td></tr><tr><td>2:</td><td>Draw samples xi ~ N(μ, C).</td></tr><tr><td>3:</td><td>Evaluate f(xi)</td></tr><tr><td>4:</td><td>Sort the samples based on f(xi) and compute weights wi based on the ranks such that best samples have highest weights.</td></tr><tr><td>5:</td><td>Update μ and C using the samples and weights.</td></tr><tr><td>6:</td><td>end for</td></tr></table>

Using the default CMA-ES parameters, the weights of the worst  $50\%$  of samples are set to 0, i.e., those samples are pruned and have no effect. The mean  $\mu$  is updated as a weighted average of the samples, but the covariance update is more involved. Although CMA-ES converges to a single optimum and the sampling distribution is unimodal, the method performs remarkably well on multimodal and/or noisy functions such as Rastrigin if using enough samples per iteration (Hansen & Kern (2004)). For full details of the update process, the reader is referred to Hansen's excellent tutorial (Hansen (2016)).

Usually, CMA-ES and other ES variants are applied to policy optimization in the form of neuroevolution, i.e., directly optimizing the policy network parameters,  $\mathbf{x} \equiv \theta$ , with  $f(\mathbf{x})$  evaluated as the sum of rewards over one or more simulation episodes (Wang et al. (2010); Geijtenbeek et al. (2013); Such et al. (2017)). This is both a benefit and a drawback; neuroevolution is simple to implement and requires no critic network, but on the other hand, the sum of rewards may not be very informative in guiding the optimization. Especially in long episodes, some explored actions may be good and should be learned, but the sum may still be low. In this paper, we are interested in whether ideas from CMA-ES could improve the sampling of actions in RL, using  $\mathbf{x} \equiv \mathbf{a}$ .

Instead of a single action optimization task, RL is in effect solving multiple action optimization tasks in parallel, one for each possible state. The accumulation of rewards over time further complicates matters. However, we can directly apply CMA-ES to our "stateless" didactic example with  $f(\mathbf{x}) \equiv r(\mathbf{a})$ , illustrated in Figure 3. Comparing this to Figure 2 reveals two key insights:

- CMA-ES prunes samples based on sorted fitness values and discards the worst half. This is visually and conceptually similar to computing the policy gradient only using positive advantages, i.e., pruning action samples based on advantage sign. Thus, the advantage function can be thought analogous to the fitness function, although in policy optimization with a continuous state space, one can't directly enumerate, sort, and prune the actions and advantages for each state.  
- Unlike PPO and policy gradient with only positive advantages, CMA-ES avoids the premature variance shrinkage problem. Instead, it increases the variance on objective function slopes to speed up progress and shrinks the variance once the optimum has been found. This can be thought as a form of momentum that acts indirectly through the exploration variance.

CMA-ES expands the exploration variance while progressing on an objective function slope, and shrinks the variance when reaching the optimum.

Considering the above, a good policy optimization approach might be to only use actions with positive advantages, if one could just borrow the variance adaptation techniques of CMA-ES. In the next section, we show that this is indeed possible, resulting in our proposed PPO-CMA algorithm.

# 4 PPO-CMA

Our proposed PPO-CMA algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 3. Source code is available at GitHub<sup>3</sup>. PPO-CMA is simple to implement, only requiring minor changes to vanilla PPO, defined on Algorithm 3 lines 8-10:

- We use the standard policy gradient loss in Equation 6.  
- We train only on actions with positive advantage estimates, i.e., we implement CMA-ES -style pruning of actions, but based on advantage sign instead of sorted fitness function values. As explained in Section 3.1, this also ensures that the policy stays in the proximity of the data without an explicit PPO-style KL-divergence penalty or the clipped surrogate loss function.  
- We use separate neural networks for policy mean and variance, trained in separate passes. We also maintain a history of training data over  $H$  iterations, used for training the variance network. As elaborated below, these result in the CMA-ES -style variance adaptation behavior shown in Figure 1.

10: Train policy mean for  $K$  epochs using the experience from this iteration and Eq. 6

# 4.1 TWO-STEP UPDATING OF MEAN AND COVARIANCE

Superficially, the core iteration loop of CMA-ES is similar to other optimization approaches with recursive sampling and distribution fitting such as the Cross-Entropy Method (De Boer et al. (2005)) and Estimation of Multivariate Normal Algorithm (EMNA) (Larrañaga & Lozano (2001)). However, there is a crucial difference: CMA-ES first updates the covariance and only then updates the mean (Hansen (2016)). This has the effect of elongating the exploration distribution along the best search directions instead of shrinking the variance prematurely, as shown in Figure 4. This has also been shown to correspond to a natural gradient update of the exploration distribution (Ollivier et al. (2017)).

In PPO-CMA, we implement the two-step update by using separate neural networks for the mean and variance. We first train the variance network while keeping the mean fixed, and then vice versa, using the Gaussian policy gradient loss in Equation 6.

# 4.2 EVOLUTION PATH

CMA-ES also features the so-called evolution path heuristic, where a component  $\alpha \mathbf{p}^{(i)}\mathbf{p}^{(i)T}$  is added to the covariance, where  $\alpha$  is a scalar, the  $(i)$  superscript denotes iteration index, and  $\mathbf{p}$  is the evolution path (Hansen (2016)):

$$
\mathbf {p} ^ {(i)} = \beta_ {0} \mathbf {p} ^ {(i - 1)} + \beta_ {1} \left(\boldsymbol {\mu} ^ {(i)} - \boldsymbol {\mu} ^ {(i - 1)}\right). \tag {7}
$$

Although the exact computation of the default  $\beta_0$  and  $\beta_{1}$  multipliers is rather involved, Equation 7 essentially amounts to first-order low-pass filtering of the steps taken by the distribution mean between iterations. When CMA-ES progresses along a continuous slope of the fitness landscape,  $||\mathbf{p}||$  is large, and the covariance is elongated and exploration is increased along the progress direction. Near convergence, when CMA-ES zigzags around the optimum in a random walk,  $||\mathbf{p}||\approx 0$  and the evolution path heuristic has no effect.

In policy optimization, policy mean and variance depend on the agent state and should be adapted differently at different parts of the state space. For some states, the policy may already be nearly

converged while exploration is still needed for other states. Thus, in principle, one would need yet another neural network to maintain and approximate a state-dependent  $\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{s})$ , which might be unstable. Fortunately, one can achieve a similar effect by simply keeping a history of  $H$  iterations of data and sampling the variance training minibatches from the history instead of only the latest data. Same as the original evolution path heuristic, this elongates the variance for a given state if the mean is moving in a consistent direction.

Appendix B provides an empirical analysis of the effect of different  $H$  values. Values larger than 1 minimize the probability of low-reward outliers, and PPO-CMA does not appear to be highly sensitive to the exact choice.

# 5 EVALUATION

We evaluate PPO-CMA using the 7-task MuJoCo-1M benchmark used by Schulman et al. (2017) plus the more difficult 3D humanoid locomotion task. We performed the following experiments:

- The blue and red curves in Figure 5 visualize the results using PPO-CMA and PPO with exactly same implementation and hyperparameters. This ensures that the differences are due to algorithm changes instead of hyperparameters. PPO-CMA performs better in 7 out of 8 tasks. The hyperparameters are detailed in Appendix B.  
- To test whether our results generalize to other hyperparameter settings, we generated 50 random hyperparameter combinations as detailed in Appendix C, and used them to train the 2D walker using both PPO and PPO-CMA. After 1M simulation steps, PPO-CMA and PPO achieved mean episode reward of 393 and 161, respectively. The standard deviations were 208 and 81. A Welch t-test indicates that the difference is statistically significant  $(p < 0.001)$ . Although the individual training runs have high reward variance, PPO-CMA wins in 47 out of 50 runs.  
- Reinforcement learning algorithms are notoriously sensitive to implementation details, and even closely related algorithms might have different optimal parameters. Thus, to compare our results against a finetuned PPO implementation, Figure 5 also shows the performance

of OpenAI's baseline PPO  ${}^{4}$  . In this case, PPO-CMA produces better results in 4 out of 8 tasks.

Overall, PPO-CMA often progresses somewhat slower but appears less likely to diverge or stop improving.

Appendix A provides further comparisons that also visualize the variance adaptation behavior. To augment the visual comparison, Appendix C presents statistical significance testing results.

# 6 RELATED WORK

In addition to PPO, our work is closely related to Continuous Actor Critic Learning Automaton (CACLA) (van Hasselt & Wiering (2007)). Similar to PPO-CMA, CACLA uses the sign of the advantage estimate – in their case the TD-residual – in the updates, shifting policy mean towards actions with positive sign. The paper also observes that using actions with negative advantages can have an adverse effect. In light of our discussion of how only using positive advantage actions guarantees that the policy stays in the proximity of the collected experience, CACLA can be viewed as an early Proximal Policy Optimization approach, which we extend with CMA-ES style variance adaptation.

Although PPO is based on a traditional policy gradient formulation, there is a line of research suggesting that the so-called natural gradient can be more efficient in optimization (Amari (1998); Wierstra et al. (2008); Ollivier et al. (2017)). Through the connection between CMA-ES and natural gradient, PPO-CMA is related to various natural gradient RL methods (Kakade (2002); Peters & Schaal (2008); Wu et al. (2017)), although the evolution path heuristic is not motivated from the natural gradient perspective (Ollivier et al. (2017)).

PPO represents on-policy RL methods, i.e., experience is assumed to be collected on-policy and thus must be discarded after the policy is updated. Theoretically, off-policy RL should allow better sample efficiency through the reuse of old experience, often implemented using an experience replay buffer, introduced by Lin (1993) and recently brought back to fashion (e.g., Mnih et al. (2015); Lillicrap et al. (2015); Schaul et al. (2015); Wang et al. (2016)). PPO-CMA can be considered as a hybrid method, since the policy mean is updated using on-policy experience, but the history or replay buffer for the variance update also includes older off-policy experience.

In addition to neuroevolution (discussed in Section 3.3), CMA-ES has been applied to continuous control in the form of trajectory optimization. In this case, one searches for a sequence of optimal controls given an initial state, and CMA-ES and other sampling-based approaches (Al Borno et al. (2013); Hämäläinen et al. (2014; 2015); Liu et al. (2016)) complement variants of Differential Dynamic Programming, where the optimization utilizes gradient information (Tassa et al. (2012; 2014)). Although trajectory optimization approaches have demonstrated impressive results with complex humanoid characters, they require more computing resources in run-time.

Finally, it should be noted that PPO-CMA falls in the domain of model-free reinforcement learning approaches. In contrast, there are several model-based methods that learn approximate models of the simulation dynamics and use the models for policy optimization, potentially requiring less simulated or real experience. Both ES and RL approaches can be used for the optimization (Chatzi-lygeroudis et al. (2018)). Model-based algorithms are an active area of research, with recent work demonstrating excellent results in limited MuJoCo benchmarks (Chua et al. (2018)), but model-free approaches still dominate the most complex continuous problems such as humanoid movement.

# 7 CONCLUSION

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a simple, powerful, and widely used model-free reinforcement learning approach. However, we have shown that in continuous control with Gaussian policy,

PPO can adapt the exploration variance in an unreliable manner, which explains how PPO may converge slowly or get stuck in local optima.

As a solution to the variance adaptation problem, we have proposed the PPO-CMA algorithm that implements two-step update and evolution path heuristics inspired by the CMA-ES black-box optimization method. This results in an improved PPO version that is simple to implement but beats the original method in many MuJoCo tasks, is less prone to getting stuck in local optima, and provides a new link between RL and ES approaches to policy optimization.

Additionally, our simulations in Appendix A show that PPO's premature convergence can also be prevented with simple clipping of the policy variance or using the entropy loss term proposed by Schulman et al. (2017). However, the clipping limit or entropy loss weight needs delicate finetuning and both techniques also result in a more noisy final policy.

On a more general level, one can draw the following conclusions and algorithm design insights from our work:

- To understand the differences, similarities, and problems of policy optimization methods, it can be useful to visualize "stateless" special cases such as the one in Figure 1. PPO's problems were not at all clear to us until we created the visualizations, originally meant for teaching.  
- It can be possible to adapt a black-box optimization method like CMA-ES for policy optimization by 1) treating the advantage function as the fitness function, 2) approximating sorting and pruning operations as clipping advantage values below a limit to zero (sorting is not possible because with a continuous state space, one can't enumerate all the actions sampled for a given state), and 3) considering algorithm state such as exploration mean and variance as functions of agent state instead of plain variables, and encoding them as weights of multiple neural networks to allow independent updates. Essentially, the fitness-advantage analogue allows one to think that multiple parallel CMA-ES optimizations of actions are being done for different agent states, and the neural networks store and interpolate algorithm state as a function of agent state.  
- Our work highlights how gradient-based RL can have problems if the gradient affects exploration in subsequent iterations, which is the case with Gaussian policies. The fundamental problem is that a gradient that causes an increase in the expected rewards does not guarantee further increases in subsequent iterations. Instead, one should adapt exploration such that it provides good results over the whole training process. We have shown that one way to achieve this can be through an approximation of CMA-ES variance adaptation.

Thinking of the advantage function not as a way to compute accurate gradient but as a tool for pruning the learned actions also begs the question of what other pruning methods might be applicable. Presently, we are experimenting with continuous control Monte Carlo Tree Search methods (e.g., Rajamaki & Hämäläinen (2018)) for better exploration and pruning.
