# ABSTRACT

Recently, there has been a growing surge of interest in enabling machine learning systems to generalize well to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Most efforts are devoted to advancing optimization objectives that regularize models to capture the underlying invariance; however, there often are compromises in the optimization process of these OOD objectives: i) Many OOD objectives have to be relaxed as penalty terms of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for the ease of optimization, while the relaxed forms can weaken the robustness of the original objective; ii) The penalty terms also require careful tuning of the penalty weights due to the intrinsic conflicts between ERM and OOD objectives. Consequently, these compromises could easily lead to suboptimal performance of either the ERM or OOD objective. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-objective optimization (MOO) perspective to understand the OOD optimization process, and propose a new optimization scheme called PAreto Invariant Risk Minimization (PAIR). PAIR improves the robustness of OOD objectives by cooperatively optimizing with other OOD objectives, thereby bridging the gaps caused by the relaxations. Then PAIR approaches a Pareto optimal solution that trades off the ERM and OOD objectives properly. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, WILDS, show that PAIR alleviates the compromises and yields top OOD performances.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The interplay between optimization and generalization is crucial to the success of deep learning (Zhang et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2019; Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Jacot et al., 2021; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2021). Guided by empirical risk minimization (ERM) (Vapnik, 1991), simple optimization algorithms can find uneventful descent paths in the non-convex loss landscape of deep neural networks (Sagun et al., 2018). However, when distribution shifts are present, the optimization is usually biased by spurious signals such that the learned models can fail dramatically in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data (Beery et al., 2018; DeGrave et al., 2021; Geirhos et al., 2020). Therefore, overcoming the OOD generalization challenge has drawn much attention recently. Most efforts are devoted to proposing better optimization objectives (Rojas-Carulla et al., 2018; Koyama & Yamaguchi, 2020; Parascandolo et al., 2021; Krueger et al., 2021; Creager et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Pezeshki et al., 2021; Ahuja et al., 2021a; Wald et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2022; Rame et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022) that regularize the gradient signals produced by ERM, while it has been long neglected that the interplay between optimization and generalization under distribution shifts has already changed its nature.

In fact, the optimization process of the OOD objectives turns out to be substantially more challenging than ERM. There are often compromises when applying the OOD objectives in practice. Due to the optimization difficulty, many OOD objectives have to be relaxed as penalty terms of ERM in practice (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Koyama & Yamaguchi, 2020; Krueger et al., 2021; Pezeshki et al., 2021; Ahuja et al., 2021a; Rame et al., 2021), but the relaxed formulations can behave very differently from the original objective (Kamath et al., 2021) (Fig. 1(a)). Moreover, due to the generally existing gradient conflicts between ERM and OOD objectives (Fig. 1(b)), trade-offs among ERM and OOD performance during the optimization are often needed. Sagawa* et al. (2020); Zhai et al. (2022) suggest that ERM performance usually needs to be sacrificed for better OOD generalization. On the other hand, it usually requires careful tuning of the OOD penalty hyperparameters (Zhang et al., 2022a) (Fig. 1(d)), which however either weakens the power of OOD objectives or makes them too strong that prevents models from capturing all desirable patterns. Consequently, using the traditional optimization wisdom to train and select models can easily lead to suboptimal performance of either

Figure 1: Optimization issues in OOD algorithms. (a) OOD objectives such as IRM usually require several relaxations for the ease of optimization, which however introduces huge gaps. The ellipsoids denote solutions that satisfy the invariance constraints of practical IRM variant IRMv1. When optimized with ERM, IRMv1 prefers  $f_{1}$  instead of  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}}$  (The predictor produced by IRM). (b) The gradient conflicts between ERM and OOD objectives generally exist for different objectives at different penalty weights ( $x$ -axis). (c) The typically used linear weighting scheme to combine ERM and OOD objectives requires careful tuning of the weights to approach the solution. However, the scheme cannot reach any solutions in the non-convex part of the Pareto front. In contrast, PAIR finds an adaptive descent direction under gradient conflicts that leads to the desired solution. (d) Due to the optimization dilemma, the best OOD performance (e.g., IRMv1 w.r.t. a modified COLOREDMNIST from Sec. 5) usually requires exhaustive tuning of hyperparameters ( $y$ -axis: penalty weights;  $x$ -axis: pretraining epochs), while PAIR robustly yields top performances by resolving the compromises.

ERM or OOD objectives. Most OOD objectives remain struggling with distribution shifts or even underperform ERM (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021; Koh et al., 2021). This phenomenon calls for a better understanding of the optimization in OOD generalization, and raises a challenging question:

How can one obtain a desired OOD solution under the conflicts of ERM and OOD objectives?

To answer this question, we take a multi-objective optimization (MOO) perspective of the OOD optimization. Specifically, using the representative OOD objective IRM (Arjovsky et al., 2019) as an example, we find that the failures in OOD optimization can be attributed to two issues. The first one is the compromised robustness of OOD objectives due to the relaxation in the practical variants. In fact, it can even eliminate the desired invariant solution from the Pareto front w.r.t. the ERM and the OOD penalty (Fig. 1(a)). Therefore, merely optimizing the ERM and the relaxed OOD penalty can hardly approach the desired solution. On the other hand, when the Pareto front contains the desired solution, as shown in Fig. 1(c), using the traditional linear weighting scheme that linearly reweights the ERM and OOD objectives, cannot reach the solution if it lies in the non-convex part of the front (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2014). Even when the OOD solution is reachable (i.e., lies in the convex part), it still requires careful tuning of the OOD penalty weights to approach the solution, as shown in Fig. 1(d).

To address these issues, we propose a new optimization scheme for OOD generalization, called PAreto Invariant Risk Minimization (PAIR), which includes a new optimizer (PAIR-0) and a new model selection criteria (PAIR-s). Owing to the MOO formulation, PAIR-0 allows for cooperative optimization with other OOD objectives to improve the robustness of practical OOD objectives. Despite the huge gaps between IRMv1 and IRM, we show that incorporating VReX (Krueger et al., 2021) into IRMv1 provably recovers the causal invariance (Arjovsky et al., 2019) for some group of problem instances (Sec. 3.2). When given robust OOD objectives, PAIR-0 finds a descent path with adaptive penalty weights, which leads to a Pareto optimal solution that trades off ERM and OOD performance properly (Sec. 4). In addition, the MOO analysis also motivates PAIR-s, which facilitates the OOD model selection by considering the trade-offs between ERM and OOD objectives.

We conducted extensive experiments on challenging OOD benchmarks. Empirical results show that PAIR-  $\mathbb{O}$  successfully alleviates the objective conflicts and empowers IRMv1 to achieve high performance in 6 datasets from WILDS (Koh et al., 2021). PAIR-s effectively improves the performance of selected OOD models up to  $10\%$  across 3 datasets from DOMAINBED (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021), demonstrating the significance of considering the ERM and OOD trade-offs in optimization.

# 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

We first briefly introduce the background of our work (more details are given in Appendix A).

Problem setup. The problem of OOD generalization typically considers a supervised learning setting based on the data  $\mathcal{D} = \{\mathcal{D}^e\}_{e\in \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{all}}}$  collected from multiple causally related environments  $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{all}}$ , where a subset of samples  $\mathcal{D}^e = \{X_i^e,Y_i^e\}$  from a single environment  $e\in \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{all}}$  are drawn independently from an identical distribution  $\mathbb{P}^e$  (Peters et al., 2016). Given the data from training environments  $\{\mathcal{D}^e\}_{e\in \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}}}$ , the goal of OOD generalization is to find a predictor  $f:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{Y}$  that generalizes well to all (unseen) environments, i.e., to minimize  $\max_{e\in \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{all}}}\mathcal{L}_e(f)$ , where  $\mathcal{L}_e$  is the empirical risk under environment  $e$ . The predictor  $f = w\circ \varphi$  is usually composed of a featurizer  $\varphi :\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \mathcal{Z}$  that learns to extract useful features, and a classifier  $w:\mathcal{Z}\to \mathcal{Y}$  that makes predictions from the extracted features.

Existing solutions to OOD generalization. There exists a rich literature aiming to overcome the OOD generalization challenge, which usually appear as additional regularizations of ERM (Vapnik, 1991). Ganin et al. (2016); Sun & Saenko (2016); Li et al. (2018); Dou et al. (2019) try to regularize the learned features to be domain-invariant. Namkoong & Duchi (2016); Hu et al. (2018); Sagawa* et al. (2020) regularize the models to be robust to mild distributional perturbations of the training distributions, and Liu et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2022b); Yao et al. (2022) further improve the robustness with additional assumptions. Recently there is increasing interest in adopting the theory of causality (Pearl, 2009; Scholkopf et al., 2021) and introduce the causal invariance to the learned representations (Peters et al., 2016; Rojas-Carulla et al., 2018; Arjovsky et al., 2019; Creager et al., 2021; Parascandolo et al., 2021; Wald et al., 2021; Ahuja et al., 2021a). They mostly follow the intuition that: When a predictor  $w$  acting on  $\varphi$  minimizes the risks in all of the environments simultaneously,  $\varphi$  is expected to discard the spurious signals while keeping the causally invariant signals. In addition, Koyama & Yamaguchi (2020); Krueger et al. (2021); Shi et al. (2022); Rame et al. (2021) encourage agreements at various levels across different environments.

Optimization dilemma in OOD generalization. Along with the development of OOD methods, the optimization dilemma in OOD generalization is gradually perceived in the literature. Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz (2021) find that many OOD algorithms cannot outperform ERM in domain generalization under rigorous hyperparameter tuning. Sagawa* et al. (2020); Zhai et al. (2022) find that sacrificing ERM performance is usually needed for achieving satisfactory OOD performance. Lv et al. (2021) leverage MOO to resolve the gradient conflicts and achieve better performance in domain adaption, under the guidance of the data that has a similar distribution to test environment. Zhang et al. (2022a) propose to construct better initializations for OOD regularization to yield stable OOD performance under the dilemma. Although Lv et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2022a) are also motivated by part of the observations of OOD optimization dilemma, they do not explain the reasons of the dilemma or give direct solutions. In contrast, our work provides a detailed analysis of the challenges in OOD optimization and derive direct solutions from the optimization perspective.

Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO). MOO considers solving  $m$  objectives, w.r.t.  $\{\mathcal{L}_i\}_{i=1}^m$  losses, i.e.,  $\min_{\theta} \boldsymbol{L}(\theta) = (\mathcal{L}_1(\theta), \dots, \mathcal{L}_m(\theta))^T$  (Kaisa, 1999). A solution  $\theta$  dominates another  $\bar{\theta}$ , i.e.,  $\boldsymbol{L}(\theta) \preceq \boldsymbol{L}(\bar{\theta})$ , if  $\mathcal{L}_i(\theta) \leq \mathcal{L}_i(\bar{\theta})$  for all  $i$  and  $\boldsymbol{L}(\theta) \neq \boldsymbol{L}(\bar{\theta})$ . A solution  $\theta^*$  is called Pareto optimal if there exists no other solution that dominates  $\theta^*$ . The set of Pareto optimal solutions is called Pareto set and its image is called Pareto front, denoted as  $\mathcal{P}$ . In practice, it is usual that one cannot find a global optimal solution for all objectives, hence Pareto optimal solutions are of particular value. The multiple-gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) (Désidéri, 2012) can efficiently find the Pareto optimal solutions, and has been widely applied in multi-task learning (Sener & Koltun, 2018).

# 3 OPTIMIZATION CHALLENGES IN IRM AND ITS EFFECTIVE FIX

We start by analyzing one of the most representative OOD objectives, i.e., IRM (Arjovsky et al., 2019), to show how we can understand and mitigate the optimization dilemma from the MOO perspective.

# 3.1 DRAWBACKS OF IRM IN PRACTICE

We first introduce the basics of IRM and the drawbacks of its practical variants, and leave theoretical details in Appendix B.1. Specifically, the IRM framework approaches OOD generalization by finding an invariant representation  $\varphi$ , such that there exists a classifier acting on  $\varphi$  that is simultaneously optimal in  $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}}$ . Hence, IRM leads to a challenging bi-level optimization problem as

$$
\min  _ {w, \varphi} \sum_ {e \in \mathcal {E} _ {\mathrm {t r}}} \mathcal {L} _ {e} (w \circ \varphi), \text {s . t .} w \in \underset {\bar {w}: \mathcal {Z} \rightarrow \mathcal {Y}} {\arg \min } \mathcal {L} _ {e} (\bar {w} \circ \varphi), \forall e \in \mathcal {E} _ {\mathrm {t r}}. \tag {1}
$$

Given the training environments  $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}}$ , and functional spaces  $\mathcal{W}$  for  $w$  and  $\varPhi$  for  $\varphi$ , predictors  $f = w \circ \varphi$  satisfying the constraint in Eq. 1 are called invariant predictors, denoted as  $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}})$ . When solving for invariant predictors, characterizing  $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}})$  is particularly difficult in practice, hence it is natural to restrict  $\mathcal{W}$  to be the space of linear functions on  $\mathcal{Z} = \mathbb{R}^d$  (Jacot et al., 2021). Furthermore, Arjovsky et al. (2019) argue that linear classifiers actually do not provide additional representation power than scalar classifiers, i.e.,  $d = 1$ ,  $\mathcal{W} = \mathcal{S} = \mathbb{R}^1$ . The scalar restriction elicits a practical variant IRMS as

$$
\min  _ {\varphi} \sum_ {e \in \mathcal {E} _ {\mathrm {t r}}} \mathcal {L} _ {e} (\varphi), \text {s . t .} \nabla_ {w | w = 1} \mathcal {L} _ {e} (w \cdot \varphi) = 0, \forall e \in \mathcal {E} _ {\mathrm {t r}}. \tag {2}
$$

Since Eq. 2 remains a constrained programming. Arjovsky et al. (2019) further introduce a soften-constrained variant, called IRMv1, as the following

$$
\min  _ {\varphi} \sum_ {e \in \mathcal {E} _ {\mathrm {t r}}} \mathcal {L} _ {e} (\varphi) + \lambda | \nabla_ {w | w = 1} \mathcal {L} _ {e} (w \cdot \varphi) | ^ {2}. \tag {3}
$$

Theoretical failure of practical IRM variants. Although the practical variants seem promising, the relaxations introduce huge gaps between IRM and the practical variants, so that both  $\mathrm{IRM}_S$  and IRMv1 can fail to capture the invariance (Kamath et al., 2021). The failure case is illustrated by the two-bit environment with  $\alpha_{e},\beta_{e}\in [0,1]$ . Each environment  $\mathcal{D}_e = \{X^e,Y^e\}$  is generated following

$$
Y ^ {e} := \operatorname {R a d} (0. 5), X ^ {e} := \left(X _ {1} ^ {e}, X _ {2} ^ {e}\right), X _ {1} ^ {e} := Y ^ {e} \cdot \operatorname {R a d} \left(\alpha_ {e}\right), X _ {2} ^ {e} := Y ^ {e} \cdot \operatorname {R a d} \left(\beta_ {e}\right), \tag {4}
$$

where  $\operatorname{Rad}(\sigma)$  is a random variable taking value  $-1$  with probability  $\sigma$  and  $+1$  with probability  $1 - \sigma$ . Each environment is denoted as  $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha} = \{(\alpha, \beta_e) : 0 < \beta_e < 1\}$  where  $X_1^e$  is the invariant feature as  $\alpha$  is fixed for different environment  $e$ , and  $X_2^e$  is the spurious feature as  $\beta_e$  varies across different  $e$ .

Let  $\mathcal{I}_S(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}})$  denote the set of invariant predictors elicited by the relaxed constraint in  $\mathrm{IRM}_S$ . It follows that  $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}}) \subseteq \mathcal{I}_S(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}})$ . Consequently, there exist some undesired predictors but considered "invariant" by  $\mathrm{IRM}_S$  and  $\mathrm{IRMv1}$ . For example, in  $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}} = \{(0.1, 0.11), (0.1, 0.4)\}$ , the solutions satisfying the constraint in  $\mathrm{IRM}_S$  are those intersected points in Fig. 1(a) (The ellipsoids are the constraints). Although  $f_1, f_{\mathrm{IRM}} \in \mathcal{I}_S(\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}})$ , both  $\mathrm{IRM}_S$  and  $\mathrm{IRMv1}$  prefer  $f_1$  instead of  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}}$  (the predictor produced by  $\mathrm{IRM}$ ), as  $f_1$  has the smallest ERM loss. In fact, Kamath et al. (2021) show that the failure can happen in a wide range of environments even given infinite amount of environments and samples, demonstrating the huge gap between the practical and the original IRM variants.

Empirical drawback of practical IRM variants. In addition, the optimization of IRMv1 introduces more challenges due to the conflicts between the IRMv1 penalty and ERM objective. As shown in Fig. 1(d), it often requires significant efforts to tune the hyperparameters such as pretraining epochs and penalty weights  $\lambda$  in Eq. 3. Otherwise, the IRMv1 penalty could be either too weak to enforce the invariance as required by IRM, or too strong that prevents ERM from learning all desirable patterns.

# 3.2 PARETO OPTIMIZATION FOR IRM

As shown that both  $\mathrm{IRM}_S$  and IRMv1 fail to properly trade off between ERM and IRM objectives, we switch to a new perspective, i.e., the lens of MOO, to understand the failures of IRM in practice.

Understanding the IRM failures through the MOO perspective. To begin with, it is natural to reformulate the practical IRM problem (Eq. 3) as an MOO problem:

$$
\min  _ {C} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {\text {E R M}}, \mathcal {L} _ {\text {I R M}}\right) ^ {T}, \tag {5}
$$

where  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ERM}} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}}|}\sum_{e\in \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}}}\mathcal{L}_e$  denotes the ERM loss, and  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{IRM}} = \sum_{e}|\nabla_{w|w = 1}\mathcal{L}_e(w\cdot \varphi)|^2$  denotes the practical IRMv1 loss. To understand the behaviors of solutions to Eq. 5, We visualize the Pareto front w.r.t.  $\{\mathcal{L}_e\}_{e\in \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}}}$  using the previous failure case in Fig. 1(a).

![](images/7a7642239dd09508b3f701283832b6936e2d5bf0662caa021699acaf9cb682e9.jpg)  
Figure 2: Pareto front of ERM losses w.r.t. environments.

Let  $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}_1(\theta),\dots,\mathcal{L}_m(\theta))$  denote the set of Pareto optimal solutions w.r.t.  $(\mathcal{L}_1(\theta),\dots,\mathcal{L}_m(\theta))$ . As shown in Fig. 2, at first, we can find that  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}} \notin \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}_1,\mathcal{L}_2)$ . In other words, solving any environment-reweighted ERM losses cannot obtain  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}}$ . Moreover, together with Fig. 1(a), the failure remains even combined with the  $\mathrm{IRM}_{S}$  or  $\mathrm{IRMv1}$ , i.e.,  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}} \notin \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}_1,\mathcal{L}_2,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{IRM}})$ , hence  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}} \notin \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ERM}},\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{IRM}})$ , as  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}}$  is dominated by  $f_1$ . Therefore, no matter how we carefully control the optimization process, we cannot obtain  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}}$  by merely minimizing the objectives in Eq. 5. This is essentially because of the weakened OOD robustness of  $\mathrm{IRM}_{S}$  and  $\mathrm{IRMv1}$  caused by the relaxations.

Thus, choosing robust objectives for optimization is of great importance to OOD generalization. The ideal objectives should at least constitute a Pareto front that contains the desired OOD solution.

Improving OOD robustness of practical IRM variants. In pursuit of proper optimization objectives, we resort to the OOD extrapolation explanation of IRM (Bottou et al., 2019). A solution that is simultaneously optimal to all training environments (i.e., satisfying the original IRM constraints) is also a stationary point of ERM loss w.r.t. some OOD distribution:

$$
\partial \mathcal {L} _ {t} / \partial f _ {\mathrm {I R M}} = \mathbf {0}, \mathcal {L} _ {t} \in \left\{\sum_ {e \in \mathcal {E} _ {\mathrm {t r}}} \lambda_ {e} \mathcal {L} _ {e} \mid \sum_ {e \in \mathcal {E} _ {\mathrm {t r}}} \lambda_ {e} = 1 \right\}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\mathcal{L}_t$  is the ERM loss under the OOD distribution. Different

Figure 3: Variance distribution.

from Distributionally Robust Optimization approaches (Namkoong & Duchi, 2016), Eq. 6 allows for some negative  $\lambda_{e}$  and hence its solutions are expected to extrapolate better (Bottou et al., 2019).

The previous failure case implies that both  $\mathrm{IRM}_{\mathcal{S}}$  and IRMv1 fail in the extrapolation due to the relaxations, nevertheless, we can introduce additional objectives to directly improve the OOD extrapolation power of the practical IRM variants. To this end, we introduce the REx objective to IRMv1, which is derived by directly minimizing the worst case ERM loss under all OOD distributions up to a certain distance from the training distributions (Krueger et al., 2021). More formally, REx minimizes the worst case  $\mathcal{L}_t$  under an additional constraint of  $\{\lambda_e\}_{e\in \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}}} \geq -\beta$  in Eq. 6. For the ease of optimization, they also propose an alternative objective as  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VREx}} := \mathrm{var}(\{\mathcal{L}_e\}_{e\in \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{tr}}})$ . In Fig. 3, we plot the distribution of  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VREx}}$  in the the failure case of Fig. 1(a). It can be found that,  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}}$  lies in the low variance region. Similarly, in Fig. 2, the zero variance solutions (shown as the purple line at middle) points out the underlying  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}}$  beyond the Pareto front. Therefore, incorporating  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VREx}}$  in Eq. 5 can relocate  $f_{\mathrm{IRM}}$  into the Pareto front, which implies the desirable objectives as the following

$$
\left(\operatorname {I R M X}\right) \quad \min  _ {\varphi} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {E R M}}, \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {I R M}}, \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {V R E x}}\right) ^ {T}. \tag {7}
$$

By resolving a large class of failure cases of  $\mathrm{IRM}_S$  and  $\mathrm{IRMv1}$  (Kamath et al., 2021), solutions to Eq. 7 are more powerful than those to  $\mathrm{IRM}_S$  and  $\mathrm{IRMv1}$  in OOD extrapolation. In fact, we have

Proposition 1. (Informal) Under Setting A (Kamath et al. (2021)), for all  $\alpha \in (0,1)$ , let  $\mathcal{E} \coloneqq \{(\alpha, \beta_e) : \beta_e \in (0,1)\}$  be any instance of the two-bit environment (Eq. 4),  $\mathcal{I}_X$  denote the invariant predictors produced by Eq. 7, it holds that  $\mathcal{I}_X(\mathcal{E}) = \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{E})$ .<sup>1</sup>

The formal description and proof of Proposition 1 are given in Appendix D.1. Proposition 1 implies that Eq. 7 are the ideal objectives for optimization. However, Eq. 7 can even add up the difficulty of OOD penalty tunning. It introduces one more penalty to the overall objective that makes the Pareto front more complicated for the linear weighting scheme to find the desired solution.

Pareto optimization for IRMX. In fact, the family of MGDA algorithms provide useful tools to approach the Pareto optimal solutions (Désidéri, 2012). Ideally, the set of Pareto optimal solutions is small such that each  $f \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ERM}}, \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{IRM}}, \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VREx}})$  satisfies the invariance constraints of IRMv1 and VREx, i.e.,  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{IRM}} = 0$  and  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VREx}} = 0$ , and with minimal  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ERM}}$ , thereby eliciting the desired OOD solutions. However, the ideal constraints might be too strong to be achieved when there are noises among invariant features and labels (Duchin et al., 2020; Ahuja et al., 2021b). Therefore, it is natural to relax the constraints as  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{IRM}} \leq \epsilon_{\mathrm{IRM}}$  and  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VREx}} \leq \epsilon_{\mathrm{VREx}}$ . When  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{IRM}} \rightarrow 0$ ,  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{VREx}} \rightarrow 0$ , it recovers the ideal invariance. To obtain a desired solution under these circumstances, the optimization process is expected to meet the following two necessities:

(i). The additional objective in IRMX can make the Pareto front more complicated such that the desired solutions are more likely to appear in the non-convex part, which are however not reachable by the linear weighting scheme (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2014). Therefore, the optimizer needs to be able to reach any Pareto optimal solutions in the front, e.g., MGDA-based optimizer (Désideri, 2012).  
(ii). When both  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{IRM}}$ ,  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{VREx}} > 0$ , there can be multiple Pareto optimal solutions while there are few desired OOD solutions. Hence a preference of ERM and OOD objectives is usually needed. As the optimality of each OOD objective usually appears as a necessary condition for satisfactory OOD performance, the preferences for OOD objectives are expected to be higher.

Figure 4: Recovery of causal invariance. The causal invariance (Definition. 3.1) requires the model predictions to be independent of the spurious features within the overlapped invariant features. In this example, intuitively it requires the colored belts to be perpendicular to  $x$ -axis within  $[-2, 2]$ . It can be found that PAIR succeeds out of IRMv1 and VREx in recovering the causal invariance.

(d) PAIR.

Given the two requirements, we leverage a preference-aware MOO solver to solve IRMX for the desired Pareto optimal solution (Mahapatra & Rajan, 2020). We summarize the overall solution as PAreTo Invariant Risk Minimization (PAIR). When assigning a high preference to  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{IRM}}$  and  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VREx}}$  in IRMX (Eq. 7), PAIR approaches a Pareto optimal solution that minimizes the OOD losses while not sacrificing the ERM performance too much, and has good OOD performance, shown as in Table. 1.

# 3.3 RECOVERY OF CAUSAL INVARIANCE

To better understand how PAIR bridges the gaps between the practical and original IRM objectives, we examine to what extent PAIR can recover the causal invariance specified by Arjovsky et al. (2019) in a more difficult case. More formally, the causal invariance is defined as follows.

Definition 3.1. (Causal Invariance) Given a predictor  $f \coloneqq w \circ \varphi$ , the representation produced by the featurizer  $\varphi$  is invariant over  $\mathcal{E}_{\text{all}}$  if and only if for all  $e_1, e_2 \in \mathcal{E}_{\text{all}}$ , it holds that

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {e _ {1}}} [ Y | \varphi (X) = z ] = \mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {e _ {2}}} [ Y | \varphi (X) = z ],
$$

for all  $z\in \mathcal{Z}_{\varphi}^{e_1}\cap \mathcal{Z}_{\varphi}^{e_2}$  , where  $\mathcal{Z}_{\varphi}^{e}:= \{\varphi (X)|(X,Y)\in supp(\mathcal{D}_{e})\}$

Following Definition 3.1, we construct a regression problem. As shown in Fig. 4,  $Y = \sin(X_1) + 1$  is solely determined by  $X_1$ , i.e., the values of the  $x$ -axis, while  $X_2$  is the values of  $y$ -axis and does not influence the values of  $Y$ . Different colors indicate different values of  $Y$ . In this problem, the invariant representation  $\varphi$  should only take  $X_1$  and discard  $X_2$ . We sampled two training environments as denoted by the ellipsoids colored in red, among which the overlapped region of the invariant features  $X_1$  is  $[-2, 2]$ . Hence the prediction produced by the invariant predictor following Definition 3.1 is expected to be independent of  $X_2$ . In other words, the plotted belts need to be perpendicular to the  $x$ -axis within the overlapped invariant features  $[-2, 2]$ . More details can be found in Appendix B.3.

We plot predictions with the best MSE losses of IRMv1 and VREx in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c), respectively. Although both IRMv1 and VREx fail to achieve the causal invariance as expected, perhaps surprisingly, PAIR almost recovers the causal invariance, as shown in Fig. 4(d).

# 4 PARETO INVARIANT RISK MINIMIZATION

The success of PAIR in empowering unrobust IRMv1 to achieve the causal invariance of IRM demonstrates the significance of considering the trade-offs between ERM and OOD objectives in the optimization. In the next, we will summarize our findings and elaborate PAIR in more details.

# 4.1 METHODOLOGY OUTCOMES

Key takeaways from the IRM example. To summarize, the failures of OOD optimization can be attributed to: i) Using unrobust objectives for optimization; ii) Using unreliable scheme to approach the desired solution. Nevertheless, we can improve the robustness of the OOD objectives by introducing additional guidance such that the desired solution is relocated in the Pareto front w.r.t. the new objectives. After obtaining robust objectives to optimize, we then leverage a preference-aware MOO solver to find the Pareto optimal solutions that maximally satisfy the invariance constraints by assigning the OOD objective a higher preference while being aware of retaining ERM performance.

More formally, let  $f_{\mathrm{ood}}$  be the desired OOD solution and  $\mathcal{F}$  be the functional class of  $f_{\mathrm{ood}}$ , a group of OOD objectives  $L_{\mathrm{ood}} = \{\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ood}}^i\}_{i=1}^m$  are robust if their composite objective  $L_{\mathrm{ood}}$  satisfies that

$$
\boldsymbol {L} _ {\text {o o d}} (f _ {\text {o o d}}) \preceq \boldsymbol {L} _ {\text {o o d}} (f), \forall f \neq f _ {\text {o o d}} \in \mathcal {F}, \tag {8}
$$

When given a robust OOD objective  $L_{\mathrm{ood}}$ , our target is to solve the following MOO problem

$$
\min  _ {f} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {\text {E R M}}, L _ {\text {o o d}}\right) ^ {T}, \tag {9}
$$

where  $L_{\mathrm{ood}}$  corresponds to an  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ood}}$ -relaxed invariance constraint as  $L_{\mathrm{ood}}(f_{\mathrm{ood}}) = \epsilon_{\mathrm{ood}} \preceq L_{\mathrm{ood}}(f), \forall f \neq f_{\mathrm{ood}} \in \mathcal{F}$ . Denote the  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{inv}}$  as empirical loss of using the underlying invariant features to predict labels, then the optimal values of the desired OOD solution w.r.t. Eq. 9 are  $(\epsilon_{\mathrm{inv}}, \epsilon_{\mathrm{ood}})^T = (\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ERM}}(f_{\mathrm{ood}}), L_{\mathrm{ood}}(f_{\mathrm{ood}}))^T$ , which corresponds to an ideal preference (or OOD preference) for the objectives, that is  $\pmb{p}_{\mathrm{ood}} = (\epsilon_{\mathrm{inv}}^{-1}, \epsilon_{\mathrm{ood}}^{-1})^T$ . The optimal solutions of Eq. 9 that satisfy the exact Pareto optimality, i.e.,  $\pmb{p}_{\mathrm{ood}_i} \mathcal{L}_i = \pmb{p}_{\mathrm{ood}_j} \mathcal{L}_j, \forall \mathcal{L}_i, \mathcal{L}_j \in \mathcal{L}$ , are expected to recover  $f_{\mathrm{ood}}$  in Eq. 8.

PAIR-o as an optimizer for OOD generalization. To find a desired Pareto optimal solution specified by  $p_{\mathrm{ood}}$ , we adopt a 2-stage optimization scheme, which consists of two phases, i.e., the "descent" and the "balance" phase, following the common practice (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021).

In the "descent" phase, we train the model with the ERM loss such that it approaches the Pareto front by merely minimizing  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ERM}}$  first. Then, in the "balance" phase, we adjust the solution to maximally satisfy the exact Pareto optimality specified by  $p_{\mathrm{odd}}$ . We adopt the off-the-shelf preference-aware MOO solver EPO (Mahapatra & Rajan, 2020) to guide the descent in this phase. Specifically, at each step, we find an adjustment direction  $g_{b}$  according to the divergence of each objective from the preferred direction implied by  $p_{\mathrm{odd}}$ . Then, we will find an objective weight vector to reweight both the ERM and OOD objectives, such that the descent direction of the reweighted objective  $g_{\mathrm{dsc}}$  has a maximum angle with  $g_{b}$ . Meanwhile, to avoid divergence from the Pareto front,  $g_{\mathrm{dsc}}$  also needs to guarantee that it has a positive angle with the objective that diverges from the preferred direction most. We provide detailed descriptions and theoretical discussions of the algorithm in Appendix C.1.

PAIR-s for OOD model selection. Model selection in OOD generalization is known to be challenging, as the validation data used to evaluate the model performance is no longer necessarily identically distributed to the test data (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021). The IRM example also implies that the traditional model selection methods that merely depend on the validation performance, i.e., the ERM performance, can easily compromise OOD performance due to the conflicts with ERM objective, especially when the validation set has a large gap between the test set (cf. CMNIST in Table 3).

When given no additional assumption, we posit that the OOD loss values can serve as a proxy for OOD performance, which essentially corresponds to the underlying prior assumed in the OOD methods. It naturally resembles PAIR optimization therefore motivates PAIR-s. PAIR-s jointly considers and trades off the ERM and OOD performance in model selection, and select models that maximally satisfy the exact Pareto optimality. We leave more details and discussions in Appendix C.2.

# 4.2 THEORETICAL DISCUSSIONS AND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Essentially both PAIR-  $\circ$  and PAIR-s aim to solve Eq. 9 up to the exact Pareto optimality. However, in practice the ideal preference is usually unknown and the exact Pareto optimality could be too strict to achieve. In other words, PAIR-  $\circ$  and PAIR-s usually target at an approximated version of Eq. 9. Therefore, we develop an  $\epsilon$ -approximated formulation of Eq. 9, i.e.,  $|p_{\mathrm{odd}_i}\mathcal{L}_i - p_{\mathrm{odd}_j}\mathcal{L}_j|\leq \epsilon ,\forall \mathcal{L}_i,\mathcal{L}_j\in \mathcal{L}$ , which might be of independent interest. Built upon the relaxed variant, we analyze its empirical OOD generalization performance and prove the following Theorem in Appendix D.2.

Theorem 4.1. (Informal) For  $\gamma \in (0,1)$  and any  $\epsilon, \delta > 0$ , if  $\mathcal{F}$  is a finite hypothesis class, both ERM and OOD losses are bounded above, let  $I_{PAIR}$  be the index of all losses,  $p_{\max} \coloneqq \max_{i \in I_{PAIR}} p_i$  and  $L_{\max} \coloneqq \max_{i \in I_{PAIR}} L_i$ , if the number of training samples  $|D| \geq (32L_{\max}^2 p_{\max}^2 / \delta^2) \log [2(m + 1)|\mathcal{F}| / \gamma]$ , then with probability at least  $1 - \gamma$ , PAIR- $\sigma$  and PAIR- $s$  yield an  $\epsilon$ -approximated solution of  $f_{\text{ood}}$ .

Practical Considerations. Theorem 4.1 establishes the theoretical guarantee of PAIR-  $\circ$  and PAIR-s given only an imprecise OOD preference. Empirically, we find that assigning a large enough preference to the OOD objectives is generally sufficient for PAIR-  $\circ$  to find a desired OOD solution. For example, in most experiments PAIR-  $\circ$  yields a satisfactory OOD solution with a relative preference of (1, 1e10, 1e12) for ERM, IRMv1, and VREx. For PAIR-s, we can estimate

the empirical upper bounds of  $(\epsilon_{\mathrm{inv}},\epsilon_{\mathrm{odd}})$  from the running history and adjust OOD preference to be slightly larger. We provide a detailed discussion on the preference choice in practice in Appendix C.3.

Besides, the requirement of full gradients in PAIR-  $\circ$  can be a bottleneck when deployed to large models which has a prohibitively large number of parameters (Sener & Koltun, 2018). To this end, we can use only the gradients of classifier  $w$  to solve for the objective weights, or freeze the featurizer after the "descent" phase to further reduce the resource requirement (Zhang et al., 2022a). We discuss more practical options and how PAIR can be applied to other OOD methods in Appendix C.4.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

We conduct extensive experiments on COLOREDMNIST, WILDS and DOMAINBED to verify the effectiveness of PAIR-  $\mathbf{o}$  and PAIR-s in finding a better OOD solution under objective conflicts.

Proof of concept on COLOREDMNIST. In Table 1, we compare PAIR-  $\cdot \mathbb{O}$  implemented with IRMX to other strong baselines on COLOREDMNIST (CMNIST) and the failure case variant (Kamath et al., 2021) (CMNIST-m). We follow the evaluation setup as in IRM (Arjovsky et al., 2019) and report the results from 10 runs. We assign a relative preference (1,1e10,1e12) to ERM, IRMv1 and VREx objectives, respectively. It can be found that PAIR-  $\cdot \mathbb{O}$  significantly improves over IRMv1 across all environment settings, while IRMX using the linear weighting scheme performs worse than PAIR-  $\cdot \mathbb{O}$ , confirming

the effectiveness of PAIR-  $\circ$  . Interestingly, using only the gradients of the classifier  $w$  in PAIR-  $\circ$  can yield competitive performance as that uses  $f$  or  $\varphi$  , while the former has better scalability. Therefore, we will use PAIR-  $\circ_{w}$  in the following experiments. More details are given in Appendix E.1.

Can PAIR-  $\circ$  effectively find better OOD solutions under realistic distribution shifts? We evaluate PAIR-  $\circ$  implemented with IRMX on 6 challenging datasets from WILDS benchmark (Koh et al., 2021), and compare PAIR-  $\circ$  with other state-of-the-art OOD methods from different lines (Sec. 2), including CORAL (Sun & Saenko, 2016), GroupDRO (Sagawa* et al., 2020), IRM (Arjovsky et al., 2019), V-REx (Krueger et al., 2021), Fish (Shi et al., 2022) and an advanced importance-aware data augmentation method LISA (Yao et al., 2022). By default, we assign a relative preference (1, 1e10, 1e12) to ERM, IRMv1 and VREx objectives, respectively, and restrict the search space of the preference. Our implementation and evaluation protocol follow the exact configuration as previous works (Koh et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022). Details can be found in Appendix E.3.

Table 2 shows that PAIR-  $\circ$  substantially improves over IRMv1 as well as IRMX and yields top-ranking OOD performance among all state-of-the-art methods across different realistic distribution shifts, demonstrating the effectiveness and significance of resolving the optimization dilemma in OOD generalization. Besides, the advances of PAIR over IRMX also confirm the effectiveness of PAIR-  $\circ$  in finding a better trade-off between ERM and OOD objectives.

How can PAIR-o mitigate the objective conflicts? We conduct ablation studies with the modified COLOREDMNIST (More details and results are given in Appendix E.2). First, as shown in Fig. 5(a),

(d) Preference sensitivity.

PAIR-  $\circ$  effectively finds a better solution than exhaustive tuning of penalty weights in IRMX. That is because PAIR can adaptively adjust the penalty weights (Fig. 5(b)), which leads to a Pareto optimal solution that has lower OOD losses while not compromising the ERM loss too much (Fig. 5(c)). The other reason is that, PAIR-  $\circ$  is generally robust to different choices of preference choices (Fig. 5(d)), which makes it adaptable to various scenarios, confirming our discussions in Sec. 4.2.

Can PAIR-s effectively select better OOD solutions under realistic distribution shifts? To verify the effectiveness of PAIR-s, we apply PAIR-s to multiple representative OOD methods as discussed in Sec. 2, and examine whether PAIR-s can improve the model selections under rigorous hyperparameters tunning (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021) on COLOREDMNIST (Kamath et al., 2021), PACS (Li et al., 2017) and TERRAINCOGNITA (Beery et al., 2018). Intuitively, models selected merely based on ERM performance tend to have a high preference or better performance on environments that have a similar distribution of the corresponding validation set, which will lead to higher variance of performances at different environments or a lower worst environment performance. Hence we use training-domain validation accuracy for COLOREDMNIST and TERRAINCOGNITA, and test-domain validation accuracy for PACS to validate the existence of this issue under different scenarios (Teney et al., 2021). More details and results are provided in Appendix F.

†Using the training domain validation accuracy. ‡Using the test domain validation accuracy.

Table 3 shows that there is a high variance in the performances at different environments of the models selected only based on the validation accuracy. In contrast, by jointly considering and trading off the ERM and OOD performances in model selection, PAIR-S substantially mitigates the variance by improving the worst environment performance of all methods under all setups up to  $10\%$ . It could serve as strong evidence for the importance of considering ERM and OOD trade-offs.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this work, we provided a new understanding of optimization dilemma in OOD generalization from the MOO perspective, and attributed the failures of OOD optimization to the compromised robustness of relaxed OOD objectives and the unreliable optimization scheme. We highlighted the importance of trading off the ERM and OOD objectives and proposed a new optimizer PAIR-  $\mathbf{\Omega}_{\mathrm{o}}$  and a new model selection criteria PAIR-s to mitigate the dilemma. We provided extensive theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity and significance of properly handling the ERM and OOD trade-offs.
