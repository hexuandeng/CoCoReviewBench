# ABSTRACT

A determinantal point process (DPP) on a collection of  $M$  items is a model, parameterized by a symmetric kernel matrix, that assigns a probability to every subset of those items. Recent work shows that removing the kernel symmetry constraint, yielding nonsymmetric DPPs (NDPPs), can lead to significant predictive performance gains for machine learning applications. However, existing work leaves open the question of scalable NDPP sampling. There is only one known DPP sampling algorithm, based on Cholesky decomposition, that can directly apply to NDPPs as well. Unfortunately, its runtime is cubic in  $M$ , and thus does not scale to large item collections. In this work, we first note that this algorithm can be transformed into a linear-time one for kernels with low-rank structure. Furthermore, we develop a scalable sublinear-time rejection sampling algorithm by constructing a novel proposal distribution. Additionally, we show that imposing certain structural constraints on the NDPP kernel enables us to bound the rejection rate in a way that depends only on the kernel rank. In our experiments we compare the speed of all of these samplers for a variety of real-world tasks.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A determinantal point process (DPP) on  $M$  items is a model, parameterized by a symmetric kernel matrix, that assigns a probability to every subset of those items. DPPs have been applied to a wide range of machine learning tasks, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Zhang et al., 2017), reinforcement learning (Osogami & Raymond, 2019; Yang et al., 2020), text summarization (Dupuy & Bach, 2018), coresets (Tremblay et al., 2019), and more. However, a symmetric kernel can only capture negative correlations between items. Recent works (Brunel, 2018; Gartrell et al., 2019) have shown that using a nonsymmetric DPP (NDPP) allows modeling of positive correlations as well, which can lead to significant predictive performance gains. Gartrell et al. (2021) provides scalable NDPP kernel learning and MAP inference algorithms, but leaves open the question of scalable sampling. The only known sampling algorithm for NDPPs is the Cholesky-based approach described in Poulson (2019), which has a runtime of  $O(M^3)$  and thus does not scale to large item collections.

There is a rich body of work on efficient sampling algorithms for (symmetric) DPPs, including recent works such as Derezinski et al. (2019); Poulson (2019); Calandriello et al. (2020). Key distinctions between existing sampling algorithms include whether they are for exact or approximate sampling, whether they assume the DPP kernel has some low-rank  $K \ll M$ , and whether they sample from the space of all  $2^M$  subsets or from the restricted space of size-  $k$  subsets, so-called  $k$ -DPPs. In this work we focus on exact sampling for low-rank kernels, and provide scalable algorithms for NDPPs. Our contributions are as follows, with runtime and memory details summarized in Table 1:

- Linear-time sampling (Section 3): We show how to transform the  $O(M^3)$  Cholesky-decomposition-based sampler from Poulon (2019) into an  $O(MK^2)$  sampler for rank- $K$  kernels.  
- Sublinear-time sampling (Section 4): Using rejection sampling, we show how to leverage existing sublinear-time samplers for symmetric DPPs to implement a sublinear-time sampler for a subclass of NDPPs that we call orthogonal NDPPs (ONDPPs).  
- Learning with orthogonality constraints (Section 5): We show that the scalable NDPP kernel learning of Gartrell et al. (2021) can be slightly modified to impose an orthogonality constraint, yielding the ONDPP subclass. The constraint allows us to control the rejection sampling algorithm's

Table 1: Runtime and memory complexities for sampling algorithms developed in this work.  $M$  is the size of the entire item set (ground set), and  $K$  is the rank of the kernel (often  $K \ll  M$  in practice). We use  $k$  to represent the size of the sampled set (often  $k \ll  K$  in practice).  $\omega  \in  \left\lbrack  {0,1}\right\rbrack$  is a data-dependent constant (with our specific learning scheme,  $\omega  \ll  1$  ). The sublinear-time rejection algorithm includes a one-time preprocessing step, after which each successive sample only requires "sampling time".

rejection rate, ensuring its scalability. Experiments suggest that the predictive performance of the kernels is not degraded by this change.

For a common large-scale setting where  $M$  is 1 million, our sublinear-time sampler results in runtime that is hundreds of times faster than the linear-time sampler. In the same setting, our linear-time sampler provides runtime that is millions of times faster than the only previously known NDPP sampling algorithm, which has cubic time complexity and is thus impractical in this scenario.

# 2 BACKGROUND

Notation. We use  $[M] := \{1, \ldots, M\}$  to denote the set of items 1 through  $M$ . We use  $\mathbf{I}_K$  to denote the  $K$ -by- $K$  identity matrix, and often write  $\mathbf{I} := \mathbf{I}_M$  when the dimensionality should be clear from context. Given  $\mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times M}$ , we use  $\mathbf{L}_{i,j}$  to denote the entry in the  $i$ -th row and  $j$ -th column, and  $\mathbf{L}_{A,B} \in \mathbb{R}^{|A| \times |B|}$  for the submatrix formed by taking rows  $A$  and columns  $B$ . We also slightly abuse notation to denote principal submatrices with a single subscript,  $\mathbf{L}_A := \mathbf{L}_{A,A}$ .

Kernels. As discussed earlier, both (symmetric) DPPs and NDPPs define a probability distribution over all  $2^{M}$  subsets of a ground set  $[M]$ . The distribution is parameterized by a kernel matrix  $\pmb{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times M}$  and the probability of a subset  $Y \subseteq [M]$  is defined to be  $\operatorname*{Pr}(Y) \propto \det(\pmb{L}_Y)$ . For this to define a valid distribution, it must be the case that  $\det(\pmb{L}_Y) \geq 0$  for all  $Y$ . For symmetric DPPs, the non-negativity requirement is identical to a requirement that  $\pmb{L}$  be positive semi-definite (PSD). For nonsymmetric DPPs, there is no such simple correspondence, but prior work such as Gartrell et al. (2019; 2021) has focused on PSD matrices for simplicity.

Normalizing and marginalizing. The normalizer of a DPP or NDPP distribution can also be written as a single determinant:  $\sum_{Y\subseteq [M]}\operatorname *{det}(L_Y) = \operatorname *{det}(L + I)$  (Kulesza & Taskar, 2012, Theorem 2.1). Additionally, the marginal probability of a subset can be written as a determinant:  $\operatorname *{Pr}(A\subseteq Y) =$ $\operatorname *{det}(K_A)$ , for  $K\coloneqq I - (L + I)^{-1}$  (Kulesza & Taskar, 2012, Theorem 2.2)*, where  $K$  is typically called the marginal kernel.

Intuition. The diagonal element  $K_{i,i}$  is the probability that item  $i$  is included in a set sampled from the model. The 2-by-2 determinant  $\operatorname{det}(K_{\{i,j\}}) = K_{i,i}K_{j,j} - K_{i,j}K_{j,j}$  is the probability that both  $i$  and  $j$  are included in the sample. A symmetric DPP has a symmetric marginal kernel, meaning  $K_{i,j} = K_{j,i}$ , and hence  $K_{i,i}K_{j,j} - K_{i,j}K_{j,i} \leq K_{i,i}K_{j,j}$ . This implies that the probability of including both  $i$  and  $j$  in the sampled set cannot be greater than the product of their individual inclusion probabilities. Hence, symmetric DPPs can only encode negative correlations. In contrast, NDPPs can have  $K_{i,j}$  and  $K_{j,i}$  with differing signs, allowing them to also capture positive correlations.

# 2.1 RELATED WORK

Learning. Gartrell et al. (2021) proposes a low-rank kernel decomposition for NDPPs that admits linear-time learning. The decomposition takes the form  $\pmb{L} \coloneqq \pmb{V}\pmb{V}^{\top} + \pmb{B}(\pmb{D} - \pmb{D}^{\top})\pmb{B}^{\top}$  for  $\pmb{V}, \pmb{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times K}$ , and  $\pmb{D} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K}$ . The  $\pmb{V}\pmb{V}^{\top}$  component is a rank- $K$  symmetric matrix, which can model negative correlations between items. The  $\pmb{B}(\pmb{D} - \pmb{D}^{\top})\pmb{B}^{\top}$  component is a rank- $K$  skew-

symmetric matrix, which can model positive correlations between items. For compactness of notation, we will write  $\pmb{L} = \pmb{Z}\pmb{X}\pmb{Z}^{\top}$ , where  $\pmb{Z} = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\pmb{V} & \pmb{B} \end{array} \right] \in \mathbb{R}^{M\times 2K}$ , and  $\pmb{X} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}\pmb{I}_K & \pmb{0}\\ \pmb{0} & \pmb{D} - \pmb{D}^\top \end{array} \right] \in \mathbb{R}^{2K\times 2K}$ . The marginal kernel in this case also has a rank-2K decomposition, as can be shown via application of the Woodbury matrix identity:

$$
\boldsymbol {K} := \boldsymbol {I} - (\boldsymbol {I} + \boldsymbol {L}) ^ {- 1} = \boldsymbol {Z} \boldsymbol {X} \left(\boldsymbol {I} _ {2 K} + \boldsymbol {Z} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {Z} \boldsymbol {X}\right) ^ {- 1} \boldsymbol {Z} ^ {\top}. \tag {1}
$$

Note that the matrix to be inverted can be computed from  $\mathbf{Z}$  and  $\mathbf{X}$  in  $O(MK^2)$  time, and the inverse itself takes  $O(K^3)$  time. Thus,  $\mathbf{K}$  can be computed from  $\mathbf{L}$  in time  $O(MK^2)$ . We will develop sampling algorithms for this decomposition, as well as an orthogonality-constrained version of it. We use  $\mathbf{W} := \mathbf{X}\left(\mathbf{I}_{2K} + \mathbf{Z}^\top\mathbf{Z}\mathbf{X}\right)^{-1}$  in what follows so that we can compactly write  $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{W}\mathbf{Z}^\top$ .

Sampling. While there are a number of exact sampling algorithms for DPPs with symmetric kernels, the only published algorithm that clearly can directly apply to NDPPs is from Poulon (2019) (see Theorem 2 therein). This algorithm begins with an empty set  $Y = \emptyset$  and iterates through the  $M$  items, deciding for each whether or not to include it in  $Y$  based on all of the previous inclusion/exclusion decisions. Poulon (2019) shows, via the Cholesky decomposition, that the necessary conditional probabilities can be computed as follows:

$$
\Pr \left(\{i \} \subseteq Y \mid \{j \} \subseteq Y\right) = \boldsymbol {K} _ {i, i} - \left(\boldsymbol {K} _ {i, j} \boldsymbol {K} _ {j, i}\right) / \boldsymbol {K} _ {j, j}, \tag {2}
$$

$$
\Pr \left(\{i \} \subseteq Y \mid \{j \} \not \subseteq Y\right) = \mathbf {K} _ {i, i} - \left(\mathbf {K} _ {i, j} \mathbf {K} _ {j, i}\right) / \left(\mathbf {K} _ {j, j} - 1\right). \tag {3}
$$

Algorithm 1 (left-hand side) gives pseudocode for this Cholesky-based sampling.

There has also been some recent work on approximate sampling for fixed-size  $k$ -NDPPs: Alimoham-madi et al. (2021) provide a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and prove that the overall runtime to approximate  $\varepsilon$ -close total variation distance is bounded by  $O(M^2 k^3 \log(1 / (\varepsilon \operatorname*{Pr}(Y_0))))$ , where  $\operatorname*{Pr}(Y_0)$  is probability of an initial state  $Y_0$ . Improving this runtime is an interesting avenue for future work, but for this paper we focus on exact sampling.

# 3 LINEAR-TIME CHOLESKY-BASED SAMPLING

In this section, we show that the  $O(M^3)$  runtime of the Cholesky-based sampler from Poulson (2019) can be significantly improved when using the low-rank kernel decomposition of Gartrell et al. (2021). First, note that Line 8 of Algorithm 1, where all marginal probabilities are updated via an  $(M - i)$ -by-  $(M - i)$  matrix subtraction, is the most costly part of the algorithm, making overall time and memory complexity  $O(M^3)$  and  $O(M^2)$ , respectively. However, when the DPP kernel is given by a low-rank decomposition, we observe that marginal probabilities can be updated by matrix-vector multiplications of dimension  $2K$ , regardless of  $M$ . In more detail, suppose we have the marginal kernel  $K = ZWZ^\top$  as in Eq. (1). Then, for  $i \neq j$ :

$$
\Pr \left(\{j \} \subseteq Y \mid \{i \} \subseteq Y\right) = \boldsymbol {K} _ {j, j} - \boldsymbol {K} _ {j, i} \boldsymbol {K} _ {i, i} ^ {- 1} \boldsymbol {K} _ {i, j} = \boldsymbol {z} _ {j} ^ {\top} \left(\boldsymbol {W} - \frac {\left(\boldsymbol {W} \boldsymbol {z} _ {i}\right) \left(\boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {W}\right)}{\boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {W} \boldsymbol {z} _ {i}}\right) \boldsymbol {z} _ {j}, \tag {4}
$$

$$
\Pr \left(\{j \} \subseteq Y \mid \{i \} \not \subseteq Y\right) = z _ {j} ^ {\top} \left(\boldsymbol {W} - \frac {\left(\boldsymbol {W} \boldsymbol {z} _ {i}\right) \left(\boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {W}\right)}{\boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {W} \boldsymbol {z} _ {i} - 1}\right) \boldsymbol {z} _ {j}. \tag {5}
$$

The conditional probabilities in Eqs. (4) and (5) are of bilinear form, and the  $z_{j}$  do not change during sampling. Hence, it is enough to update the  $2K$ -by-  $2K$  inner matrix at each iteration, and obtain the marginal probability by multiplying this matrix by  $z_{i}$ . The details are shown on the right-hand side of Algorithm 1. The overall time and memory complexity are  $O(MK^2)$  and  $O(MK)$ , respectively.

# 4 SUBLINEAR-TIME REJECTION SAMPLING

Although the Cholesky-based sampler runs in time linear in  $M$ , even this is too expensive for the large  $M$  that are often encountered in real-world datasets. To improve runtime, we consider rejection sampling (Von Neumann, 1963). Let  $p$  be the target distribution that we aim to sample, and let  $q$  be any distribution whose support corresponds to that of  $p$ ; we call  $q$  the proposal distribution. Assume that there is a universal constant  $U$  such that  $p(x) \leq Uq(x)$  for all  $x$ . In this setting, rejection sampling draws a sample  $x$  from  $q$  and accepts it with probability  $p(x) / (Uq(x))$ , repeating until an acceptance occurs. The distribution of the resulting samples is  $p$ . It is important to choose a good proposal distribution  $q$  so that sampling is efficient and the number of rejections is small.

# 4.1 PROPOSAL DPP CONSTRUCTION

Our first goal is to find a proposal DPP with symmetric kernel  $\widehat{L}$  that can upper bound all probabilities of samples from the NDPP with kernel  $L$  within a constant factor. To this end, we expand the determinant of a principal submatrix,  $\operatorname*{det}(L_Y)$ , using the spectral decomposition of the NDPP kernel. Such a decomposition essentially amounts to combining the eigendecomposition of the symmetric part of  $L$  with the Youla decomposition (Youla, 1961) of the skew-symmetric part.

Specifically, suppose  $\{(\rho_i,\pmb {v}_i)\}_{i = 1}^K$  is the eigendecomposition of  $\pmb {V}\pmb{V}^{\top}$  and  $\{(\sigma_j,\pmb {y}_{2j - 1},\pmb {y}_{2j})\}_{j = 1}^{K / 2}$  is the Youla decomposition of  $\pmb {B}(\pmb {D} - \pmb{D}^{\top})\pmb{B}^{\top}$  (see Appendix D for more details). That is,

$$
\boldsymbol {B} (\boldsymbol {D} - \boldsymbol {D} ^ {\top}) \boldsymbol {B} ^ {\top} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {K / 2} \sigma_ {j} \left(\boldsymbol {y} _ {2 j - 1} \boldsymbol {y} _ {2 j} ^ {\top} - \boldsymbol {y} _ {2 j} \boldsymbol {y} _ {2 j - 1} ^ {\top}\right). \tag {6}
$$

Then we can simply write  $\pmb {L} = \pmb {Z}\pmb {X}\pmb{Z}^{\top}$  , for  $\pmb {Z}\coloneqq [v_{1},\dots ,v_{K},y_{1},\dots ,y_{K}]\in \mathbb{R}^{M\times 2K}$  , and

$$
\boldsymbol {X} := \operatorname {d i a g} \left(\rho_ {1}, \dots , \rho_ {K}, \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & \sigma_ {1} \\ - \sigma_ {1} & 0 \end{array} \right], \dots , \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & \sigma_ {K / 2} \\ - \sigma_ {K / 2} & 0 \end{array} \right]\right). \tag {7}
$$

Now, consider defining a related but symmetric PSD kernel  $\widehat{\pmb{L}}\coloneqq \pmb {Z}\widehat{\pmb{X}}\pmb{Z}^{\top}$  with  $\widehat{\pmb{X}}\coloneqq$  diag  $(\rho_{1},\ldots ,\rho_{K},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{1},\ldots ,\sigma_{K / 2},\sigma_{K / 2})$  . All determinants of the principal submatrices of  $\widehat{L} =$ $\pmb {Z}\widehat{\pmb{X}}\pmb{Z}^{\top}$  upper bound those of  $L$  , as stated below.

Theorem 1. For every subset  $Y \subseteq [M]$ , it holds that  $\operatorname{det}(\mathbf{L}_Y) \leq \operatorname{det}(\widehat{\mathbf{L}}_Y)$ . Moreover, equality holds when the size of  $Y$  is equal to the rank of  $\mathbf{L}$ .

Proof sketch: From the Cauchy-Binet formula, the determinants of  $L_{Y}$  and  $\widehat{L}_Y$  for all  $Y \subseteq [M]$ ,  $|Y| \leq 2K$  can be represented as

$$
\det  \left(\boldsymbol {L} _ {Y}\right) = \sum_ {I \subseteq [ K ], | I | = | Y |} \sum_ {J \subseteq [ K ], | J | = | Y |} \det  \left(\boldsymbol {X} _ {I, J}\right) \det  \left(\boldsymbol {Z} _ {Y, I}\right) \det  \left(\boldsymbol {Z} _ {Y, J}\right), \tag {8}
$$

$$
\det  (\widehat {\boldsymbol {L}} _ {Y}) = \sum_ {I \subseteq [ 2 K ], | I | = | Y |} \det  (\widehat {\boldsymbol {X}} _ {I}) \det  (\boldsymbol {Z} _ {Y, I}) ^ {2}. \tag {9}
$$

Many of the terms in Eq. (8) are actually zero due to the block-diagonal structure of  $\mathbf{X}$ . For example, note that if  $1 \in I$  but  $1 \notin J$ , then there is an all-zeros row in  $\mathbf{X}_{I,J}$ , making  $\operatorname*{det}(\mathbf{X}_{I,J}) = 0$ . We show that each  $\mathbf{X}_{I,J}$  with nonzero determinant is a block-diagonal matrix with diagonal entries among  $\rho_i, \pm \sigma_j$ , or  $\left[ \begin{array}{cc}0 & \sigma_j \\ -\sigma_j & 0 \end{array} \right]$ . With this observation, we can prove that  $\operatorname*{det}(\mathbf{X}_{I,J})$  is upper-bounded by  $\operatorname*{det}(\widehat{\mathbf{X}}_I)$  or  $\operatorname*{det}(\widehat{\mathbf{X}}_J)$ . Then, through application of the rearrangement inequality, we can upper-bound the sum of the  $\operatorname*{det}(\mathbf{X}_{I,J}) \operatorname*{det}(\mathbf{Z}_Y,I) \operatorname*{det}(\mathbf{Z}_Y,J)$  in Eq. (8) with a sum over  $\operatorname*{det}(\widehat{\mathbf{X}}_I) \operatorname*{det}(\mathbf{Z}_Y,I)^2$ . Finally, we show that the number of non-zero terms in Eq. (8) is identical to the number of non-zero terms in Eq. (9). Combining these gives us the desired inequality  $\operatorname*{det}(\mathbf{L}_Y) \leq \operatorname*{det}(\widehat{\mathbf{L}}_Y)$ . The full proof of Theorem 1 is in Appendix E.1.

Now, recall that the normalizer of a DPP (or NDPP) with kernel  $\pmb{L}$  is  $\operatorname*{det}(\pmb{L} + \pmb{I})$ . The ratio of probability of the NDPP with kernel  $\pmb{L}$  to that of a DPP with kernel  $\widehat{\pmb{L}}$  is thus:

$$
\frac {\operatorname * {P r} _ {\boldsymbol {L}} (Y)}{\operatorname * {P r} _ {\widehat {\boldsymbol {L}}} (Y)} = \frac {\det  (\boldsymbol {L} _ {Y}) / \det  (\boldsymbol {L} + \boldsymbol {I})}{\det  (\widehat {\boldsymbol {L}} _ {Y}) / \det  (\widehat {\boldsymbol {L}} + \boldsymbol {I})} \leq \frac {\det  (\widehat {\boldsymbol {L}} + \boldsymbol {I})}{\det  (\boldsymbol {L} + \boldsymbol {I})},
$$

where the inequality follows from Theorem 1. This gives us the necessary universal constant  $U$  upper-bounding the ratio of the target distribution to the proposal distribution. Hence, given a sample  $Y$  drawn from the DPP with kernel  $\widehat{L}$ , we can use acceptance probability  $\operatorname*{Pr}_{\mathbf{L}}(Y) / (U\operatorname*{Pr}_{\widehat{\mathbf{L}}}(\mathbf{Y})) = \det(L_{Y}) / \det(\widehat{\mathbf{L}}_{Y})$ . Pseudo-codes for proposal construction and rejection sampling are given in Algorithm 2. Note that to derive  $\widehat{L}$  from  $L$  it suffices to run the Youla decomposition of  $B(D - D^{\top})B^{\top}$ , because the difference is only in the skew-symmetric part. This decomposition can run in  $O(MK^{2})$  time; more details are provided in Appendix D. Since  $\widehat{L}$  is a symmetric PSD matrix, we can apply existing fast DPP sampling algorithms to sample from it. In particular, in the next section we combine a fast tree-based method with rejection sampling.

# 4.2 SUBLINEAR-TIME TREE-BASED SAMPLING

There are several DPP sampling algorithms that run in sublinear time, such as Gillenwater et al. (2019) and Derezinski et al. (2019). Here, we consider applying the former, a tree-based approach, to sample from the proposal distribution defined by  $\widehat{\pmb{L}}$ . We give some details of the sampling procedure, as in the course of applying it we discovered an optimization that slightly improves on the runtime of prior work. Formally, let  $\{(\lambda_i,z_i)\}_{i = 1}^{2K}$  be the eigendecomposition of  $\widehat{\pmb{L}}$  and define  $Z\coloneqq [z_{1},\ldots ,z_{2K}]\in \mathbb{R}^{M\times 2K}$ . As shown in Kulesza & Taskar (2012, Lemma 2.6) the determinant of  $\widehat{\pmb{L}}_Y$  for every  $Y\subseteq [M]$  can be written:

$$
\frac {\det (\widehat {\boldsymbol {L}} _ {Y})}{\det (\widehat {\boldsymbol {L}} + \boldsymbol {I})} = \sum_ {I \subseteq [ 2 K ], | E | = | Y |} \det (\boldsymbol {Z} _ {Y, E} \boldsymbol {Z} _ {Y, E} ^ {\top}) \prod_ {i \in E} \frac {\lambda_ {i}}{\lambda_ {i} + 1} \prod_ {i \notin E} \frac {1}{\lambda_ {i} + 1}. \tag {10}
$$

A matrix of the form  $Z_{:,E}Z_{:,E}^{\top}$  has exactly  $|E|$  eigenvalues with value 1 and all others have value 0. This is typically called an elementary DPP. Hence, Eq. (10) can be thought of as a way of writing DPP probabilities as a mixture of elementary DPPs. Based on this mixture view, DPP sampling can be done in two steps: (1) choose an elementary DPP according to its mixture weight, and then (2) sample a subset from the selected elementary DPP. The key idea of tree-based sampling is that step (2) can be accelerated by traversing a binary tree structure, that can be done in time logarithmic in  $M$ .

More specifically, given marginal kernel  $\pmb{K} = \pmb{Z}_{:,E}\pmb{Z}_{:,E}^{\top}$ , where  $E$  is obtained from step (1), we start from the empty set  $Y = \emptyset$  and repeatedly add an item  $j$  to  $Y$  with probability:

$$
\Pr (j \in S \mid Y \subseteq S) = \boldsymbol {K} _ {j, j} - \boldsymbol {K} _ {j, Y} \left(\boldsymbol {K} _ {Y}\right) ^ {- 1} \boldsymbol {K} _ {Y, j} = \boldsymbol {Z} _ {j, E} \boldsymbol {Q} ^ {Y} \boldsymbol {Z} _ {j, E} ^ {\top} = \left\langle \boldsymbol {Q} ^ {Y}, \left(\boldsymbol {Z} _ {j,:} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {Z} _ {j,:}\right) _ {E} \right\rangle , \tag {11}
$$

where  $S$  is some final selected subset, and  $\pmb{Q}^{Y} := \pmb{I}_{|E|} - \pmb{Z}_{Y,E}^{\top}\left(\pmb{Z}_{Y,E}\pmb{Z}_{Y,E}^{\top}\right)^{-1}\pmb{Z}_{Y,E}$ . Suppose that a node in the tree contains a subset  $A = A_{\ell} \cup A_{r}$ , such that  $A_{\ell} \cap A_{r} = \emptyset$  and stores  $\sum_{j \in A} \pmb{Z}_{j,\cdot}^{\top} \pmb{Z}_{j,\cdot}$ . Then, one can sample a single item by recursively moving down to the left node with probability:

$$
p _ {\ell} = \frac {\left\langle \boldsymbol {Q} ^ {Y} , \sum_ {j \in A _ {\ell}} \left(\boldsymbol {Z} _ {j : :} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {Z} _ {j : :}\right) _ {E} \right\rangle}{\left\langle \boldsymbol {Q} ^ {Y} , \sum_ {j \in A} \left(\boldsymbol {Z} _ {j : :} \boldsymbol {Z} _ {j : :} ^ {\top}\right) _ {E} \right\rangle}, \tag {12}
$$

or to the right node with probability  $1 - p_{\ell}$ , until reaching a leaf node. One can also build a binary tree using all eigenvectors  $Z$ , and then take  $|E|$ -by-  $|E|$  submatrices of it during the sampling stage. Full descriptions of tree construction and sampling are provided in Algorithm 3. The proposed tree-based rejection sampling for an NDPP is outlined on the right-side of Algorithm 2. The one-time preprocessing step of constructing the tree (CONSTRUCTTREE) requires  $O(MK^2)$  time. The time required for sampling (after pre-processing) is given by Proposition 1; see Appendix E.2 for a proof.

Proposition 1. The tree-based sampling procedure SAMPLEDPP in Algorithm 3 runs in time  $O(K + k^3 \log M + k^4)$ , where  $k$  is the size of the sampled set.

# 4.3 AVERAGE NUMBER OF REJECTIONS

We now return to rejection sampling and focus on the expected number of rejections. The number of rejections of Algorithm 2 is known to be a geometric random variable with mean equal to the constant  $U$  used to upper-bound the ratio of the target distribution to the proposal distribution:  $\operatorname*{det}(\widehat{\pmb{L}} +\pmb {I}) / \operatorname*{det}(\pmb {L} + \pmb {I})$ . If all columns in  $V$  and  $B$  are orthogonal, which we denote  $V\perp B$ , then the expected number of rejections depends only on the eigenvalues of the skew-symmetric part of the NDPP kernel.

Theorem 2. Given an NDPP kernel  $\pmb{L} = \pmb{V}\pmb{V}^{\top} + \pmb{B}(\pmb{D} - \pmb{D}^{\top})\pmb{B}^{\top}$  for  $\pmb{V},\pmb{B}\in \mathbb{R}^{M\times K},\pmb{D}\in \mathbb{R}^{K\times K}$ , consider the proposal kernel  $\widehat{\pmb{L}}$  as proposed in Section 4.1. Let  $\{\sigma_j\}_{j = 1}^{K / 2}$  be the positive eigenvalues obtained from the Youla decomposition of  $\pmb {B}(\pmb {D} - \pmb {D}^{\top})\pmb{B}^{\top}$ . If  $\pmb {V}\perp \pmb{B}$ , then  $\frac{\operatorname*{det}(\widehat{\pmb{L}} + \pmb{I})}{\operatorname*{det}(\pmb{L} + \pmb{I})} = \prod_{j = 1}^{K / 2}\left(1 + \frac{2\sigma_j}{\sigma_j^2 + 1}\right)\leq (1 + \omega)^{K / 2}$ , where  $\omega = \frac{2}{K}\sum_{j = 1}^{K / 2}\frac{2\sigma_j}{\sigma_j^2 + 1}\in (0,1]$ .

Proof sketch: Orthogonality between  $\mathbf{V}$  and  $\mathbf{B}$  allows  $\operatorname*{det}(\mathbf{L} + \mathbf{I})$  to be expressed just in terms of the eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{V}\mathbf{V}^{\top}$  and  $B(D - D^{\top})B^{\top}$ . Since both  $\mathbf{L}$  and  $\widehat{\mathbf{L}}$  share the symmetric part  $\mathbf{V}\mathbf{V}^{\top}$ , the ratio of determinants only depends on the skew-symmetric part. A more formal proof appears in Appendix E.1.

Assuming we have a kernel where  $V \perp B$ , we can combine Theorem 2 with the tree-based rejection sampling algorithm (right-side in Algorithm 2) to sample in time  $O((K + k^3 \log M + k^4)(1 + \omega)^{K/2})$ . Hence, we have a sampling algorithm that is sublinear in  $M$ , and can be much faster than the Cholesky-based algorithm when  $(1 + \omega)^{K/2} \ll M$ . In the next section, we introduce a learning scheme with the  $V \perp B$  constraint, as well as regularization to ensure that  $\omega$  is small.

# 5 LEARNING WITH ORTHOGONALITY CONSTRAINTS

We aim to learn a NDPP that provides both good predictive performance and a low rejection rate. We parameterize our NDPP kernel matrix  $\pmb{L} = \pmb{V}\pmb{V}^{\top} + \pmb{B}(\pmb{D} - \pmb{D}^{\top})\pmb{B}^{\top}$  by

$$
\boldsymbol {D} = \operatorname {d i a g} \left(\left[ \begin{array}{l l} 0 & \sigma_ {1} \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right], \dots , \left[ \begin{array}{l l} 0 & \sigma_ {K / 2} \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right]\right) \tag {13}
$$

for  $\sigma_{j} \geq 0$ ,  $B^{\top} B = I$ , and, motivated by Theorem 2, require  $V^{\top} B = 0^{\S}$ . We call such orthogonality-constrained NDPPs "ONDPPs". Notice that if  $V \not\perp B$ , then  $L$  will have rank  $< 2K$ , meaning part of the rank-2K available for modeling goes unused. Thus, this constraint can also be thought of as simply ensuring that ONDPPs use the full rank available to them.

Given example subsets  $\{Y_1,\dots ,Y_n\}$  as training data, learning is done by minimizing the regularized negative log-likelihood:

$$
\min  _ {\boldsymbol {V}, \boldsymbol {B}, \left\{\sigma_ {j} \right\} _ {j = 1} ^ {K / 2}} - \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \log \left(\frac {\operatorname* {d e t} \left(\boldsymbol {L} _ {Y _ {i}}\right)}{\operatorname* {d e t} (\boldsymbol {L} + \boldsymbol {I})}\right) + \alpha \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} \frac {\| \boldsymbol {v} _ {i} \| _ {2} ^ {2}}{\mu_ {i}} + \beta \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} \frac {\| \boldsymbol {b} _ {i} \| _ {2} ^ {2}}{\mu_ {i}} + \gamma \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {K / 2} \log \left(1 + \frac {2 \sigma_ {j}}{\sigma_ {j} ^ {2} + 1}\right) \tag {14}
$$

where  $\alpha, \beta, \gamma > 0$  are hyperparameters,  $\mu_{i}$  is the frequency of item  $i$  in the training data, and  $\boldsymbol{v}_{i}$  and  $\boldsymbol{b}_{i}$  represent the rows of  $\boldsymbol{V}$  and  $\boldsymbol{B}$ , respectively. This objective is very similar to that of Gartrell et al. (2021), except for the orthogonality constraint and the final regularization term. Note that this regularization term corresponds exactly to the logarithm of the average rejection rate, and therefore should help to control the number of rejections.

# 6 EXPERIMENTS

We first show that the orthogonality constraint from Section 5 does not degrade the predictive performance of learned kernels. We then compare the speed of our proposed sampling algorithms.

# 6.1 PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE RESULTS FOR NDPP LEARNING

We benchmark various DPP models, including symmetric (Gartrell et al., 2017), nonsymmetric for scalable learning (Gartrell et al., 2021), as well as our ONDPP kernels with and without rejection rate regularization. We use the scalable NDPP models (Gartrell et al., 2021) as a baseline. The kernel

components of each model are learned using five real-world recommendation datasets, which have ground set sizes that range from 3,941 to 1,059,437 items (see Appendix A for more details).

Our experimental setup and metrics mirror those of Gartrell et al. (2021). We report the mean percentile rank (MPR) metric for a next-item prediction task, the AUC metric for subset discrimination, and the log-likelihood of the test set; see Appendix B for more details on the experiments and metrics. For all metrics, higher numbers are better. For NDPP models, we additionally report the average rejection rates when they apply to rejection sampling.

In Table 2, we observe that the predictive performance of our ONDPP models generally match or sometimes exceed the baseline. This is likely because the orthogonality constraint enables more effective use of the full rank-  $2K$  feature space. Moreover, imposing the regularization on rejection rate, as shown in Eq. (14), often leads to dramatically smaller rejection rates, while the impact on predictive performance is generally marginal. These results justify the ONDPP and regularization for fast sampling. Finally, we observe that the learning time of our ONDPP models is typically a bit longer than that of the NDPP models, but still quite reasonable (e.g., the time per iteration for the NDPP takes 27 seconds for the Book dataset, while our ONDPP takes 49.7 seconds).

Fig. 1 shows how the regularizer  $\gamma$  affects the test log-likelihood and the average number of rejections. We see that  $\gamma$  degrades predictive performance and reduces the rejection rate when set above a certain threshold; this behavior is seen for many datasets. However, for the Recipe dataset we observed that the test log-likelihood is not very sensitive to  $\gamma$ , likely because all models in our experiments achieve very high performance on this dataset. In general, we observe that  $\gamma$  can be set to a value that results in a small rejection rate, while having minimal impact on predictive performance.

# 6.2 SAMPLING TIME COMPARISON

We benchmark the Cholesky-based sampling algorithm (Algorithm 1) and tree-based rejection sampling algorithm (Algorithm 2) on ONDPPs with both synthetic and real-world data.

Synthetic datasets. We generate non-uniform random features for  $V, B$  as done by (Han & Gillen-water, 2020). In particular, we first sample  $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{100}$  from  $\mathcal{N}(0, I_{2K} / (2K))$ , and integers  $t_{1}, \ldots, t_{100}$  from Poisson distribution with mean 5, rescaling the integers such that  $\sum_{i} t_{i} = M$ . Next, we draw  $t_{i}$  random vectors from  $\mathcal{N}(x_{i}, I_{2K})$ , and assign the first  $K$ -dimensional vectors as the row vectors of  $V$  and the latter vectors as those of  $B$ . Each entry of  $D$  is sampled from  $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ . We choose  $K = 100$  and vary  $M$  from  $2^{12}$  to  $2^{20}$ .

(a)  
Fig. 2(a) illustrates the runtimes of Algorithms 1 and 2. We verify that the rejection sampling time tends to increase sub-linearly with the ground set size  $M$ , while the Cholesky-based sampler runs in linear time. In Fig. 2(b), the runtimes of the preprocessing steps for Algorithm 2 (i.e., spectral decomposition and tree construction) are reported. Although the rejection sampler requires these additional processes, they are one-time steps and run much faster than a single run of the Cholesky-based method for  $M = 2^{20}$ .

Real-world datasets. In Table 3, we report the runtimes and speedup of NDPP sampling algorithms for real-world datasets. All NDPP kernels are obtained using learning with orthogonality constraints, with rejection rate regularization as reported in Section 6.1. We observe that the tree-based rejection sampling runs up to 246 times faster than the Cholesky-based algorithm. For larger datasets, we expect that this gap would significantly increase. As with the synthetic experiments, we see that the tree construction pre-processing time is comparable to the time required to draw a single sample via the other methods, and thus the tree-based method is often the best choice for repeated sampling $^{\parallel}$ .

# 7 CONCLUSION

In this work we developed scalable sampling methods for NDPPs. One limitation of our rejection sampler is its practical restriction to the ONDPP subclass. Other opportunities for future work include the extension of our rejection sampling approach to the generation of fixed-size samples (from  $k$ -NDPPs), the development of approximate sampling techniques, and the extension of DPP samplers along the lines of Derezinski et al. (2019); Calandriello et al. (2020) to NDPPs. Scalable sampling also opens the door to using NDPPs as building blocks in probabilistic models.
