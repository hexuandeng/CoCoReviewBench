# ABSTRACT

Despite the growing interest in continual learning, most of its contemporary works have been studied in a rather restricted setting where tasks are clearly distinguishable and task boundaries are known during training. However, if our goal is to develop an algorithm that learns as humans do, this setting is far from realistic and it is essential to develop a methodology that works in a task-free manner. Meanwhile, among several branches of continual learning, expansion-based methods have the advantage of eliminating catastrophic forgetting by allocating new resource to learn new data. In this work, we propose an expansion-based approach for task-free continual learning for the first time. Our model, named Continual Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture (CN-DPM), consists of a set of neural network experts that are in charge of a subset of the data. CN-DPM expands the number of experts in a principled way under the Bayesian nonparametric framework. With extensive experiments, we show that our model successfully performs task-free continual learning for both discriminative and generative tasks such as image classification and image generation.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Humans consistently encounter new information throughout their lifetime. The way the information is provided, however, is vastly different from that of conventional machine learning where each minibatch is iid-sampled from the whole dataset. Data points adjacent in time can be highly correlated and the overall distribution of the data can shift drastically as the training progresses. Continual learning (CL) aims at imitating incredible human's ability of learning from a non-iid stream of data without catastrophically forgetting the previously learned knowledge.

Most CL approaches (Aljundi et al., 2018; 2017; Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Rusu et al., 2016; Shin et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2018) assume that the data stream is explicitly divided into a sequence of tasks that are known at training time. Since this assumption is far from realistic, task-free CL is more practical and demanding but has been largely understudied with only few exceptions of (Aljundi et al., 2019a;b). In this general CL, not only is explicit task definition unavailable but also the data distribution gradually shifts without clear task boundary.

Meanwhile, existing CL methods can be classified into three different categories (Parisi et al., 2019): regularization, replay, and expansion methods. Regularization and replay approaches address the catastrophic forgetting by regularizing the update of a specific set of weights or replaying the previously seen data, respectively. On the other hand, the expansion methods are different from the two approaches in that it can expand the model architecture to accommodate new data instead of fixing it beforehand. Therefore, the expansion methods can bypass catastrophic forgetting by preventing pre-existing components from being overwritten by the new information. The key limitation of prior expansion methods, however, is that the decisions of when to expand and which resource to use heavily rely on explicitly given task definition and heuristics.

In this work, our goal is to propose a novel expansion-based approach for task-free CL which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been discussed yet. Inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) (Jacobs et al., 1991), our model consists of a set of experts, each of which is in charge of a subset of the data in a stream. The model expansion (i.e. adding more experts) is governed by the Bayesian nonparametric framework, which determines the model complexity by the data, as opposed to the parametric methods that fix the model complexity before training. We formulate the task-free CL

as an online variational inference of Dirichlet process mixture models consisting of a set of neural experts; thus we name our approach as the Continual Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture (CN-DPM) model.

We highlight the key contributions of this work as follows.

- We are the first to propose an expansion-based approach for task-free CL. Hence, our model not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also is applicable to the setting where no task definition and boundaries are given at both training and test time. Our model named CN-DPM consists of a set of neural network experts, which are expanded in a principled way built up on the Bayesian nonparametrics that have not been adopted in general CL research.  
- Our model can deal with both generative and discriminative tasks of CL. With several benchmark experiments of CL literature on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR 10/100, we show that our model successfully performs multiple types of CL tasks including image classification and generation.

# 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

# 2.1 CONTINUAL LEARNING

Parisi et al. (2019) classify CL approaches into three branches: regularization (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Aljundi et al., 2018), replay (Shin et al., 2017) and expansion (Aljundi et al., 2017; Rusu et al., 2016; Yoon et al., 2018) methods. Regularization and replay approaches fix the model architecture before training, and prevent catastrophic forgetting by regularizing the change of a specific set of weights or replaying previously learned data. Hybrids of replay and regularization also exist such as Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2019a). On the other hand, methods based on expansion add new network components to learn new data. Conceptually, such direction has the following advantages compared to the first two: (i) catastrophic forgetting can be eliminated since new information is not overwritten on pre-existing components and (ii) the model capacity is determined adaptively depending on the data.

Task-Free Continual Learning. All the works mentioned above heavily rely on explicit task definition. However, in real-world scenarios, task definition is rarely given at training time. Moreover, the data domain may gradually shift without any clear task boundary. Despite its importance, task-free CL has been largely understudied; to the best of our knowledge, there are only two works (Aljundi et al., 2019a;b), each based on regularization and replay. Specifically, Aljundi et al. (2019a) extend MAS (Aljundi et al., 2018) by adding heuristics to determine when to update the importance weights with no task definition. In their following work (Aljundi et al., 2019b), they improve the memory management algorithm of GEM (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017) such that the memory elements are carefully selected to minimize catastrophic forgetting. Compared to the previous research, our work is the first to propose an expansion-based task-free CL method.

# 2.2 DIRICHLET PROCESS MIXTURE MODELS

We briefly review the Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model (Antoniak, 1974; Ferguson, 1983) and a variational method to approximate the posterior of DPM models in an online setting: Sequential Variational Approximation (SVA) (Lin, 2013). For a more detailed review, refer to Appendix A.

Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM). The DPM model is often applied to clustering problems where the number of clusters is not known in advance. The generative process of a DPM model is

$$
x _ {n} \sim p (x; \theta_ {n}), \quad \theta_ {n} \sim G, \quad G \sim \mathrm {D P} (\alpha , G _ {0}), \tag {1}
$$

where  $x_{n}$  is the  $n$ -th data, and  $\theta_{n}$  is the  $n$ -th latent variable sampled from  $G$ , which itself is a distribution sampled from a Dirichlet process (DP). The DP is parameterized by a concentration parameter  $\alpha$  and a base distribution  $G_{0}$ . Since  $G$  is discrete with probability 1 (Teh, 2010), same values can be sampled multiple times for  $\theta$ . If  $\theta_{n} = \theta_{m}$ , the two data points  $x_{n}$  and  $x_{m}$  belong to the same cluster. An alternative formulation uses the variable  $z_{n}$  that indicates to which cluster the  $n$ -th data belongs such that  $\theta_{n} = \phi_{z_{n}}$  where  $\phi_{k}$  is the parameter of  $k$ -th cluster. In the context of this paper,  $\phi_{k}$  refers to the parameters of  $k$ -th expert.

Approximation of Posterior of DPM Models. Since the exact inference of the posterior of DPM models is infeasible, approximate inference methods are applied. Among many approximation methods, we adopt the Sequential Variational Approximation (SVA) (Lin, 2013). While the data is given one by one, SVA sequentially determines  $\rho_{n}$  and  $\nu_{k}$  which are the variational approximation for the distribution of  $z_{n}$  and  $\phi_{k}$  respectively. Since  $\rho_{n}$  satisfies  $\sum_{k}\rho_{n,k} = 1$  and  $\rho_{n,k} >= 0$ ,  $\rho_{n,k}$  can be interpreted as the probability of  $n$ -th data belonging to  $k$ -th cluster and is often called responsibility.  $\rho_{n+1}$  and  $\nu^{(n+1)}$  at step  $n+1$  are computed as:

$$
\rho_ {n + 1, k} \propto \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \rho_ {i, k}\right) \int_ {\phi} p \left(x _ {n + 1} \mid \phi\right) \nu_ {k} ^ {(n)} (d \phi) & \text {i f} 1 \leq k \leq K \\ \alpha \int_ {\phi} p \left(x _ {n + 1} \mid \phi\right) G _ {0} (d \phi) & \text {i f} k = K + 1 \end{array} , \right. \tag {2}
$$

$$
\nu_ {k} ^ {(n + 1)} (d \phi) \propto \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} G _ {0} (d \phi) \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {n + 1} p \left(x _ {i} \mid \phi\right) ^ {\rho_ {i, k}} & \text {i f} 1 \leq k \leq K \\ G _ {0} (d \phi) p \left(x _ {n + 1} \mid \phi\right) ^ {\rho_ {n + 1, k}} & \text {i f} k = K + 1 \end{array} . \right. \tag {3}
$$

In practice, SVA adds a new component only when  $\rho_{K + 1}$  is greater than a certain threshold  $\epsilon$ . If  $G_0$  and  $p(x_i|\phi)$  are not a conjugate pair, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is used to find the MAP estimation  $\hat{\phi}$  with a learning rate of  $\lambda$  instead of calculating the whole distribution  $\nu_k$ :

$$
\hat {\phi} _ {k} ^ {(n + 1)} \leftarrow \hat {\phi} _ {k} ^ {(n)} + \lambda \left(\nabla_ {\hat {\phi} _ {k} ^ {(n)}} \log G _ {0} \left(\hat {\phi} _ {k} ^ {(n)}\right) + \nabla_ {\hat {\phi} _ {k} ^ {(n)}} \log p \left(x \mid \hat {\phi} _ {k} ^ {(n)}\right)\right). \tag {4}
$$

DPM for Discriminative Tasks. DPM can be extended to discriminative tasks where each data point is an input-output pair  $(x, y)$  and the goal is to learn the conditional distribution  $p(y|x)$ . To use DPM, which is a generative model, for discriminative tasks, we first learn the joint distribution  $p(x, y)$  and induce the conditional distribution from it:  $p(y|x) = p(x, y) / \int_y p(x, y)$ . The joint distribution modeled by each component can be decomposed as  $p(x, y|z) = p(y|x, z)p(x|z)$  (Rasmussen & Ghahramani, 2002; Shahbaba & Neal, 2009).

DPM in Meta-Learning. Recent works (Jerfel et al., 2018; Nagabandi et al., 2019) in online meta-learning use DPM models to add new components without supervision. Their approach, however, lacks a generative component which is a crucial element to complete the DPM formulation. As a consequence, it is hard to extend their methods beyond meta-learning. In contrast, our method implements a sound DPM model and is applicable to general CL.

# 3 APPROACH

We aim at general task-free CL where the number of tasks and task description are not available at both training and test time. We even consider the case where the data stream cannot be split into separate tasks in Appendix F. All of the existing expansion methods are not task-free since they require task definition at training (Aljundi et al., 2017) or even at test time (Rusu et al., 2016; Xu & Zhu, 2018; Li et al., 2019). We propose a novel expansion method that automatically determines when to expand and which component to use. We first deal with generative tasks and generalize into discriminative ones.

# 3.1 CONTINUAL LEARNING AS MODELING OF THE MIXTURE DISTRIBUTION

We can formulate a CL scenario as a stream of data involving different tasks  $\mathcal{D}_1, \mathcal{D}_2, \ldots$  where each task  $\mathcal{D}_k$  is a set of data sampled from a (possibly) distinct distribution  $p(x|z = k)$ . If  $K$  tasks are given so far, the overall distribution is expressed as the mixture distribution:

$$
p (x) = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} p (x | z = k) p (z = k), \tag {5}
$$

where  $p(z = k)$  can be approximated by  $N_{k} / N$  where  $N_{k} = |\mathcal{D}_{k}|$  and  $N = \sum_{k}N_{k}$ . The goal of CL is to learn the mixture distribution in an online manner. Regularization and replay methods directly model the approximate distribution  $p(x;\phi)$  parameterized by a single component  $\phi$  and update it to fit the overall distribution  $p(x)$ . When updating  $\phi$ , however, they do not have full access to all the previous data, and thus the information of previous tasks is at risk of being lost as more tasks are learned. Another way to solve CL is to use a mixture model: approximating each  $p(x|z = k)$

with  $p(x; \phi_k)$ . If we learn a new task distribution  $p(x|z = K + 1)$  with new parameter  $\phi_{K + 1}$  and leave the existing parameters intact, we can preserve the knowledge of the previous tasks. The expansion-based CL methods follow this idea.

Similarly, in the discriminative task, the goal of CL is to model the overall conditional distribution which is a mixture of task-wise conditional distribution  $p(y|x,z = k)$ :

$$
p (y | x) = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} p (y | x, z = k) p (z = k | x). \tag {6}
$$

Prior expansion methods use expert networks each of which models a task-wise conditional distribution  $p(y|x;\phi_k)^1$ . However, a new problem arises in expansion methods: choosing the right expert given  $x$ , i.e.  $p(z|x)$  in Eq.(6). Existing methods simply assume that explicit task descriptor  $z$  is given, which is generally not true in human-like learning scenarios. That is, we need a gating mechanism that can infer  $p(z|x)$  only from  $x$  (i.e. which expert should process  $x$ ). With the gating, the model prediction naturally reduces to the sum of expert outputs weighted by the gate values, which is the mixture of experts (MoE) (Jacobs et al., 1991) formulation:  $p(y|x)\approx \sum_{k}p(y|x;\phi_{k})p(z = k|x)$ .

However, it is not possible to use a single gate network as in Shazeer et al. (2017) to model  $p(z|x)$  in CL; since the gate network is a classifier that finds the correct expert for a given data, training it in an online setting causes catastrophic forgetting. Thus, one possible solution to replace a gating network is to couple each expert  $k$  with a generative model that represents  $p(x|z = k)$  as in Rasmussen & Ghahramani (2002) and Shahbaba & Neal (2009). As a result, we can build a gating mechanism without catastrophic forgetting as

$$
p (y | x) \approx \sum_ {k} p (y | x; \phi_ {k} ^ {D}) p (z = k | x) \approx \sum_ {k} p (y | x; \phi_ {k} ^ {D}) \frac {p \left(x ; \phi_ {k} ^ {G}\right) p \left(z = k\right)}{\sum_ {k ^ {\prime}} p \left(x ; \phi_ {k ^ {\prime}} ^ {G}\right) p \left(z = k ^ {\prime}\right)}, \tag {7}
$$

where  $p(z = k) \approx N_k / N$ . We also differentiate the notation for the parameters of discriminative models for classification and generative models for gating by the superscript  $D$  and  $G$ .

If we know the true assignment of  $z$ , which is the case of task-based CL, we can independently train a discriminative model (i.e.  $p(y|x;\phi_k^D)$ ) and a generative model (i.e.  $p(x;\phi_k^G)$ ) for each task  $k$ . In task-free CL, however,  $z$  is unknown so the model needs to infer the posterior  $p(z|x,y)$ . Even worse, the total number of experts is unknown beforehand. Therefore, we propose to employ a Bayesian nonparametric framework, specifically the Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model, which can fit a mixture distribution with no prefixed number of components. We use SVA described in section 2.2 to approximate the posterior in an online setting. Although SVA is originally designed for the generative tasks, it is easily applicable to discriminative tasks by making each component  $k$  to model  $p(x,y|z) = p(y|x,z)p(x|z)$ .

# 3.2 THE CONTINUAL NEURAL DIRICHLET PROCESS MIXTURE (CN-DPM) MODEL

The proposed approach for task-free CL, named Continual Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture (CN-DPM) model, consists of a set of experts, each of which is associated with a discriminative model (classifier) and a generative model (density estimator). More specifically, the classifier models  $p(y|x,z = k)$ , for which we can adopt any classifier or regressor using deep neural networks, and the density estimator describes the marginal likelihood  $p(x|z = k)$ , for which we can use any explicit density model such as VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and PixelRNN (Oord et al., 2016). We respectively denote the classifier and the density estimator of expert  $k$  as  $p(y|x;\phi_k^D)$  and  $p(x;\phi_k^G)$ , where  $\phi_k^D$  and  $\phi_k^G$  are the parameters of the models. Finally, the prediction  $p(y|x)$  can be obtained from Eq.(7) by plugging in the output of the classifier and the density estimator. Note that the number of experts is not pre-fixed but expanded via the DPM framework. Figure 1 illustrates the overall training and inference process of our model.

Training. We assume that a sequence of samples arrive one at a time during training. For a new sample, we first decide whether the sample should be assigned to an existing expert or a new expert should be created for it. Suppose that samples up to  $(x_{n},y_{n})$  are sequentially processed and  $K$

![](images/19c5c93de932edfa2f3268f36f21ec6cee3429ca8b3a800966c100ecadff8381.jpg)  
Figure 1: Overview of our CN-DPM model. Each expert  $k$  (blue boxes) contains a discriminative component for modeling  $p(y|x;\phi_k^D)$  and a generative component for modeling  $p(x;\phi_k^G)$ , jointly representing  $p(x,y;\phi_k)$ . We also keep the assigned data count  $N_{k}$  per expert. (a) During training, each sample  $(x,y)$  coming in sequence is evaluated by every expert to calculate the responsibility  $\rho_{k}$  of each expert. If  $\rho_{K + 1}$  is high enough, i.e. none of the existing experts is responsible, the data is stored into short-term memory (STM). Otherwise, it is learned by the corresponding expert. When STM is full, a new expert is created from the data in STM. (b) Since CN-DPM is a generative model, we first compute the joint distribution  $p(x,y)$  for a given  $x$ , from which it is trivial to infer  $p(y|x)$ .

![](images/024c117b7d395864461925d4213f9657c492ecedbe4c6b46c6440b4df518e5fe.jpg)

experts are already created when a new sample  $(x_{n + 1},y_{n + 1})$  arrives. We compute the responsibility  $\rho_{n + 1,k}$  as follows:

$$
\rho_ {n + 1, k} \propto \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \rho_ {i, k}\right) p \left(y _ {n + 1} \mid x _ {n + 1}; \hat {\phi} _ {k} ^ {D}\right) p \left(x _ {n + 1}; \hat {\phi} _ {k} ^ {G}\right) & \text {i f} 1 \leq k \leq K \\ \alpha p \left(y _ {n + 1} \mid x _ {n + 1}; \hat {\phi} _ {0} ^ {D}\right) p \left(x _ {n + 1}; \hat {\phi} _ {0} ^ {G}\right) \text {w h e r e} \hat {\phi} _ {0} \sim G _ {0} (\phi) & \text {i f} k = K + 1 \end{array} \right. \tag {8}
$$

where  $G_{0}$  is a distribution corresponding to the weight initialization. If  $\arg \max_k \rho_{n+1,k} \neq K + 1$ , the sample is assigned to the existing experts proportional to  $\rho_{n+1,k}$ , and the parameters of the experts are updated with the new sample by Eq.(4) such that  $\hat{\phi}_k$  is the MAP approximation given the data assigned up to the current time step. Otherwise, we create a new expert.

Short-Term Memory. However, it is not a good idea to create a new expert immediately and initialize it to be the MAP estimation given  $x_{n+1}$ . Since both classifier and density estimator of an expert are neural networks, training the new expert with only a single example leads to severe overfitting. To mitigate this issue, we employ short-term memory (STM) to collect sufficient data before creating a new expert. When a data point is classified as new, we store it to the STM. Once the STM reaches its maximum capacity  $M$ , we stop the data inflow for a while and train a new expert with the data in the STM for multiple epochs until convergence. We call this procedure sleep phase. After sleep, the STM is emptied and the newly trained expert is added to the expert pool. During the subsequent wake phase, the expert is learned from the data assigned to it. This STM trick assumes that the data in the STM belong to the same expert. We empirically find that this assumption is acceptable in many CL settings where adjacent data are highly correlated. The overall training procedure is described in Algorithm 1. Note that we use  $\rho_{n,0}$  instead of  $\rho_{n,K+1}$  in the algorithm for brevity.

Inference. At test time, we infer  $p(y|x)$  from the collaboration of the learned experts as in Eq.(7).

Techniques for Practicality. Naively adding a new expert has two major problems: (i) the number of parameters grows unnecessarily large as the experts redundantly learn common features and (ii) there is no positive transfer of knowledge between experts. Therefore, we propose a simple method to share parameters between experts. When creating a new expert, we add lateral connections to the features of the previous experts similar to Rusu et al. (2016). To prevent catastrophic forgetting in the existing experts, we block the gradient from the new expert. In this way, we can greatly reduce the number of parameters while allowing positive knowledge transfer. More techniques such as sparse regularization in Yoon et al. (2018) can be employed to further reduce redundant parameters. As they are orthogonal to our approach, we do not use such techniques in our experiments. Another effective technique that we use in the classification experiments is adding a temperature parameter to

the classifier. Since the range of  $\log p(x|z)$  is far broader than  $\log p(y|x,z)$ , the classifier has almost no effect without proper scaling. Thus, we can increase overall accuracy by adjusting the relative importances of images and labels. We also introduce an algorithm to prune redundant experts in Appendix D, and discuss further practical issues of CN-DPM in Appendix B.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate the proposed CN-DPM model in task-free CL with four benchmark datasets. Appendices include more detailed model architecture, additional experiments and analyses.

# 4.1 CONTINUAL LEARNING SCENARIOS

A CL scenario defines a sequence of tasks where the data distribution for each task is assumed to be different from others. Below we describe the task-free CL scenarios used in the experiments. At both train and test time, the model cannot access the task information. Unless stated otherwise, each task is presented for a single epoch (i.e. a complete online setting) with a batch size of 10.

Split-MNIST (Zenke et al., 2017). The MNIST dataset (LeCun et al., 1998) is split into five tasks, each containing approximately  $12\mathrm{K}$  images of two classes, namely  $(0/1, 2/3, 4/5, 6/7, 8/9)$ . We conduct both classification and generation experiments in this scenario.

MNIST-SVHN (Shin et al., 2017). It is a two-stage scenario where the first consists of MNIST and the second contains SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011). This scenario is different from Split-MNIST; in Split-MNIST, new classes are introduced when transitioning into a new task, whereas the two stages in MNIST-SVHN share the same set of class labels and have different input domains.

Split-CIFAR10 and Split-CIFAR100. In Split-CIFAR10, we split CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) into five tasks in the same manner as Split-MNIST. For Split-CIFAR100, we build 20 tasks each containing 5 classes according to the pre-defined superclasses in CIFAR100. The training sets of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 consist of 50K examples each. To the best of our knowledge, we are first to report Split-CIFAR100 performance without using task information at test time. In Split-CIFAR100 experiments of all previous works (Rebuffi et al., 2017; Zenke et al., 2017; Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Aljundi et al., 2019c; Chaudhry et al., 2019a) a distinct output head is used for each task, and the task information to select the corresponding output head is given at both training and test time. Knowing the right output head, however, the task reduces to 5-way classification. Therefore, our setting is far more difficult than the prior works since the model has to perform 100-way classification only from the given input.

iid-offline and iid-online. iid-offline shows the maximum performance achieved by combining standard training techniques such as data augmentation, learning rate decay, multiple iteration (up to 100 epochs), and larger batch size. iid-online is the model trained with the same number of epoch and batch size with other CL baselines.

Fine-tune. As a popular baseline in the previous works, the base model is naively trained as data enters.

Reservoir. As Chaudhry et al. (2019b) show that simple experience replay (ER) can outperform most CL methods, we test ER with reservoir sampling as a strong baseline. Reservoir sampling randomly chooses a fixed amount of samples with a uniform probability from an indefinitely long stream of data, and thus it is suitable for managing the replay memory in task-free CL. At each training step, the model is trained using a mini-batch from the data stream and another one of the same size from the memory.

Gradient-Based Sample Selection (GSS). Aljundi et al. (2019b) propose a sampling method called GSS that diversifies the gradients of the samples in the replay memory. Since it is designed to work in task-free settings, we report the scores in their paper for comparison.

# 4.3 MODEL ARCHITECTURE

Split-MNIST. Following Hsu et al. (2018), we use a simple two-hidden-layer MLP classifier with ReLU activation as the base model for classification. The dimension of each layer is 400. For generation experiments, we use VAE whose encoder and decoder have the same hidden layer configuration with the classifier. Each expert in CN-DPM has the similar classifier and VAE with smaller

hidden dimensions. The first expert starts with 64 hidden units per layer, and add 16 units when a new expert is added. For classification, we adjust hyperparameter  $\alpha$  such that 5 experts are created. For generation, we set  $\alpha$  to produce 12 experts since more experts produce better score. We set the memory size in both Reservoir and CN-DPM to 500 for classification and 1000 for generation.

MNIST-SVHN and Split-CIFAR10/100. We use ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) as the base model. In CN-DPM, we use a 10-layer ResNet for the classifier and a CNN-based VAE. The encoder and the decoder of VAE have two CONV layers and two FC layers. We set  $\alpha$  such that 2, 5, and 20 experts are created for each scenario. The memory sizes in Reservoir, GSS and CN-DPM are set to 500 for MNIST-SVHN and 1000 for Split-CIFAR10/100. More details can be found in Appendix C.

# 4.4 RESULTS OF TASK-FREE CONTINUAL LEARNING

All reported numbers in our experiments are the average of 10 runs. Table 1 and 2 show our main experimental results. In every setting, CN-DPM outperforms the baselines by significant margins with reasonable parameter usage. Table 2 and Figure 2 shows the results of Split-CIFAR10 experiments. Since Aljundi et al. (2019b) test GSS using only 10K examples of CIFAR10, which is 1/5 of the whole train set, we follow their setting (denoted by 0.2 Epoch) for fair comparison. We also test a Split-CIFAR10 variant where each task is presented for 10 epochs. The accuracy and the training graph of GSS are excerpted from the original paper where the accuracy is the average of three runs and the graph is from one of the runs. In Figure 2, the bold line represents the average of 10 runs (except GSS which is a single run), and the faint lines are the individual runs. Surprisingly, Reservoir even surpasses the accuracy of GSS and proves to be a simple but powerful CL method.

One interesting observation in Table 2 is that the performance of Reservoir degrades as each task is extended up to 10 epochs. This is due to the nature of replay methods; since the same samples are replayed repeatedly as representatives of the previous tasks, the model tends to be overfitted to the replay memory as training continues. This degradation is more severe when the memory size is small as presented in Appendix I. Our CN-DPM, on the other hand, uses the memory to temporarily buffer recent examples, so there is no such overfitting problem. This is also confirmed by the CN-DPM's accuracy consistently increasing as learning progresses.

In addition, CN-DPM is particularly strong compared to other baselines when the number of tasks increases. For example, Reservoir, which performs reasonably well in other tasks, scores poorly in Split-CIFAR100, which involves 20 tasks and 100 classes. Even with the large replay memory of size 1000, the Reservoir suffers from the shortage of memory (e.g. only 50 slots per task). In contrast, CN-DPM's accuracy is more than double of Reservoir and comparable to that of iid-online.

Table 3 analyzes the accuracy of CN-DPM in Split-CIFAR10/100. We assess the performance and the amount of forgetting of individual components. We compute the test accuracy of the task at the end of each task using only the classifier of the responsible expert as Classifier (init). We also report the accuracy of each classifier after learning all tasks as Classifier (final). With little difference between the two scores, we can see that forgetting barely occurs in the classifiers. In addition, we report the gating accuracy at the end of training as  $VAE$ , which is the accuracy of task identification performed jointly by the VAEs. Overall, CN-DPM does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting which is a major problem in regularization and replay methods. As a trade-off, however, choosing the right expert arises as another problem in CN-DPM. Nonetheless, the results show that this new direction is especially promising when the number of tasks is very large.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this work, we formulated expansion-based task-free CL as learning of a Dirichlet process mixture model with neural experts. We demonstrated that the proposed CN-DPM model achieves great performance in multiple task-free settings, better than the existing methods. We believe there are several interesting research directions beyond this work: (i) improving the accuracy of expert selection, which is the main bottleneck of our method, and (ii) applying our method to different domains such as natural language processing and reinforcement learning.
