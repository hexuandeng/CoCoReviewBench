# ABSTRACT

We propose a probabilistic shape completion method extended to the continuous geometry of large-scale 3D scenes. Real-world scans of 3D scenes suffer from a considerable amount of missing data cluttered with unsegmented objects. The problem of shape completion is inherently ill-posed, and high-quality result requires scalable solutions that consider multiple possible outcomes. We employ the Generative Cellular Automata that learns the multi-modal distribution and transform the formulation to process large-scale continuous geometry. The local continuous shape is incrementally generated as a sparse voxel embedding, which contains the latent code for each occupied cell. We formally derive that our training objective for the sparse voxel embedding maximizes the variational lower bound of the complete shape distribution and therefore our progressive generation constitutes a valid generative model. Experiments show that our model successfully generates diverse plausible scenes faithful to the input, especially when the input data suffers from a significant amount of missing data and previous approaches fail. We also demonstrate that our approach outperforms deterministic models even for input data with a relatively small level of incompleteness, which verifies that probabilistic formulation is crucial for high-quality geometry completion.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

High-quality 3D data can create realistic virtual 3D environments or provide crucial information to interact with the environment for robots or human users (Varley et al. (2017)). However, 3D data acquired from a real-world scan is often noisy and incomplete with irregular samples. The task of 3D shape completion aims to recover the complete surface geometry from the raw 3D scans. Shape completion is often formulated in a data-driven way using the prior distribution of 3D geometry, which often results in multiple plausible outcomes given incomplete and noisy observation. If one learns to regress a single shape out of multi-modal shape distribution, one is bound to lose fine details of the geometry and produce blurry outputs as noticed with general generative models (Goodfellow (2017)). If we extend the range of completion to the scale of scenes with multiple objects, the task becomes even more challenging with the memory and computation requirements for representing large-scale high resolution 3D shapes.

In this work, we present continuous Generative Cellular Automata (cGCA), which generates multiple continuous surfaces for 3D reconstruction. Our work builds on Generative Cellular Automata (GCA) (Zhang et al. (2021)), which produces diverse shapes by progressively growing the object surface from the immediate neighbors of the input shape. cGCA inherits the multi-modal and scalable generation of GCA, but overcomes the limitation of discrete voxel resolution producing high-quality continuous surfaces. Specifically, our model learns to generate diverse sparse voxels associated with their local latent codes, namely sparse voxel embedding, where each latent code encodes the deep implicit fields of continuous geometry near each of the occupied voxels (Chabra et al. (2020); Jiang et al. (2020)). Our training objective maximizes the variational lower bound for the log-likelihood of the surface distribution represented with sparse voxel embedding. The stochastic formulation is modified from the original GCA, and theoretically justified as a sound generative model.

We demonstrate that cGCA can faithfully generate multiple plausible solutions of shape completion even for large-scale scenes with a significant amount of missing data as shown in Figure 1. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle the challenging task of probabilistic scene completion, which requires not only the model to generate multiple plausible outcomes but also be scalable enough to capture the wide-range context of multiple objects.

We summarize the key contributions as follows: (1) We are the first to tackle the problem of probabilistic scene completion with partial scans, and provide a scalable model that can capture the large-scale context of scenes. (2) We present continuous Generative Cellular Automata, a generative model that produces diverse continuous surfaces from a partial observation. (3) We modify infusion training (Bordes et al. (2017)) and prove that the formulation indeed increases the variational lower bound of data distribution, which verifies that the proposed progressive generation is a valid generative model.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES: GENERATIVE CELLULAR AUTOMATA

Continuous Generative Cellular Automata (cGCA) extends the idea of Generative Cellular Automata (GCA) by Zhang et al. (2021) but generates continuous surface with implicit representation instead of discrete voxel grid. For the completeness of discussion, we briefly review the formulation of GCA.

Starting from an incomplete voxelized shape, GCA progressively updates the local neighborhood of current occupied voxels to eventually generate a complete shape. In GCA, a shape is represented as a state  $s = \{(c, o_c) | o_c \in \{0, 1\}, c \in \mathbb{Z}^3\}$ , a set of binary occupancy  $o_c$  for every cell  $c \in \mathbb{Z}^3$ , where the occupancy grid stores only the sparse cells on the surface. Given a state of an incomplete shape  $s^0$ , GCA evolves to the state of a complete shape  $s^T$  by sampling  $s^{1:T}$  from the Markov chain

$$
s ^ {t + 1} \sim p _ {\theta} (\cdot | s ^ {t}), \tag {1}
$$

where  $T$  is a fixed number of transitions and  $p_{\theta}$  is a homogeneous transition kernel parameterized by neural network parameters  $\theta$ . The transition kernel  $p_{\theta}$  is implemented with sparse CNN (Graham et al. (2018); Choy et al. (2019)), which is a highly efficient neural network architecture that computes the convolution operation only on the occupied voxels.

The progressive generation of GCA confines the search space of each transition kernel at the immediate neighborhood of the current state. The occupancy probability within the neighborhood is regressed following Bernoulli distribution, and then the subsequent state is independently sampled for individual cells. With the restricted domain for probability estimation, the model is scalable to high resolution 3D voxel space. GCA shows that the series of local growth near sparse occupied cells can eventually complete the shape as a unified structure since the shapes are continuous and connected. While GCA is a scalable solution for generating diverse shapes, the grid representation for the 3D geometry inherently limits the resolution of the final shape.

# 3 CONTINUOUS GENERATIVE CELLULAR AUTOMATA

In Sec. 3.1, we formally introduce an extension of sparse occupancy voxels to represent continuous geometry named sparse voxel embedding, where each occupied voxel contains latent code representing local implicit fields. We train an autoencoder that can compress the implicit fields into the embeddings and vice versa. Then we present the sampling procedure of cGCA that generates 3D shape in Sec. 3.2, which is the inference step for shape completion. Sec. 3.3 shows the training objective of cGCA, which approximately maximizes the variational lower bound for the distribution of the complete continuous geometry.

Figure 2: Overview of our method. The implicit function of continuous shape can be encoded as sparse voxel embedding  $s$  and decoded back (left). The colors in the sparse voxel embedding represent the clustered labels of latent code  $z_{c}$  for each cell  $c$ . The sampling procedure of cGCA (right) involves  $T$  steps of sampling the stochastic transition kernel  $p_{\theta}$ , followed by  $T'$  mode seeking steps which remove cells with low probability. From the final sparse voxel embedding  $s^{T + T'}$ , the decoder can recover the implicit representation for the complete continuous shape.

# 3.1 SPARSE VOXEL EMBEDDING

In addition to the sparse occupied voxels of GCA, the state of cGCA, named sparse voxel embedding, contains the associated latent code, which can be decoded into continuous surface. Formally, the state  $s$  of cGCA is defined as a set of pair of binary occupancy  $o_c$  and the latent code  $z_c$ , for the cells  $c$  in a three-dimensional grid  $\mathbb{Z}^3$

$$
s = \left\{\left(c, o _ {c}, z _ {c}\right) \mid o _ {c} \in \{0, 1 \}, z _ {c} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {K}, c \in \mathbb {Z} ^ {3} \right\}. \tag {2}
$$

Similar to GCA, cGCA maintains the representation sparse by storing only the set of occupied voxels and their latent codes, and sets  $z_{c} = 0$  if  $o_{c} = 0$ .

The sparse voxel embedding  $s$  can be converted to and from the implicit representation of local geometry with neural networks, inspired by the work of Songyou et al. (2020), Chabra et al. (2020), and Chibane et al. (2020a). We utilize the (signed) distance to the surface as the implicit representation, and use autoencoder for the conversion. The encoder  $g_{\phi}$  produces the sparse voxel embedding  $s$  from the coordinate-distance pairs  $P = \{(p, d_p) | p \in \mathbb{R}^3, d_p \in \mathbb{R}\}$ , where  $p$  is a 3D coordinate and  $d_p$  is the distance to the surface,  $s = g_{\phi}(P)$ . The decoder  $f_{\omega}$ , on the other hand, regresses the local implicit field value  $d_q$  at the 3D position  $q \in \mathbb{R}^3$  given the sparse voxel embedding  $s$ ,  $d_q = f_{\omega}(s, q)$ . The detailed architecture of the autoencoder is described in Appendix A. An example of the conversion is presented on the left side of Fig. 2, where the color of the sparse voxel embedding represents clustered labels of the latent codes with k-means clustering (Hartigan & Wong (1979)). Note that the embedding of a similar local geometry, such as the seat of the chair, exhibits similar values of latent codes.

The parameters  $\phi, \omega$  of the autoencoder are jointly optimized by minimizing the following loss function:

$$
\mathcal {L} (\phi , \omega) = \frac {1}{| Q |} \sum_ {q \in Q} | f _ {\omega} (s, q) - \max  \left(\min  \left(\frac {d _ {q}}{\epsilon}, 1\right), - 1\right) | + \beta \frac {1}{| s |} \sum_ {c \in s} \| z _ {c} \|, \tag {3}
$$

where  $s = g_{\phi}(P)$  and  $\epsilon$  is the size of a single voxel. The first term in Eq. (3) corresponds to minimizing the normalized distance and the second is the regularization term for the latent code weighted by hyperparameter  $\beta$ . Clamping the maximum distance makes the network focus on predicting accurate values at the vicinity of the surface (Park et al. (2019); Chibane et al. (2020b)).

# 3.2 SAMPLING FROM CONTINUOUS GENERATIVE CELLULAR AUTOMATA

The generation process of cGCA echos the formulation of GCA (Zhang et al. (2021)), and repeats  $T$  steps of sampling from the transition kernel to progressively grow the shape. Each transition kernel  $p(s^{t + 1}|s^t)$  is factorized into cells within the local neighborhood of the occupied cells of the current

state,  $\mathcal{N}(s^t) = \{c' \in \mathbb{Z}^3 \mid d(c, c') \leq r, c \in s^t\}$  given a distance metric  $d$  and the radius  $r$ :

$$
p \left(s ^ {t + 1} \mid s ^ {t}\right) = \prod_ {c \in \mathcal {N} \left(s ^ {t}\right)} p _ {\theta} \left(o _ {c}, z _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}\right) = \prod_ {c \in \mathcal {N} \left(s ^ {t}\right)} p _ {\theta} \left(o _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}\right) p _ {\theta} \left(z _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}, o _ {c}\right). \tag {4}
$$

Note that the distribution is further decomposed into the occupancy  $o_{c}$  and the latent code  $z_{c}$ , where we denote  $o_{c}$  and  $z_{c}$  as the random variable of occupancy and latent code for cell  $c$  in state  $s^{t + 1}$ . Therefore the shape is generated by progressively sampling the occupancy and the latent codes for the occupied voxels which are decoded and fused into a continuous geometry. The binary occupancy is represented with the Bernoulli distribution

$$
p _ {\theta} \left(o _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}\right) = B e r \left(\lambda_ {\theta , c}\right), \tag {5}
$$

where  $\lambda_{\theta, c} \in [0, 1]$  is the estimated occupancy probability at the corresponding cell  $c$ . With our sparse representation, the distribution of the latent codes is

$$
p _ {\theta} \left(z _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}, o _ {c}\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \delta_ {0} & \text {i f} o _ {c} = 0 \\ N \left(\mu_ {\theta , c}, \sigma^ {t} \boldsymbol {I}\right) & \text {i f} o _ {c} = 1. \end{array} \right. \tag {6}
$$

$\delta_0$  is a Dirac delta distribution at 0 indicating that  $z_{c} = 0$  when  $o_c = 0$ . For the occupied voxels  $(o_c = 1)$ ,  $z_{c}$  follows the normal distribution with the estimated mean of the latent code  $\mu_{\theta ,c}\in \mathbb{R}^{K}$  and the predefined standard distribution  $\sigma^t I$  decreasing with respect to  $t$ .

Initial State. Given an incomplete point cloud, we set the initial state  $s^0$  of the sampling chain by setting the occupancy  $o_c$  to be 1 for the cells that contain point cloud and associating the occupied cells with a latent code sampled from the isotropic normal distribution. However, the input can better describe the provided partial geometry if we encode the latent code  $z_c$  of the occupied cells with the encoder  $g_{\phi}$ . The final completion is more precise when all the transitions  $p_{\theta}$  are conditioned with the initial state containing the encoded latent code. Further details are described in Appendix A.

Mode Seeking. While we effectively model the probabilistic distribution of multi-modal shapes, the final reconstruction needs to converge to a single coherent shape. Naive sampling of the stochastic transition kernel in Eq. (4) can include noisy voxels with low-occupancy probability. As a simple trick, we augment mode seeking steps that determine the most probable mode of the current result instead of probabilistic sampling. Specifically, we run additional  $T'$  steps of the transition kernel but we select the cells with probability higher than 0.5 and set the latent code as the mean of the distribution  $\mu_{\theta, c}$ . The mode seeking steps ensure that the final shape discovers the dominant mode that is closest to  $s^T$  as depicted in Fig. 2, where it can be transformed into implicit function with the pretrained decoder  $f_w$ .

# 3.3 TRAINING CONTINUOUS GENERATIVE CELLULAR AUTOMATA

We train a homogeneous transition kernel  $p_{\theta}(s^{t + 1}|s^t)$ , whose repetitive applications eventually yield the samples that follow the learned distribution. However, the data contains only the initial  $s^0$  and the ground truth state  $x$ , and we need to emulate the sequence for training. We adapt infusion training (Bordes et al. (2017)), which induces the intermediate transitions to converge to the desired complete state. To this end, we define a function  $G_{x}(s)$  that finds the valid cells that are closest to the complete shape  $x$  within the neighborhood of the current state  $\mathcal{N}(s)$ :

$$
G _ {x} (s) = \left\{\operatorname * {a r g m i n} _ {c \in \mathcal {N} (s)} d \left(c, c ^ {\prime}\right) \mid c ^ {\prime} \in x \right\}. \tag {7}
$$

Then, we define the infusion kernel  $q^{t}$  factorized similarly as the sampling kernel in Eq. (4):

$$
q _ {\theta} ^ {t} \left(s ^ {t + 1} \mid s ^ {t}, x\right) = \prod_ {c \in \mathcal {N} \left(s ^ {t}\right)} q _ {\theta} ^ {t} \left(o _ {c}, z _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}, x\right) = \prod_ {c \in \mathcal {N} \left(s ^ {t}\right)} q _ {\theta} ^ {t} \left(o _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}, x\right) q _ {\theta} ^ {t} \left(z _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}, o _ {c}, x\right). \tag {8}
$$

The distributions for both  $o_c$  and  $z_{c}$  are gradually biased towards the ground truth final shape  $x$  with the infusion rate  $\alpha^t$ , which increases linearly with respect to time step, i.e.,  $\alpha^t = \max (\alpha_1t + \alpha_0,1)$  with  $\alpha_{1} > 0$ :

$$
q _ {\theta} ^ {t} \left(o _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}, x\right) = B e r \left(\left(1 - \alpha^ {t}\right) \lambda_ {\theta , c} + \alpha^ {t} \mathbb {1} \left[ c \in G _ {x} \left(s ^ {t}\right) \right]\right), \tag {9}
$$

$$
q _ {\theta} ^ {t} \left(z _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}, o _ {c}, x\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \delta_ {0} & \text {i f} o _ {c} = 0 \\ N \left(\left(1 - \alpha^ {t}\right) \mu_ {\theta , c} + \alpha^ {t} z _ {c} ^ {x}, \sigma^ {t} I\right) & \text {i f} o _ {c} = 1. \end{array} \right. \tag {10}
$$

Here  $\mathbb{1}$  is an indicator function, and we will denote  $o_c^x,z_c^x$  as the occupancy and latent code of the ground truth complete shape  $x$  at coordinate  $c$ .

cGCA aims to optimize the log-likelihood of the ground truth sparse voxel embedding  $\log p_{\theta}(x)$ . However, since the direct optimization of the exact log-likelihood is intractable, we modify the variational lower bound using the derivation of diffusion-based models (Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015)):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log p _ {\theta} (x) \geq \sum_ {s ^ {0: T - 1}} q _ {\theta} \left(s ^ {0: T - 1} | x\right) \log \frac {p _ {\theta} \left(s ^ {0 : T - 1} , x\right)}{q _ {\theta} \left(s ^ {0 : T - 1} | x\right)} \tag {11} \\ = \underbrace {\log \frac {p (s ^ {0})}{q (s ^ {0})}} _ {\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {i n i t}}} + \sum_ {0 \leq t <   T - 1} \underbrace {- D _ {K L} (q _ {\theta} (s ^ {t + 1} | s ^ {t} , x) \| p _ {\theta} (s ^ {t + 1} | s ^ {t}))} _ {\mathcal {L} _ {t}} + \underbrace {\mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\theta}} [ \log p _ {\theta} (x | s ^ {T - 1}) ]} _ {\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {f i n a l}}}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where the full derivation is in Appendix B.1. We now analyze  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{init}},\mathcal{L}_t,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{final}}$  separately. We ignore the term  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{init}}$  during optimization since it contains no trainable parameters.  $\mathcal{L}_t$  for  $0\leq t < T - 1$  can be decomposed as the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {L} _ {t} = - \sum_ {c \in \mathcal {N} (s ^ {t})} \underbrace {D _ {K L} \left(q _ {\theta} \left(o _ {c} \mid s ^ {t} , x\right) \| p _ {\theta} \left(o _ {c} \mid s ^ {t}\right)\right)} _ {\mathcal {L} _ {o}} \\ + q _ {\theta} \left(o _ {c} = 1 \mid s ^ {t}, x\right) \underbrace {D _ {K L} \left(q _ {\theta} \left(z _ {c} \mid s ^ {t} , x , o _ {c} = 1\right) \| p _ {\theta} \left(z _ {c} \mid s ^ {t} , o _ {c} = 1\right)\right)} _ {\mathcal {L} _ {z}}, \tag {12} \\ \end{array}
$$

where the full derivation is in Appendix B.2. Since  $\mathcal{L}_o$  and  $\mathcal{L}_z$  are the KL divergence between Bernoulli and normal distributions, respectively,  $L_{t}$  can be written in a closed-form. In practice, the scale of  $\mathcal{L}_z$  can be much larger than that of  $\mathcal{L}_o$ . This results in local minima in the gradient-based optimization and reduces the occupancy probability  $q_{\theta}(o_c = 1|s^t,x)$  for every cell. So we balance the two losses by multiplying a hyperparameter  $\gamma$  at  $\mathcal{L}_z$ , which is fixed as  $\gamma = 0.01$  for all experiments.

The last term  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{final}}$  can be written as following:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {f i n a l}} = \sum_ {c \in \mathcal {N} \left(s ^ {T - 1}\right)} \log \left\{\left(1 - \lambda_ {\theta , c}\right) \mathbb {1} \left[ o _ {c} ^ {x} = 0 \right] \delta_ {0} \left(z _ {c} ^ {x}\right) + \lambda_ {\theta , c} \mathbb {1} \left[ o _ {c} ^ {x} = 1 \right] N \left(z _ {c} ^ {x}; \mu_ {\theta , c}, \sigma^ {T - 1} I\right) \right\}. \tag {13}
$$

A problem rises when computing  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{final}}$ , since the usage of Dirac distribution makes  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{final}} \to \infty$  if  $o_c^x = 0$ , which does not produce a valid gradient for optimization. However, we can replace the loss  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{final}}$  with a well-behaved loss  $\mathcal{L}_t$  for  $t = T - 1$ , by using the following proposition:

Proposition 1. Assume  $\delta_0(z_c^x)$  is replaced by the indicator function  $\mathbb{1}[z_c^x = 0]$  when computing  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{final}}$ . Then  $\nabla \mathcal{L}_{T - 1} = \nabla \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{final}}$ , for  $T\gg 1$ .

Proof. The proof is found in Appendix B.3.

The proposition above serves as a justification for approximating  $\nabla \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{final}}$  as  $\nabla \mathcal{L}_{T - 1}$ , with the benefits of having a simpler training procedure and easier implementation. Replacing  $\delta_0(z_c^T)$  with  $\mathbb{1}[z_c^x = 0]$  can be regarded as a reweighting technique that naturally avoids divergence in the lower bound, since both functions output a non-zero value only at 0. Further discussions about the replacement are in Appendix B.3.

In conclusion, the training procedure is outlined as follows:

1. Sample  $s^{0:T}$  by  $s^0 \sim q^0$ ,  $s^{t + 1} \sim q_\theta^t (\cdot |s^t,x)$ .  
2. For  $t < T$ , update  $\theta$  with  $\theta \gets \theta + \eta \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_t$ , where  $\eta$  is the learning rate.

Note that the original infusion training (Bordes et al. (2017)) also attempts to minimize the variational lower bound, employing the Monte Carlo approximation with reparameterization trick (Kingma & Welling (2014)) to compute the gradients. However, our objective avoids the approximations and can compute the exact lower bound for a single training step. The proposed simplification can be applied to infusion training with any data structure including images.

Figure 3: Qualitative comparison on ShapeNet scene dataset. Best viewed on screen. Minimum rate indicates the guaranteed rate of surface points for each object in the scene. While deterministic methods (ConvOcc, IFNet) produce blurry surfaces since they cannot model multi-modal distribution, probabilistic methods (GCA, cGCA) generate multiple plausible scenes. cGCA is the only method that can generate multiple plausible scenes without losing the details for each object.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We test the quality probabilistic shape completion of cGCA for scenes (Section 4.1) and single object (Section 4.2). For all the experiments, we use latent code dimension  $K = 32$ , trained with regularization parameter  $\beta = 0.001$ . Further implementation details are in Appendix A.2.

# 4.1 SCENE COMPLETION

In this section, we evaluate our method on two datasets: ShapeNet scene (Songyou et al. (2020)) and 3DFront (Fu et al. (2020)) dataset. The input incomplete scans are created by iteratively removing points within a fixed distance from a random surface point. We control the minimum preserved ratio of the original complete surface points for each object in the scene to test varying levels of completeness. The levels of completeness tested are 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 with each dataset trained/tested separately. We evaluate the quality and diversity of the completion results by measuring the Chamfer-L1 distance (CD), total mutual distance (TMD), respectively, as in the previous methods (Songyou et al. (2020); Zhang et al. (2021)). For probabilistic methods, five completion results are generated and we report the minimum and average of Chamfer-L1 distance (min. CD, avg. CD). Note that if the input is severely incomplete, there exist various modes of completion that might be feasible but deviate from its ground truth geometry. Nonetheless, we still compare CD assuming that plausible reconstructions are likely to be similar to the ground truth.

ShapeNet Scene. ShapeNet scene contains synthetic rooms that contain multiple ShapeNet (Chang et al. (2015)) objects, which have been randomly scaled with randomly scaled floor and random walls. We compare the performance of cGCA with two deterministic scene completion models that utilize

Since the raw inputs of furniture are highly incomplete, there exist multiple plausible reconstructions. Probabilistic approaches produce diverse yet detailed scene geometry. GCA suffers from artifacts due to the discrete voxel resolution.

occupancy as the implicit representation: ConvOcc (Songyou et al. (2020)) and IFNet (Chibane et al. (2020a)). We additionally test the quality of our completion against a probabilistic method of GCA (Zhang et al. (2021)). Both GCA and cGCA use  $64^{3}$  voxel resolution with  $T = 15$  transitions. cGCA (w/ cond.) indicates a variant of our model, where each transition is conditioned on the initial state  $s^0$  obtained by the encoder  $g_{\phi}$  as discussed in Sec. 3.2.

Table 1 contains the quantitative comparison on ShapeNet scene. Both versions of cGCA outperform all other methods on min. CD for all level of completeness. In general, the probabilistic models (GCA, cGCA) always achieve lower CDs on average compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic models. The performance gap is especially prominent for highly incomplete input, which can be visually verified from Fig. 3. The deterministic models generate blurry objects given high uncertainty, while our method consistently generates detailed reconstructions for inputs with different levels of completeness. Our result coincides with the well-known phenomena of generative models, where the deterministic models fail to generate crisp outputs of multi-modal distribution (Goodfellow (2017)). Considering practical scenarios with irregular real-world scans, our probabilistic formulation is crucial for accurate 3D scene completion. When conditioned with the initial state, the completion results of cGCA stay faithful to the input data, achieving lower CDs. Note that the high diversity for GCA are partially due to the discretization artifacts.

3DFront. 3DFront is a large-scale indoor synthetic scene dataset with professionally designed layouts and contains high-quality 3D objects, in contrast to random object placement for ShapeNet scene. 3DFront dataset represents the realistic scenario where the objects are composed of multiple meshes

without clear boundaries for inside or outside. Unless the input is carefully processed to be converted into a watertight mesh, the set-up excludes many of the common choices for implicit representation, such as occupancy or signed distance fields. However, the formulation of cGCA can be easily adapted for different implicit representation, and we employ unsigned distance fields (Chibane et al. (2020b)) to create the sparse voxel embedding for 3DFront dataset. We compare the performance of cGCA against GCA, both with voxel resolution of  $5\mathrm{cm}$  and  $T = 25$  transitions.

Table 2 shows that cGCA outperforms GCA by a large margin in CD, generating high-fidelity reconstructions with unsigned distance fields. While both GCA and cGCA are capable of generating multiple plausible results, GCA suffers from discretization artifacts due to the voxelized representation, as shown in Fig 4. cGCA not only overcomes the limitation of the resolution, but also is scalable to process the entire rooms at once during both training and test time. In contrast, previous methods for scene completion (Siddiqui et al.; Songyou et al. (2020)) divide the scene into small sections and separately complete them. We analyze the scalability in terms of the network parameters and the GPU usage in Appendix C.

# 4.2 SINGLE OBJECT COMPLETION

We analyze various performance metrics of cGCA for a single object completion with chair/sofa/table classes of ShapeNet (Chang et al. (2015)) dataset. Given densely sampled points of a normalized object in  $[-1, 1]^3$ , the incomplete observation is generated by selecting points within the sphere of radius 0.5 centered at one of the surface points. From the partial observation, we sample 1,024 points which serve as a sparse input, and sample 2,048 points from completion results for testing. Following the previous method (Wu et al. (2020)), we generate ten completions and compare MMD (quality), UHD (fidelity), and TMD (diversity). Our method is compared against other probabilistic shape completion methods: cGAN (Wu et al. (2020)) which is based on point cloud, and GCA (Zhang et al. (2021)) which uses voxel representation. We use  $T = 30$  transitions.

Quantitative and qualitative results are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5. Our approach exceeds other baselines in all metrics, indicating that cGCA can generate high-quality completions (MMD) that are faithful to input (UHD) while being diverse (TMD). With the help of latent codes, the completed

continuous surface of cGCA can capture geometry beyond its voxel resolution. The quality of completed shape in  $32^{3}$  voxel resolution therefore even outperforms in MMD for discrete GCA in higher  $64^{3}$  voxel resolution. Also, the UHD score of cGCA (w/ cond.) exceeds that of GCA and vanilla cGCA indicating that conditioning latent codes from the input indeed preserves the input partial geometry.

# 5 RELATED WORKS

3D Shape Completion. The data-driven completion of 3D shapes demands a large amount of memory and computation. The memory requirement for voxel-based methods increases cubically to the resolution (Dai et al. (2017b)) while the counterpart of point cloud based representations (Yuan et al. (2018)) roughly increases linearly with the number of points. Extensions of scene completion in voxel space utilize hierarchical representation (Dai et al. (2018)) or subdivided scenes (Dai et al. (2018; 2020)) with sparse voxel representations. Recently, deep implicit representations (Park et al. (2019); Chen & Zhang (2019); Mescheder et al. (2019)) suggest a way to overcome the limitation of resolution. Subsequent works (Chabra et al. (2020); Chibane et al. (2020a); Jiang et al. (2020); Songyou et al. (2020)) demonstrate methods to extend the representation to large-scale scenes. However, most works are limited to regressing a single surface from a given observation. Only a few recent works (Wu et al. (2020); Zhang et al. (2021); Smith & Meger (2017)) generate multiple plausible outcomes by modeling the distribution of surface conditioned on the observation. cGCA suggests a scalable solution for multi-modal continuous shape completion by employing progressive generation with continuous shape representations.

Diffusion Probabilistic Models. One way to capture the complex data distribution by the generative model is to use a diffusion process inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics such as Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015); Ho et al. (2020); Luo & Hu (2021). The diffusion process incrementally destroys the data distribution by adding noise, whereas the transition kernel learns to revert the process that restores the data structure. The learned distribution is flexible and easy to sample from, but it is designed to evolve from a random distribution. On the other hand, the infusion training by Bordes et al. (2017) applies a similar technique but creates a forward chain instead of reverting the diffusion process. Since the infusion training can start from a structured input distribution, it is more suitable to a shape completion that starts from a partial data input. However, the infusion training approximates the lower bound of variational distribution with Monte Carlo estimates using the reparameterization trick (Kingma & Welling (2014)). We modify the training objective and introduce a simple variant of infusion training that can maximize the variational lower bound of the log-likelihood of the data distribution without using Monte Carlo approximation.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We are the first to tackle the challenging task of probabilistic scene completion, which requires not only the model to generate multiple plausible outcomes but also be scalable to capture the wide-range context of multiple objects. To this end, we propose continuous Generative Cellular Automata, a scalable generative model for completing multiple plausible continuous surfaces from an incomplete point cloud. cGCA compresses the implicit field into sparse voxels associated with their latent code named sparse voxel embedding, and incrementally generates diverse implicit surfaces. The training objective is proven to maximize the variational lower bound of the likelihood of sparse voxel embeddings, indicating that cGCA is a theoretically valid generative model. Results in scene and shape completions show that our model is able to faithfully generate multiple plausible surfaces from partial observation.

There are a few interesting future directions. Our results are evaluated with synthetic scene datasets where the ground truth data is available. It would be interesting to see how well the data performs in real data with self-supervised learning. For example, we can extend our method to real scenes such as ScanNet Dai et al. (2017a) or Matterport 3D (Chang et al. (2017)) by training the infusion chain with data altered to have different levels of completeness as suggested by Dai et al. (2020). Also, our work requires two-stage training, where the transition kernel is trained with the ground truth latent codes generated from the pre-trained autoencoder. It would be less cumbersome if the training could be done in an end-to-end fashion.

# 7 ETHICS STATEMENT

The goal of our model is to generate diverse plausible scenes given an observation obtained by sensors. While recovering the detailed geometry of real scenes is crucial for many VR/AR and robotics applications, it might violate proprietary or individual privacy rights when abused. Generating the unseen part can also be regarded as creating fake information that can deceive people as real.
