# ABSTRACT

Recourse actions, also known as counterfactual explanations, aim to explain a particular algorithmic decision by showing one or multiple ways in which the instance could be modified to receive an alternate outcome. Existing recourse recommendations often assume that the machine learning models do not change over time. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice because of data distribution shifts, and in this case, the recourse actions may become invalid. To redress this shortcoming, we propose the Distributionally Robust Recourse Action framework, which generates a recourse action that has high probability of being valid under a mixture of model shifts. We show that the robust recourse can be found efficiently using a projected gradient descent algorithm and we discuss several extensions of our framework. Numerical experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of our proposed framework.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Post-hoc explanations of machine learning models are useful for understanding and making reliable predictions in consequential domains such as loan approvals, college admission and healthcare. Recently, counterfactual explanations is rising as an attractive tool do diagnose why the machine learning models have made a particular decision for a given instance. Counterfactual explanations work by providing possible actions to modify a given instance to receive an alternate decision Wachter et al. (2018). Consider, for example, the case of loan approvals in which a credit application is rejected. The counterfactual will offer the reasons for rejection by showing what the application package should have been to get approved. A concrete example of a counterfactual in this case may be "the monthly salary should be higher by $500" or "20% of the current debt should be reduced".

Counterfactual explanations are equivalently known as contrastive explanations (Karimi et al., 2021) or recourses (Ustun et al., 2019), and we use these terms interchangeably. When viewed as recourses, the counterfactual explanations have a positive, forward-looking meaning: they list out the recourse actions that a person should implement so that they can get a more favorable outcome in the future. If a specific application can provide the negative outcomes with recourse actions, it can improve the user engagement and boost the interpretability at the same time. Explanations thus play a central role in the future development of human-centric machine learning.

Despite its attractiveness, providing recourse for the negative instances is not a trivial task. For real-world implementation, designing a recourse needs to strike an intricate balance between conflicting criteria. First and foremost, a recourse action should be feasible: if the prescribed action is taken, then the prediction of a machine learning model should be flipped. At the same time, a framework for generating recourse should minimize the cost to take recourse actions to avoid making a drastic change to the characteristics of the input instance. An algorithm for finding recourse must make change to only features that are actionable, and should leave immutable features (relatively) unchanged. For example, we must consider age as an immutable feature; in contrast, we can consider salary or debt amount as actionable features.

Various solutions has been proposed to provide recourse, or counterfactual explanations for a model prediction (Karimi et al., 2021; Stepin et al., 2021; Artelt & Hammer, 2019). For instance, Ustun et al. (2019) used an integer programming approach to obtain actionable recourses, and also provide a feasibility guarantee for linear models. Karimi et al. (2020) proposed a model-agnostic approach to generate nearest counterfactual explanations and focus on structured data. Dandl et al. (2020) proposed a method which finds counterfactual by solving a multi-objective optimization problem.

Recently, Russell (2019) and Mothilal et al. (2020) focus on finding a set of multiple diverse recourse actions, where the diversity is imposed by a rule-based approach or by internalize a determinant point process cost in the objective function.

These aforementioned approaches make a fundamental assumption that the machine learning model does not change over time. However, the dire reality suggests that this assumption rarely holds. In fact, data shifts are so common nowadays in machine learning that they have sparkled the emerging field of domain generalization and domain adaptation. Data shifts usually induce corresponding shifts in the machine learning models' parameters, which in turns cause serious concerns for the feasibility of the recourse action in the future (Rawal et al., 2021). In fact, all of the aforementioned approaches design the action which is feasible only with the current model parameters, and they provide no feasibility guarantee for the future parameters. If a recourse action fails to generate a favorable outcome in the future, then the recourse action becomes useless, the pledge of a brighter outcome is shattered, and the trust on the machine learning system is lost.

To tackle this challenge, Upadhyay et al. (2021) proposed ROAR, a framework for generating instance level recourses (counterfactual explanations) that are robust to shifts in the underlying predictive model. ROAR used a robust optimization approach that hedges against an uncertainty set containing plausible values of the future model parameters. However, it is well-known that robust optimization solutions can be overly conservative because it may hedge against a pathological parameter in the uncertainty set. A promising approach that can promote robustness, while at the same time prevent from over-conservatism is the distributionally robust optimization framework (El Ghaoui et al., 2003; Delage & Ye, 2010; Rahimian & Mehrotra, 2019; Bertsimas et al., 2018). This framework models the future model parameters as random variables whose underlying distribution is unknown, but is likely to be contained in an ambiguity set. The solution is designed to counter the worst-case distribution in the ambiguity set in a min-max sense. Distributionally robust optimization is also gaining popularity in many estimation and prediction tasks in machine learning (Namkoong & Duchi, 2017; Kuhn et al., 2019).

Contributions. This paper combines ideas and techniques from two principal branches of explainable artificial intelligence: counterfactual explanations and robustness, in order to resolve the recourse problem under uncertainty. Concretely, our main contributions are the following:

1. We propose the framework of Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) for designing a recourse action that is robust to mixture shifts of the model parameters. Our DiRRAc maximizes the probability that the action is feasible with respect to a mixture shift of model parameters, while at the same time cap the action in the neighborhood of the input instance. Moreover, the DiRRAc model also hedges against the misspecification of the nominal distribution using a min-max form with a mixture ambiguity set prescribed by moment information.  
2. We reformulate the DiRRAc problem into a finite-dimensional optimization problem with an explicit objective function. We also provide a projected gradient descent to solve the resulting reformulation with convergence guarantees.  
3. We extend our DiRRAc framework along several axis to handle mixture weight uncertainty, to minimize the worst-case component probability of receiving unfavorable outcome, and also to inject the Gaussian parametric information.

We first describe the recourse action problem with mixture shift in Section 2. In Section 3, we present our proposed DiRRAc framework, its reformulation and the numerical routine for solving it. Three extensions will be subsequently discussed in Section 4. Section 5 reports the numerical experiments showing the benefits of the DiRRAc framework and its extensions.

Notations. For each integer  $K$ , we have  $[K] = \{1, \ldots, K\}$ . We use  $\mathbb{S}_+^d (\mathbb{S}_{++}^d)$  to denote the space of symmetric positive semidefinite (definite, respectively) matrices. For any  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ , the trace operator is defined as  $\operatorname{Tr}[A] = \sum_{i=1}^{d} A_{ii}$ . We write  $\mathbb{Q}_k \sim (\mu_k, \Sigma_k)$  to denote that the distribution  $\mathbb{Q}_k$  has mean vector  $\mu_k$  and covariance matrix  $\Sigma_k$ . If additionally  $\mathbb{Q}_k$  is Gaussian, we write  $\mathbb{Q}_k \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \Sigma_k)$ . With a slight abuse of notation,  $\mathbb{Q} \sim (\mathbb{Q}_k, p_k)_{k \in [K]}$  means  $\mathbb{Q}$  is a mixture of  $K$  component distributions, the  $k$ -th component has weight  $p_k$  and distribution  $\mathbb{Q}_k$ .

# 2 RECOOURSE ACTION UNDER MIXTURE SHIFTS

We consider a binary classification setting with label  $\mathcal{V} = \{0,1\}$ , where 0 represents the unfavorable outcome while 1 denotes the favorable one. The covariate space is  $\mathbb{R}^d$ , and any linear classifier  $\mathcal{C}_{\theta}:\mathbb{R}^{d}\to \mathcal{V}$  characterized by the  $d$ -dimensional parameter  $\theta$  is of the form

$$
\mathcal {C} _ {\theta} (x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1 & \text {i f} \theta^ {\top} x \geq 0, \\ 0 & \text {o t h e r w i s e .} \end{array} \right.
$$

Note that the bias term can be internalized into  $\theta$  by adding an extra dimension, and thus it is omitted.

Suppose that at this moment  $(t = 0)$ , the current classifier is parametrized by  $\theta_0$ , and we are given an input instance  $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d$  with unfavorable outcome, that is,  $\mathcal{C}_{\theta_0}(x_0) = 0$ . One period of time from now  $(t = 1)$ , the parameters of the predictive model will change stochastically, and are represented by a  $d$ -dimensional random vector  $\tilde{\theta}$ . This paper focuses on finding a recourse action  $x$  which is reasonably close to the instance  $x_0$ , and at the same time, has a high probability of receiving a favorable outcome in the future. Figure 1 gives a bird's eye view of the setup

Figure 1: A canonical setup of the recourse action under mixture shifts problem.

To measure the closeness between the action  $x$  and the input  $x_0$ , we assume that the covariate space is endowed with a non-negative, continuous cost function  $c$ . In addition, suppose temporarily that  $\tilde{\theta}$  follows a distribution  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}$ . Because maximizing the probability of the favorable outcome is equivalent to minimizing the probability of the unfavorable outcome, the recourse action  $x$  can be found by solving

$$
\min  _ {x \neq} \quad \widehat {\mathbb {P}} \left(\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0\right) \tag {1}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {s . t .} & x \in \mathbb {X}, c (x, x _ {0}) \leq \delta . \end{array}
$$

The parameter  $\delta \geq 0$  in (1) governs how far a recourse action can be from the input instance  $x_0$ . Note that we constrain  $x$  in a set  $\mathbb{X}$  which captures operational constraints, for example, the highest education of a credit applicant should not be decreasing over time.

In this paper, we model the random vector  $\tilde{\theta}$  using a finite mixture of distributions with  $K$  components, the mixture weights are  $\widehat{p}$  satisfying  $\sum_{k\in [K]}\widehat{p}_k = 1$ . Each component in the mixture represents one specific type of data shifts: the weights  $\widehat{p}$  reflect the proportion of the shift types while the component distribution  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$  representing the (conditional) distribution of the future model parameters in the  $k$ -th shift. Further information on mixture distributions and their applications in machine learning can be found in Murphy (2012, §3.5).

If each  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$  is a Gaussian distribution  $\mathcal{N}(\widehat{\theta}_k,\widehat{\Sigma}_k)$ , then  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}$  is a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The objective of problem (1) can be expressed as

$$
\widehat {\mathbb {P}} \left(\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0\right) = \sum_ {k \in [ K ]} \widehat {p} _ {k} \widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k} \left(\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0\right) = \sum_ {k \in [ K ]} \widehat {p} _ {k} \Phi \left(\frac {- x ^ {\top} \widehat {\theta} _ {k}}{\sqrt {x ^ {\top} \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k} x}}\right),
$$

where the first equality follows from the law of conditional probability, and  $\Phi$  is the cumulative distribution function of a standard Gaussian distribution. Under the Gaussian assumption, we can solve (1) using a projected gradient descent type of algorithm (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004).

There are, however, several downsides with the recourse action formulation (1). First, in order to have an explicit formula for  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k(\mathcal{C}_{\tilde{\theta}}(x) = 0)$ , one typically needs to make a strong assumption on a certain parametric form for  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$ , for example, Gaussian, t-distribution, etc. Second, even after making the parametric assumption, it is still difficult to pin down the correct set of parameters for  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$ , such

as the mean vector  $\widehat{\theta}_k$  and the covariance matrix  $\widehat{\Sigma}_k$  in the Gaussian case. The reason is that it is challenging to identify the direction of the future data shifts, and low sample sizes also lead to statistical errors in the estimation of the parameters. The next section applies the distributionally robust optimization techniques into problem (1) to alleviate these two shortcomings.

Remark 2.1 (Nonlinear models). Our analysis focuses on linear classifiers, which is a common setup in the literature (Upadhyay et al., 2021; Ustun et al., 2019; Rawal et al., 2021; Karimi et al., 2020; Wachter et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2016). To extend to nonlinear classifiers, we can follow a similar approach as in Rawal & Lakkaraju (2020) and Upadhyay et al. (2021) by first using LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) to approximate the nonlinear classifiers locally with an interpretable linear model, then subsequently applying our framework.

# 3 DISTRIBUTIONALLY ROBUST REOURSE ACTION FRAMEWORK

Our Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) framework robustifies formulation (1) by relaxing the parametric assumption and hedging against distribution misspecification. First, we assume that the mixture components  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$  are specified only through moment information, and no particular parametric form of the distribution is imposed. In effect,  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$  is assumed to have mean vector  $\widehat{\theta}_k\in \mathbb{R}^d$  and positive definite covariance matrix  $\widehat{\Sigma}_k\succ 0$ . Second, we leverage ideas from distributionally robust optimization to propose a min-max formulation of (1), in which we consider an ambiguity set which contains a family of probability distributions that are sufficiently close to the nominal distribution  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}$ . To prescribe the ambiguity set, we use the Gelbrich distance.

Definition 3.1 (Gelbrich distance). The Gelbrich distance  $\mathbb{G}$  between two tuples  $(\theta, \Sigma) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{S}_+^d$  and  $(\widehat{\theta}, \widehat{\Sigma}) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{S}_+^d$  amounts to  $\mathbb{G}((\theta, \Sigma), (\widehat{\theta}, \widehat{\Sigma})) \triangleq \sqrt{\|\theta - \widehat{\theta}\|_2^2 + \operatorname{Tr}\left[\Sigma + \widehat{\Sigma} - 2\left(\widehat{\Sigma}^{\frac{1}{2}}\Sigma \widehat{\Sigma}^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]}$ .

It is easy to verify that  $\mathbb{G}$  is non-negative, symmetric and it vanishes to zero if and only if  $(\theta ,\Sigma) = (\widehat{\theta},\widehat{\Sigma})$ . Further,  $\mathbb{G}$  is a distance on  $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{S}_+^d$  because it coincides with the type-2 Wasserstein distance between two Gaussian distributions  $\mathcal{N}(\mu ,\Sigma)$  and  $\mathcal{N}(\widehat{\mu},\widehat{\Sigma})$  (Givens & Shortt, 1984). Distributely robust formulations with moment information prescribed by the  $\mathbb{G}$  distance are computationally tractable under mild conditions, deliver reasonable performance guarantees and also generate a conservative approximation of the Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization problem (Kuhn et al., 2019).

In this paper, we use the Gelbrich distance  $\mathbb{G}$  to form a neighborhood around each  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$  as

$$
\mathcal {B} _ {k} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k}) \triangleq \left\{\mathbb {Q} _ {k}: \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \sim \left(\theta_ {k}, \Sigma_ {k}\right), \mathbb {G} \left(\left(\theta_ {k}, \Sigma_ {k}\right), \left(\widehat {\theta} _ {k}, \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k}\right)\right) \leq \rho_ {k} \right\}.
$$

Intuitively, one can view  $\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$  as a ball centered at the nominal component  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$  of radius  $\rho_k \geq 0$  prescribed using the distance  $\mathbb{G}$ . This component set  $\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$  is non-parametric, and the first two moments of  $\mathbb{Q}_k$  are sufficient to decide whether  $\mathbb{Q}_k$  belongs to  $\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$ . Moreover, if  $\mathbb{Q}_k \in \mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$ , then any distribution  $\mathbb{Q}_k'$  with the same mean vector and covariance matrix as  $\mathbb{Q}_k$  also belongs to  $\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$ . Notice that even when the radius  $\rho_k$  is zero, the component set  $\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$  does not collapse into a singleton. Instead, if  $\rho_k = 0$  then  $\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$  still contains all distributions of the same moment  $(\widehat{\theta}_k, \widehat{\Sigma}_k)$  with the nominal component distribution  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$ , and consequently it possesses the robustification effects against the parametric assumption on  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$ . The component sets are utilized to construct the ambiguity set for the mixture distribution as

$$
\mathcal {B} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}}) \triangleq \left\{\mathbb {Q}: \exists \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k}) \forall k \in [ K ] \text {s u c h t h a t} \mathbb {Q} \sim (\mathbb {Q} _ {k}, \widehat {p _ {k}}) _ {k \in [ K ]} \right\}.
$$

Any  $\mathbb{Q} \in \mathcal{B}(\widehat{\mathbb{P}})$  is also a mixture distribution with  $K$  components, with the same mixture weights  $\widehat{p}$ . Thus,  $\mathcal{B}(\widehat{\mathbb{P}})$  contains all perturbations of  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}$  induced separately on each component by  $\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$ .

We are now ready to introduce our DiRRAc model, which is a min-max problem of the form

$$
\begin{array}{l} \inf  \sup  \mathbb {Q} (\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0) \\ \mathbb {Q} \in \mathcal {B} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}}) \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {s . t .} \quad c (x, x _ {0}) \leq \delta \tag {2} \\ \sup  \mathbb {Q} _ {k} (\mathcal {C} _ {\bar {\theta}} (x) = 0) <   1 \quad \forall k \in [ K ]. \\ \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k}) \\ \end{array}
$$

The objective of (2) is to minimize the worst-case probability of unfavorable outcome of the recourse action. Moreover, the last constraint imposes that for each component, the worst-case conditional probability of unfavorable outcome should be strictly less than 1. Put differently, this last constraint requires that the action should be able to lead to favorable outcome for any distribution in  $\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$ . Next, we will reformulate the DiRRAc problem (2) and propose a numerical solution routine.

# 3.1 REFORMULATION OF DIRRAC

Each supremum in (2) is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem on the space of probability distributions. We now show that (2) can be reformulated as a finite-dimensional problem. Towards this end, let  $\mathcal{X}$  be the following  $d$ -dimensional set

$$
\mathcal {X} \triangleq \left\{x \in \mathbb {X}: c \left(x, x _ {0}\right) \leq \delta , - \widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x + \rho_ {k} \| x \| _ {2} <   0 \forall k \in [ K ] \right\}. \tag {3}
$$

The next theorem asserts that the DiRRAc problem (2) can be reformulated as a  $d$ -dimensional optimization problem with an explicit, but complicated, objective function.

Theorem 3.2 (Equivalent form of DiRRAc). Problem (2) is equivalent to the following problem

$$
\inf  _ {x \in \mathcal {X}} \sum_ {k \in [ K ]} \widehat {p _ {k}} \left(\frac {\rho_ {k} \widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x \| x \| _ {2} + \sqrt {x ^ {\top} \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k} x} \sqrt {(\widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x) ^ {2} + x ^ {\top} \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k} x - \rho_ {k} ^ {2} \| x \| _ {2} ^ {2}}}{(\widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x) ^ {2} + x ^ {\top} \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k} x}\right) ^ {2} \tag {4}
$$

We now sketch the proof of Theorem 3.2. For any component  $k \in [K]$ , define the following worst-case probability of unfavorable outcome function

$$
f _ {k} (x) \triangleq \sup  _ {\mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k})} \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \left(\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0\right) = \sup  _ {\mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} \left(\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k}\right)} \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \left(\tilde {\theta} ^ {\top} x \leq 0\right) \quad \forall k \in [ K ]. \tag {5}
$$

The next proposition provides the analytical form of  $f_{k}(x)$ .

Proposition 3.3 (Worst-case probability). For any  $k \in [K]$  and  $(\widehat{\theta}_k, \widehat{\Sigma}_k, \rho_k) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{S}_+^d \times \mathbb{R}_+$ , define the following constants  $A_k \triangleq -\widehat{\theta}_k^\top x$ ,  $B_k \triangleq \sqrt{x^\top \widehat{\Sigma}_k x}$ , and  $C_k \triangleq \rho_k \| x \|_2$ . We have

$$
f_{k}(x)\triangleq \sup_{\mathbb{Q}_{k}\in \mathcal{B}_{k}(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_{k})}\mathbb{Q}_{k}(\tilde{\theta}^{\top}x\leq 0) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1 & if  A_{k} + C_{k}\geq 0,\\ \Big(\frac{-A_{k}C_{k} + B_{k}\sqrt{A_{k}^{2} + B_{k}^{2} - C_{k}^{2}}}{A_{k}^{2} + B_{k}^{2}}\Big)^{2}\in (0,1) & if  A_{k} + C_{k} <   0. \end{array} \right.
$$

The proof of Theorem 3.2 follows by noticing that the DiRRAc problem (2) can be reformulated using the elementary functions  $f_{k}$  as

$$
\min  \left\{\sum_ {k \in [ K ]} \widehat {p} _ {k} f _ {k} (x): c (x, x _ {0}) \leq \delta , f _ {k} (x) \leq 0 \quad \forall k \in [ K ] \right\},
$$

where the objective function follows from the definition of the set  $\mathcal{B}(\widehat{\mathbb{P}})$ . It suffices now to combine with Proposition 3.3 to obtain the necessary result. The detailed proof is relegated to the Appendix.

# 3.2 PROJECTED GRADIENT DESCENT ALGORITHM

We consider in this section an iterative numerical routine to solve the DiRRaAc problem in the equivalent form (4). First, notice that the second constraint that defines  $\mathcal{X}$  in (3) is a strict inequality, thus the set  $\mathcal{X}$  is open. We thus modify slightly this constraint by considering the following set

$$
\mathcal {X} _ {\varepsilon} = \left\{x \in \mathbb {X}: c (x, x _ {0}) \leq \delta , - \widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x + \rho_ {k} \| x \| _ {2} \leq - \varepsilon \quad \forall k \in [ K ] \right\}
$$

for some value  $\varepsilon > 0$  sufficiently small. Moreover, if the parameter  $\delta$  is too small, it may happen that the feasible set  $\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}$  becomes empty. Let  $\delta_{\mathrm{min}} \in \mathbb{R}_+$  be defined as the optimal value of the following optimization problem

$$
\delta_ {\min } \triangleq \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \inf  & c \left(x, x _ {0}\right) \\ \text {s . t .} & x \in \mathbb {X}, - \widehat {\theta_ {k} ^ {\top}} x + \rho_ {k} \| x \| _ {2} \leq - \varepsilon \quad \forall k \in [ K ]. \end{array} \right. \tag {6}
$$

Then it is easy to see that  $\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}$  is non-empty whenever  $\delta \geq \delta_{\mathrm{min}}$ . In addition, because  $c$  is continuous and  $\mathbb{X}$  is closed, the set  $\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}$  is compact. In this case, we can consider problem (4) with the feasible set being  $\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}$ , for which the optimal solution is guaranteed to exist.

Algorithm 1 Projected gradient descent algorithm with backtracking line-search  
Input: Input instance  $x_0$  , feasible set  $\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}$  and objective function  $f$    
Line search parameters:  $\lambda \in (0,1),\zeta >0$  (Default values:  $\lambda = 0.7,\zeta = 1$    
Initialization: Set  $x^0\gets \mathrm{Proj}_{\mathcal{X}_\varepsilon}(x_0)$    
for  $t = 0,\dots ,T - 1$  do Find the smallest integer  $i\geq 0$  such that  $f\left(\mathrm{Proj}_{\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}}(x^{t} - \lambda^{i}\zeta \nabla f(x^{t}))\right)\leq f(x^{t}) - \frac{1}{2\lambda^{i}\zeta}\| x^{t} - \mathrm{Proj}_{\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}}(x^{t} - \lambda^{i}\zeta \nabla f(x^{t}))\|_{2}^{2}.$    
Set  $x^{t + 1} = \mathrm{Proj}_{\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}}(x^{t} - \lambda^{i}\zeta \nabla f(x^{t}))$    
end for   
Output:  $x^T$

Let us now define the projection operator  $\mathrm{Proj}_{\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}}$  as

$$
\mathrm {P r o j} _ {\mathcal {X} _ {\varepsilon}} (x ^ {\prime}) = \arg \min \left\{\| x - x ^ {\prime} \| _ {2} ^ {2}: x \in \mathcal {X} _ {\varepsilon} \right\}.
$$

If  $\mathbb{X}$  is convex and  $c(\cdot ,x_0)$  is a convex function, then  $\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}$  is also convex, and the projection operation can be efficiently computed using convex optimization. In particular, suppose that  $c(x,x_0) = \| x - x_0\| _2$  is the Euclidean norm and  $\mathbb{X}$  is second-order cone representable, then the projection is equivalent to a second-order cone program, and can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers such as GuroBI or Mosek (MOSEK ApS, 2019). The projection operator  $\mathrm{Proj}_{\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}}$  now forms the building block of a projected gradient descent algorithm with a backtracking linesearch, the pseudocode of which is presented in Algorithm 1. The convergence guarantee for Algorithm 1 follows from Beck (2017, Theorem 10.15), and is distilled in the next theorem.

Figure 2: Shaded area represents  $\mathcal{X}$ . Circular arc represents the proximity constraint  $c(x,x_0) = \delta$ . Dashed lines represent the hyperplane  $-\widehat{\theta_k^\top} x = 0$ , elliptic curves represent the robust margin  $-\widehat{\theta_k^\top} x + \rho_k\|x\| = 0$ . Increasing  $\rho_k$  brings the elliptic curves farther away from the dash lines, and the set  $\mathcal{X}$  moves deeper inside the favorable prediction region.

Theorem 3.4 (Convergence guarantee). Let  $\{x^t\}_{t = 0,1,\dots,T}$  be the sequence generated by Algorithm 1. Then, all limit points of the sequence  $\{x^t\}_{t = 0,1,\dots,T}$  are stationary points of problem (4) with the modified feasible set  $\mathcal{X}_{\varepsilon}$ . Furthermore, there exists some constant  $C > 0$  such that for any  $T\geq 1$ , we have

$$
\min  _ {t = 0, 1, \dots , T} \frac {\left\| x ^ {t} - \operatorname {P r o j} _ {\mathcal {X} _ {\varepsilon}} \left(x ^ {t} - \zeta \nabla f (x ^ {t})\right) \right\| _ {2}}{\zeta} \leq \frac {C}{\sqrt {T}}.
$$

# 4 EXTENSIONS OF THE DIRRAC FRAMEWORK

Throughout this section, we explore several extensions of our DiRRAc framework. In Section 4.1, we study an additional layer of robustification with respect to the mixture weights  $\widehat{p}$ . Next, in Section 4.2, we consider an alternative formulation of the objective function to minimize the worst-case component probability. Finally, we re-consider the Gaussian parametric setting, in which we are injecting the Gaussian distribution requirement to the ambiguity set. Imposing the Gaussian structure leads to the Gaussian DiRRAc problem.

# 4.1 ROBUSTIFICATION AGAINST MIXTURE WEIGHT UNCERTAINTY

The DiRRAc problem considered in Section 3 only robustifies the component distributions  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$ . We now discuss a plausible approach to robustify against the misspecification of the mixture weights

$\widehat{p}$ . Because the mixture weights should form a probability vector, it is convenient to model the perturbation in the mixture weights using the  $\phi$ -divergence.

Definition 4.1 ( $\phi$ -divergence). Let  $\phi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$  be a convex function on the domain  $\mathbb{R}_+$ ,  $\phi(1) = 0$ ,  $0 \times \phi(a/0) = a \times \lim_{t \uparrow \infty} \phi(t)/t$  for  $a > 0$ , and  $0 \times \phi(0/0) = 0$ . The  $\phi$ -divergence  $\mathbb{D}_{\phi}$  between two probability vectors  $p, \widehat{p} \in \mathbb{R}_+^K$  amounts to  $\mathbb{D}_{\phi}(p \| \widehat{p}) \triangleq \sum_{k \in [K]} \widehat{p}_k \times \phi(p_k / \widehat{p}_k)$ .

The family of  $\phi$ -divergences contains many well-known statistical divergences such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Hellinger distance, etc. Further discussion on this family can be found in Pardo (2018). Distributionally robust optimization models with  $\phi$ -divergence ambiguity set were originally studied in decision-making problems (Ben-Tal et al., 2013; Bayraksan & Love, 2015) and have recently gained attention thanks to their successes in machine learning tasks (Namkoong & Duchi, 2017; Hashimoto et al., 2018; Duchi et al., 2021).

Let  $\varepsilon \geq 0$  be a parameter indicating the uncertainty level of the mixture weights. The uncertainty set for the mixture weights is formally defined as

$$
\Delta \triangleq \left\{p \in [ 0, 1 ] ^ {K}: \mathbb {1} ^ {\top} p = 1, \mathbb {D} _ {\phi} (p \| \widehat {p}) \leq \varepsilon \right\},
$$

which contains all  $K$ -dimensional probability vectors which are of  $\phi$ -divergence at most  $\varepsilon$  from the nominal weights  $\widehat{p}$ . The ambiguity set of the mixture distributions that hedge against the weight misspecification is

$$
\mathcal {U} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}}) \triangleq \left\{\mathbb {Q}: \exists p \in \Delta , \exists \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k})   \forall k \in [ K ] \text {s u c h t h a t} \mathbb {Q} \sim (\mathbb {Q} _ {k}, p _ {k}) \right\},
$$

where the component sets  $\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$  are defined as in Section 3. The DiRRAc problem with respect to the ambiguity set  $\mathcal{U}(\widehat{\mathbb{P}})$  becomes

$$
\min  \sup  _ {\mathbb {P} \in \mathcal {U} (\tilde {\mathbb {P}})} \mathbb {P} (\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0)
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {s . t .} & c (x, x _ {0}) \leq \delta \\ & \sup  _ {\mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k})} \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \left(\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0\right) <   1 \quad \forall k \in [ K ]. \end{array} \tag {7}
$$

It is important to note at this point that the feasible set of (7) coincides with the feasible set of (2). Thus, to resolve problem (7), it suffices to analyze the objective function of (7). Given the function  $\phi$ , we define its conjugate function  $\phi^{*}:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}\cup \{\infty \}$  by

$$
\phi^{*}(s) = \sup_{t\geq 0}\bigl\{ts - \phi (t)\bigr \} .
$$

The next theorem asserts that the worst-case probability under  $\mathcal{U}(\widehat{\mathbb{P}})$  can be computed by solving a convex program.

Theorem 4.2 (Objective value). The feasible set of problem (7) coincides with  $\mathcal{X}$ . Further, for every  $x \in \mathcal{X}$ , the objective value of (7) equals to the optimal value of a convex optimization problem

$$
\sup  _ {\mathbb {P} \in \mathcal {U} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}})} \mathbb {P} (\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0) = \min  _ {\lambda \in \mathbb {R} _ {+}, \eta \in \mathbb {R}} \eta + \varepsilon \lambda + \lambda \sum_ {k \in [ K ]} \widehat {p} _ {k} \phi^ {*} \Big (\frac {f _ {k} (x) - \eta}{\lambda} \Big),
$$

where  $f_{k}(x)$  are computed using Proposition 3.3.

From the result of Theorem 4.2, we can derive the gradient of the objective function of (7) using Danskin's theorem (Shapiro et al., 2009, Theorem 7.21), or simply using auto-differentiation. Furthermore,  $\phi^{*}$  is convex, and thus solving the minimization problem in Theorem 4.2 can be done efficiently using convex optimization algorithms.

# 4.2 MINIMIZING THE WORST-CASE COMPONENT PROBABILITY

Instead of minimizing the (total) probability of unfavorable outcome, we can consider an alternative formulation where the recourse action minimizes the worst-case conditional probability of unfavorable outcome over all  $K$  components. Mathematically, if we opt for the component ambiguity sets

$\mathcal{B}_k(\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k)$  constructed in Section 3, then we can solve

$$
\min  \max  _ {k \in [ K ]} \sup  _ {\mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k})} \mathbb {Q} _ {k} (\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0)
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {s . t .} & c (x, x _ {0}) \leq \delta \\ & \sup  _ {\mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k})} \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \left(\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0\right) <   1 \quad \forall k \in [ K ]. \end{array} \tag {8a}
$$

Interestingly, problem (8a) does not involve the mixture weighs  $\widehat{p}$ . As a consequence, a trivial advantage of this model is that it hedges automatically against the misspecification of  $\widehat{p}$ . To complete, we provide its equivalent finite-dimensional form.

Corollary 4.3 (Component Probability DiRRAc). Problem (8a) is equivalent to

$$
\min  _ {x \in \mathcal {X}} \max  _ {k \in [ K ]} \frac {\rho_ {k} \widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x \| x \| _ {2} + \sqrt {x ^ {\top} \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k} x} \sqrt {(\widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x) ^ {2} + x ^ {\top} \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k} x - \rho_ {k} ^ {2} \| x \| _ {2} ^ {2}}}{(\widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x) ^ {2} + x ^ {\top} \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k} x}. \tag {8b}
$$

# 4.3 GAUSSIAN DIRRAC

We here revisit the Gaussian assumption on the component distributions. We make the temporary assumption that  $\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_k$  are Gaussian for all  $k\in [K]$ , and we will robustify against only the misspecification of the nominal mean vector and covariance matrix  $(\widehat{\theta}_k,\widehat{\Sigma}_k)$ . To do this, we first construct the Gaussian component ambiguity sets

$$
\forall k: \quad \mathcal {B} _ {k} ^ {\mathcal {N}} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k}) \triangleq \left\{\mathbb {Q} _ {k}: \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(\theta_ {k}, \Sigma_ {k}\right), \mathbb {G} \left(\left(\theta_ {k}, \Sigma_ {k}\right), \left(\widehat {\theta} _ {k}, \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k}\right)\right) \leq \rho_ {k} \right\},
$$

where the superscript emphasizes that the ambiguity sets are neighborhoods in the space of Gaussian distributions. The resulting ambiguity set for the mixture distribution is

$$
\mathcal {B} ^ {\mathcal {N}} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}}) = \left\{\mathbb {Q}: \exists \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} ^ {\mathcal {N}} (\widehat {\mathbb {P}} _ {k})   \forall k \in [ K ] \text {s u c h t h a t} \mathbb {Q} \sim (\mathbb {Q} _ {k}, \widehat {p} _ {k}) _ {k \in [ K ]} \right\}.
$$

The Gaussian DiRRAc problem is formally defined as

$$
\min \sup_{\mathbb{Q}\in \mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{N}}(\widehat{\mathbb{P}})}\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal{C}_{\tilde{\theta}}(x) = 0)
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {s . t .} & c (x, x _ {0}) \leq \delta \\ & \sup  _ {\mathbb {Q} _ {k} \in \mathcal {B} _ {k} ^ {\mathcal {N}} (\tilde {\mathbb {P}} _ {k})} \mathbb {Q} _ {k} \left(\mathcal {C} _ {\tilde {\theta}} (x) = 0\right) <   \frac {1}{2} \quad \forall k \in [ K ] \end{array} \tag {9a}
$$

Note that the last constraint in (9a) has margin  $\frac{1}{2}$  instead of 1 as in the DiRRAc problem (2). The next theorem asserts the equivalent form of (9a).

Theorem 4.4 (Gaussian DiRRAc reformulation). The Gaussian DiRRAc problem (9a) is equivalent to the following optimization problem

$$
\min  _ {x \in \mathcal {X}} 1 - \sum_ {k \in [ K ]} \widehat {p} _ {k} \Phi \left(\frac {\left(\widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x\right) ^ {2} - \rho_ {k} ^ {2} \| x \| _ {2} ^ {2}}{\widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x \sqrt {x ^ {\top} \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k} x} + \rho_ {k} \| x \| _ {2} \sqrt {\left(\widehat {\theta} _ {k} ^ {\top} x\right) ^ {2} + x ^ {\top} \widehat {\Sigma} _ {k} x - \rho_ {k} ^ {2} \| x \| _ {2} ^ {2}}}\right). \tag {9b}
$$

# 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we evaluate the performance of our DiRRAc framework on popular benchmarks. We will compare our proposed DiRRAc model (2) and Gaussian DiRRAc model (9a) against two state-of-the-art methods: Actionable Recourse (AR) in linear classification (Ustun et al., 2019) and Model Agnostic Contrastive Explanations (MACE) (Karimi et al., 2020). Throughout, we use  $c(x,x_0) = \| x - x_0\| _2$ . Complementary results and details about the datasets and the experiment setup are provided in Appendix A. All codes and results can be accessed from https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiRRAc-ICLR2022.

Results on synthetic data. We synthesize 2-dimensional data by using  $K = 3$  different shifts similar to Upadhyay et al. (2021): mean shift, covariance shift, and both shifts. First, we fix the

unshifted conditional distributions with  $X|Y = y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_y, \Sigma_y) \forall y \in \mathcal{V}$ . For mean shift, we replace  $\mu_0$  by  $\mu_0^{\mathrm{shift}} = \mu_0 + [\alpha, 0]^\top$ , where  $\alpha$  is a mean shift magnitude. For covariance shift, we replace  $\Sigma_0$  by  $\Sigma_0^{\mathrm{shift}} = (1 + \beta)\Sigma_0$ , where  $\beta$  is a covariance shift magnitude. For mean and covariance shift, we replace  $(\mu_0, \Sigma_0)$  by  $(\mu_0^{\mathrm{shift}}, \Sigma_0^{\mathrm{shift}})$ . We generate 500 samples each class from the unshifted distribution with  $\mu_0 = [-3; -3]$ ,  $\mu_1 = [3; 3]$ , and  $\Sigma_0 = \Sigma_1 = I$ . To estimate  $\widehat{\theta}_k$  and  $\widehat{\Sigma}_k$  for synthetic data, we define valid mixture weights  $\widehat{p}$ , generate data for each component for 100 times with the same ratio as the mixture weight. We train 100 logistic classifiers to compute the empirical mean  $\widehat{\theta}_k$  and the empirical covariance matrix  $\widehat{\Sigma}_k$  for the  $k$ -th component. We generate recourse for each test instance that belongs to negative class. Finally, we compute the empirical validity as the fraction of instances that are still valid with respect to the shifted classifiers. The results in Figure 3 demonstrate that recourse generated by our framework are robust to model shifts, other baselines have low validity with even a small shift magnitude.

Real-world data. We use three real-world datasets which capture different data distribution shifts (Dua & Graff, 2017): (i) the German credit dataset, which captures a correction shift. (ii) the Small Business Administration (SBA) dataset, which captures a temporal shift. (iii) the Student performance dataset, which captures a geospatial shift. Each dataset contains original data and shifted data. We normalize all continuous features to  $[0,1]$ . Similar to Mothilal et al. (2020), we use one-hot encodings for categorical features, then consider them as continuous features in  $[0,1]$ . To ease the comparison, we choose  $K = 1$ . To estimate  $(\widehat{\theta}_1,\widehat{\Sigma}_1)$ , we split randomly  $80\%$  of the original dataset and train a logistic classifier. This process is repeated independently 100 times to obtain 100 observations of the model parameters, then we compute the empirical mean and covariance matrix for  $(\widehat{\theta}_1,\widehat{\Sigma}_1)$ . In parallel, we randomly split 80-20 the shifted dataset 100 times, and each time train a logistic classifier on the training set. This procedure generates 100 future model parameters.

To measure the performance of each method, we do a (80% training, 20% testing) split of the original dataset, train a linear classifier on the training data. and generate recourse for each test instance that is classified as unfavorable. The validity is measured by the empirical validity on the 100 future model parameters, and we also compute the  $l_{1}$  and  $l_{2}$  distance between the recourse and the original instance. The results in Table 1 demonstrate that our DiRRAc have high validity, while keeping the  $l_{2}$  cost low. AR and MACE optimize with  $l_{1}$  cost, and thus have lower  $l_{1}$  cost than our DiRRAc.
