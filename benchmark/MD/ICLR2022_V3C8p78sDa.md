# ABSTRACT

Recent developments in large-scale machine learning suggest that by scaling up data, model size and training time properly, one might observe that improvements in pre-training would transfer favorably to most downstream tasks. In this work we systematically study this phenomena and establish that, as we increase the upstream accuracy, performance of downstream tasks saturates. In particular, we investigate more than 4800 experiments on Vision Transformers, MLP-Mixers and ResNets with number of parameters ranging from ten million to ten billion, trained on the largest scale of available image data (JFT, ImageNet21K) and evaluated on more than 20 downstream image recognition tasks. We propose a model for downstream performance that reflects the saturation phenomena and captures the nonlinear relationship in performance of upstream and downstream tasks. Delving deeper to understand the reasons that give rise to these phenomena, we show that the observed saturation behavior is closely related to the way that representations evolve through the layers of the models. We showcase an even more extreme scenario where performance on upstream and downstream are at odds with each other. That is, in order to have a better downstream performance, we need to hurt upstream accuracy.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Recent impressive progress on transfer and few-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020; Goyal et al., 2021; Kolesnikov et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Dumoulin et al., 2021; Radford et al., 2021) suggests an emerging direction that scaling up models and training them on a huge corpus of data is the main obstacle towards better performance on downstream tasks with less or no data. These developments implicitly encourage two consistent views: 1) scaling up the model and data size improves the performance significantly; 2) the performance improvement transfers to downstream tasks in a desirable way. In a more focused empirical study in support of the first view, Kaplan et al. (2020) show that scaling up the model size, data, and compute appropriately in the language modeling task results in a non-saturating return in performance. Bello et al. (2021), Tan & Le (2019) show that favorable scaling can be achieved in image recognition tasks as well. The second view has also been a subject of recent focused studies. Hernandez et al. (2021) show that favorable scaling laws similar to that of (Kaplan et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2021b) hold in transfer and few-shot settings in NLP tasks. In perhaps closest prior work to ours, Kornblith et al. (2019) observe a linear relationship between the performances on ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) and downstream image recognition tasks.

Adopting the above views has major implications moving forward. These views suggest that spending compute and research effort on improving the performance on one massive corpus would pay off because that would enable us to solve many downstream tasks almost for free. It also means while improving our upstream performance, we do not need to be worried about downstream tasks as their improvement is predictable based on a linear trend. While the aforementioned studies provide a compelling story, they suffer from a major shortcoming: due to compute limitations, performance for different choices of hyper-parameter values are not reported. Scaling plots seem more favorable if the hyper-parameter chosen for each scale is fixed or determined by a simple scaling function.

Figure 1: The performance of different downstream (DS) tasks vs of upstream (US) based on more than 1500 different Vision Transformers, 1400 MLP-Mixers and 16 best performing ResNets (Although the number of ResNet samples are small, this does not hurt our investigations. See Appendix G.1 for details), with different configurations. The models are pre-trained on JFT and evaluated in few-shot settings (25 shots). Figure F.1 in Appendix F shows the same plot but with more than 4800 experiments including two different upstream tasks of JFT, ImageNet21K and 1, 25 shots. We consider the convex hull of the points as well since it captures the performance of a randomized classifier made by choosing these models with different probabilities. As the upstream performance improves, the downstream performance starts to saturate. Even if US accuracy reaches  $100\%$  accuracy, the DS accuracy will not reach the  $100\%$  accuracy and saturates at a lower value. We observe a non-linear relationship between upstream and downstream accuracy and model the relationship with a power law function to predict the DS performance given the US performance. The horizontal line is the predicted downstream accuracy if upstream accuracy reaches  $100\%$ . We investigate DS-vs-US plots instead of the usual DS-vs-scale plots to capture the effect of hyper-parameter choices and to account for the fact that the scaling impacts DS performance through US performance. Figure F.2 depicts the same plot with log scaling of accuracies as done in many related works. Figure F.3 depicts the same plot when upstream is ImageNet21K.

Moreover, often the goal is improving state-of-the-art results, hence naturally most of the efforts in hyper-parameter selection is focused on higher scales, which significantly biases the scaling plots. However, when studying scaling, we are concerned about the best downstream performance of models given all possible values for the hyper-parameters. Additionally, most scaling studies report the behavior within a limited range, and simply extrapolating that scaling without further understanding of the dynamics of scaling can be detrimental as there is no reason, a priori, for the scaling to hold outside of the studied range.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the transferability of improvements on a large-scale upstream task to a wide range of downstream tasks in both few-shot and transfer learning scenarios. To address the above shortcomings, part of our work is a meta-study of more than 4800 Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021) and ResNet (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) models. The models are pre-trained on either JFT (Sun et al., 2017) with 303M images and 18K classes or ImageNet21K (Deng et al., 2009) with 14M images and 21K classes and evaluated on a variety of downstream datasets for few-shot and transfer learning settings. Our 25 downstream tasks cover a wide range of standard datasets that are included in benchmarks like VTAB (Zhai et al., 2019), MetaDataset (Triantafillou et al., 2019), Wilds (Koh et al., 2020) and medical imaging.

We provide strong empirical evidence that scaling (and hyper-parameter tuning) does not lead to a one-model-fits-all solution. There are still many unresolved challenges remaining and at the center is the problem of data diversity for downstream tasks. We provide the first large scale and systematic investigation of this phenomena and discuss the reasons behind it. In Figure 1, we present downstream (DS) vs upstream (US) performance plot on variety of models and downstream tasks. We observe that, as we increase US accuracy, for most cases DS accuracy saturates to a value considerably below  $100\%$ . Also, saturating behavior is not an exception but rather the common trend and it is robust to the choice of number of shots and US tasks (see Figure F.1). We establish that this gap is not due to noise or any other factor that solely depends on DS task; rather, it depends on the relationship between US, DS tasks. Moreover, given a set of models with similar US accuracy, the best model for different DS tasks varies.

Contributions Our main contributions in this paper are as follows:

- We establish through extensive study that as we improve the performance of the upstream (US) task either by scaling up or hyper-parameter and architectural choices, the performance of downstream (DS) tasks shows a saturating behaviour. In our experiments, several DS tasks reach full saturation within the studied range (Section 2).  
- We demonstrate that given a set of models with similar US accuracy, the best model for a DS task  $T_{DS_1}$  might have much worse performance on another DS task  $T_{DS_2}$  compared to the best model for  $T_{DS_2}$  (Figure 5).  
- Given the scale of experiments, it is crucial for the proposed model to not be impacted by the density of the points in the DS-vs-US plot. We argue and demonstrate that fitting the power law to the convex hull of experiments would circumvent the effect of sampling biases on prediction of downstream accuracy and show the robustness of our model to sample size variations (Section 2.2).  
- Having observed the nonlinear relationship between upstream and downstream accuracy, in order to predict downstream performance for a given upstream accuracy, we model their relationship with a power law curve and establish that it captures the behavior well even with small number of samples (Section 2.2).  
- We study how scaling up model size, data size, and compute affects DS performance and show that these parameters impact DS performance mainly through the US performance (Section 3).  
- We investigate reasons behind the DS performance saturation and show that this behavior can be captured by the usefulness of feature representation in higher layers of the pre-trained model (Section 4).  
- We further explore the discrepancy between US and DS performances and show that for some choices of hyper-parameters, they might be at odds with each other. In particular, we showcase how the optimal hyper-parameters for the head used in pre-training (upstream task) are different for US and DS. We then uncover the reason behind this discrepancy (Appendix C, D).  
- Finally, we show our observations are robust to several choices such as size of US data, common scalings of accuracy, number of shots, transfer vs few-shot setting and architecture (Appendix E).

Related Work. The closest work to ours is that of Kornblith et al. (2019). They investigate the effect of ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) pre-training on image classification performance across 12 datasets for few-shot, transfer and random initialization scenarios. They show that performance on ImageNet translates linearly (in logit scaling) to performance on DS tasks. However, they do not consider extrapolation of the values. While both works investigate the effect of pre-training via various experiments, there are two main differences in our responses to the question of "better upstream performance transfer to better downstream performance?". First, we establish that clear "saturation" phenomena exists when looking into DS-vs-US performance. In Figure 1, we see there are various cases when comparing two models, A, B. Where model A has a much higher US accuracy but lower DS accuracy and these are not exceptions to a rule, rather the majority of cases. Essentially, for each DS-vs-US plot two points where one is on the right but lower than the other are instances of such a case. Second, we also establish that, for each DS task you can see best performing models scale with power law as in Equation 1 but for each architecture best performing models are different across DS tasks and this depends on training hyper-parameters, See Figure 5. In other words, when considering two DS tasks,  $T_{DS_1}$ ,  $T_{DS_2}$ , we have numerous cases where model A has better performance on US and  $T_{DS_1}$  but one cannot conclude better performance on  $DS_2$ . We suspect the difference in conclusion is due to the earlier work being limited in the range of accuracy values they consider. In addition to this difference in conclusions, we investigate the reasons behind this saturation behavior. Moreover, (in Appendix C) we consider cases where US and DS performance are at odds with each other, specifically, the scenarios where worse performance on US, leads to performance improvement on DS. Inspired by (Zhai et al., 2021) who noted that increasing head weight decay during pre-training leads to worse performance on US while improving DS performance; we investigate head hyper-parameters (both weight decay and learning rate) further and show that it can be explained by noting that these manipulations push the information stored in the head down to lower layers. Additional related work are covered in Appendix A.

# 1.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The analysis in this paper is based on a study on an exhaustive number of large-scale experiments on image recognition tasks, as well as a set of controlled experiments we conducted to ablate our setup and deepen our understanding of the studied phenomena. We investigate more than 4800 experiments with Vision Transformers, MLP-Mixers and ResNets with different configurations when

pre-trained on a large amount of data in a supervised fashion and evaluated on several downstream image recognition tasks through few-shot learning and fine-tuning. For more details, see Appendix G.

We emphasize that the large set of experiments we investigate are not trained for the purpose of this paper, rather, we have aggregated models trained by different researchers for different purposes to perform a meta-study on them. This, in fact, positions this meta-study in a unique spot. First, it may not be feasible to run such a number of large-scale trials for the purpose of studying particular phenomena. Second, no implicit or explicit assumption was made in these experiments with respect to the type of analysis we conducted on them afterwards, hence minimizing the systematic biases of the analysis process in the findings. We note that, there might potentially be other biases. For example, researchers usually focus on hyper-parameter tuning to improve SOTA on a specific downstream task (usually ImageNet) and this may lead to not do a grid search on high dimensional space of all possible hyper-parameters and possibly affecting the plots. In Section 3, we investigate this and discuss that in this case the observed trend is similar to performing a grid search.

In the main body of the paper, we report the results over eight downstream tasks and provide results for more than 20 downstream tasks in Appendix F. Moreover, the plots corresponding to pre-training on JFT, ImageNet21K are in the main part and Appendix F, respectively.

# 2 THE DIMINISHING BENEFIT OF SCALING UP IN TRANSFER LEARNING

The prominent goal of transfer learning is to have a good performance on downstream tasks. The first question we address is how performance improvement on the upstream task impacts performance on different downstream tasks. We are interested in modeling this effect to facilitate prediction of downstream performance.

# 2.1 RECAP: RANDOMIZED CLASSIFIERS

Before diving deep into the DS-vs-US performance plots, we recap the concept of a randomized classifier since we will be using it extensively throughout this section.

Given two classifiers with US and DS accuracy  $a_1 = (a_1^{US}, a_1^{DS})$ ,  $a_2 = (a_2^{US}, a_2^{DS})$ , one can make a randomized classifier by picking the output of the first classifier with probability  $p_1$  and the output of the second classifier with probability  $1 - p_1$  for each input independently. Then the accuracy of the randomized classifier will be  $p_1 a_1 + (1 - p_1) a_2$ . That is, the randomized classifier's accuracy is the convex combination of accuracy of the two classifiers. By sweeping the value of  $p_1$ , all the points on this convex combination path can be achieved. We can extend this notion to the case of more than two classifiers. As the next lemma states, the accuracy of such a randomized classifier would be a convex combination of accuracies of its endpoints.

Lemma 2.1. Consider a group of models  $\theta_{j}, j \in [N]$  that reach accuracy  $a_{j} = (a_{j}^{US}, a_{j}^{DS})$ ,  $j \in [N]$  on some pair of tasks (US, DS). Construct a randomized model  $\tilde{\theta}$  as follows: for each input  $x_{i}$  with probability  $p_{j}$  pick model  $\theta_{j}$  and output  $\theta_{j}(x_{i})$ . Then the randomized model will demonstrate accuracy  $\sum_{j=1}^{N} p_{j} a_{j}$ .

For proof, see Appendix B.

Therefore, all the points on the convex hull of DS-vs-US accuracy of the trained models are achievable and we have the aforementioned method to reach them. This leads to a randomized classifier that shows the accuracy equivalent to the convex hull of performances of trained classifiers at hand.

Based on the above discussions, in addition to the points corresponding to experiment results, we include the upper hull of the convex hull (representing the highest DS accuracy for every given US accuracy) of the model performances in our analysis. This provides us with a model of DS-vs-US relationship that is robust to density of the points in the plots. We discuss this further in Section 2.2.

# 2.2 SCALING LAWS FOR DOWNSSTREAM ACCURACY

Figure 1 shows DS-vs-US performance for more than  $3K$  experiments where different models are pre-trained on JFT and evaluated on a set of DS tasks in the few-shot setting (25 shots). Figure F.1 in

Appendix F depicts a similar plot with all the 4800 experiments (pre-trained on JFT or ImageNet21K, and for 1, 25 shots). As mentioned in Section 1.1, these models vary in terms of model size and shape, optimization method, compute and other hyper-parameters.

We are interested in predicting how the performance of a DS task will change if US performance improves by investigating the performance of existing models. To do so, we fit a curve to the DS-vs-US performance plot. We emphasize that our analysis differs from earlier works that analyze scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2021) in that it analyzes DS accuracy vs US accuracy, instead of DS accuracy vs dataset size, model size or compute. Since for the most part performance improvement on US is achieved by scaling (dataset size, model size, compute), this approach indirectly captures the impact of scaling. We support this argument in Section 3.

When studying DS-vs-US choosing the right scaling is important. Kornblith et al. (2019) investigate DS-vs-US curve for models that are pre-trained on ImageNet and report a linear DS-vs-US performance when plotting the accuracies in the logit scaling. In Figure F.2, we depict the same experiments to that of Figure 1 but with logit scaling and we note a nonlinear relationship between DS and US accuracies. Recht et al. (2018; 2019) also use logit scaling for investigating relationship between DS and US performance. However, logit scaling shows a symmetric behavior around error 0.5, which is not natural for these problems. Therefore, we argue that log scaling which is used in scaling law literature is more appropriate. A linear relationship between US and DS performance in log scaling can be captured as follows:

$$
e _ {D S} = a \left(e _ {U S}\right) ^ {b}.
$$

Looking at Figure 1, we note that the behavior is not linear. Rather, the performance of DS task saturates at some point and that point varies for different DS tasks.

Performance Saturation: We define the saturation point inspired by the observations in Figure 1 and Figure F.1. Then, we mathematically model and investigate saturation value.

Definition 2.2 (Saturation value). Considering downstream vs upstream accuracy, for a downstream task  $T_{DS}$  saturation value is defined as the value of downstream accuracy as upstream accuracy reaches 1.0.

Considering Definition 2.2, performance saturation also means that there exists a US accuracy value, beyond which the performance improvement on DS is very small and hence it is not worth scaling up data size, compute or model size to improve US accuracy. Since the relationship is not linear, in order to predict DS performance, we need a function form to fit the plot. Inspired by recent work on scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2021), we propose the following function form:

$$
e _ {D S} = k \left(e _ {U S}\right) ^ {\alpha} + e _ {\mathrm {I R}}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $e_{DS}, e_{US}$  refer to the error (1- accuracy) of downstream and upstream respectively,  $k, \alpha$  are constants and  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  is the irreducible error. Irreducible error,  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$ , captures the value of DS error if US error reaches zero and hence acts similar to a bias term.  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  term captures the nonlinearity trend between US, DS accuracies. Meaning that if we plot Equation 1 in log scaling, the dependencies are linear only when  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  is zero.

We sketch the line corresponding to  $1 - e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  in DS-vs-US accuracy plots of Figure 1 and note that it is not close to 1.0 for many DS tasks and better US performance does not transfer to better DS performance in higher US accuracies. We observe that unlike the common belief, the saturating behavior is not an exception, but typical among DS tasks.

Effect of design choices on power law parameters: As we can see in Figure F.1, different DS tasks have different saturating values and this value changes as US task changes. Moreover,  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  changes when we vary the number of shots. To depict this observations more clearly, we plot how different choices affect the parameters of the power law (Equation 1) in Figures 2, F.4, and F.5. It can be seen that the choice of US and DS task affects all parameters, while number of shots mostly impacts  $k$  and  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$ . Specifically, increasing the number of shots results in lower  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$ . In short, there exists some

Figure 3: The effect of sample size on power law curves. The curves are fitted to the convex hull of experiments as well as all data points from Figure F.1. Prediction error is the difference between power law prediction and observed value of the DS accuracy. Fitting error is the difference of power law values from the points that are used in fitting power law parameters. For more details see Appendix F.1.1.

Figure 2: Effect of number of shots and DS/US task on  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  of the power law curves. We note that all of them impact  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$ . To see this effect for all power law parameters see Figures F.4, F.5.

functions  $f_{1}(\cdot), f_{2}(\cdot)$ , and  $f_{3}(\cdot)$  such that for a specific choice of model and training algorithm, we have

$$
\alpha = f _ {1} \left(T _ {U S}, T _ {D S}, d\right), \quad k = f _ {2} \left(T _ {U S}, T _ {D S}, d\right), \quad e _ {\mathrm {I R}} = f _ {3} \left(T _ {U S}, T _ {D S}, d\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $d$  refers to the number of shots in the few-shot setting.

To shed more light into this, we look into correlation of  $k$ ,  $\alpha$ , and  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  with number of shots for different DS, US tasks in Table F.1. For all US and DS choices,  $k$  and  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  correlate negatively with number of shots, while  $\alpha$  is positively correlated with number of shots. However, correlation values change drastically for different choices of US, DS tasks. In addition, we look into the trend of each of these parameters as we increase the number of shots and present the likelihood of binary correlation in Table F.2. Both these tables capture similar phenomena.

Irreducible error is not due to DS Bayes error: We argue that irreducible error,  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$ , is not the Bayes error for DS task. Bayes error for a task refers to the error that is intrinsic to the definition of the task. More specifically, the Bayes error captures whether the classification labels are deterministic, i.e., there is a non-zero probability of a given instance belonging to more than one class. However, as can be seen in Figure F.4, for each DS task,  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  changes significantly by changing the number of shots and choice of US task. Therefore,  $e_{\mathrm{IR}}$  is not merely due to the Bayes error of DS task, but is also influenced by number of available samples from DS and the difference between US and DS tasks.

Choice of data for fitting the power law: As can be seen in Figure 1, there is a large variance in DS-vs-US performance across models. When considering the scaling law of the trained models, earlier works fit a scaling curve to all the existing points. We propose another option. To calculate the convex hull of all trained models and fit a scaling curve to the convex hull. The former essentially fits the scaling curve to average model performance. The latter has the advantage of fitting a scaling curve to the best performing models. The location of the points in the DS-vs-US plot significantly impact the average model and hence the power law prediction. Whereas, a convex hull of points is not affected by the locality of higher density points. A good performing model directly impacts the convex hull with no need to having many such samples. Therefore, we expect the average model to give an incomplete picture of the performance behavior. As we see below, fitting the convex hull is more robust to small sample size. Figure F.6 and F.7, depict the power law (Equation 1) curves corresponding to these two choices respectively. We plot the predictions from the power law curve on the higher US accuracies as well as the ground truth (prediction target) and observe that power law curve closely predicts the performance of DS. See Figure F.8, F.9 for 1 and 25 shot setting.

Sample size sensitivity analysis: We also investigate the robustness of this fit when we change the number of samples, in terms of error encountered when predicting the plot for higher US accuracies as well as the error in fitting the data. We use the points from higher US accuracies as held out data. Prediction error captures the difference between power law prediction and observed value of the DS accuracy. Fitting error captures the difference between power law values and the points that are used in calculating power law parameters. We plot fitting error and prediction error as the number of samples changes. Figures 3, F.10 summarize these errors when fitting the power law curve to the convex hull of DS-vs-US plot, and all data points. For more details, see Appendix F.1 and Figures F.11-F.16. The prediction error is very small across all these choices, which means the proposed model will work well even with smaller number of DS-vs-US samples (trained models). As

(3) The variation from the curve is due to training hyper-parameters. (4) US accuracy has a stronger predictive power for DS accuracy compared to model size, US data size, and compute.

expected, the fitting error decreases by increasing the number of samples. Note that the prediction error is an order of magnitude lower if we fit the power law to the convex hull vs all samples.

# 3 EFFECT OF SCALE: A CLOSER LOOK

In this section, we perform a set of controlled experiments where we increase data size, model size, number of epochs. Figure 4 depicts how DS-vs-US accuracy changes as we increase US dataset size (from  $2\%$  to  $100\%$  of JFT), number of model parameters (ViT-Tiny, ViT-Small, Vit-Base, ViT-Large) and number of epochs (7, 14, and 21 epochs). See Figure F.17 for all 25 DS tasks. Since we are in the under-parametrized regime and far from saturating on JFT, the effect of increasing data size is equivalent to increasing training time and the performance on the US improves as we increase the training time (Nakkiran et al., 2020). In order to facilitate a comparison with earlier experiments, in Figure 4 we overlay the new points (shown in color) to that of Figure 1 (shown in grey).

Similar trend: We observe that the controlled experiments in Figure 4 show similar trends to that of Figure 1, Figure F.1, i.e., the DS-vs-US accuracy presents different trends for different DS tasks when scaling up dataset size, model size and number of epochs. For some DS tasks the performance saturates quicker, for instance, colorectal histology (col_hist) and UC-Merced land use dataset. Furthermore, similar to Figure 1, for some of the DS tasks, the benefit of scaling up diminishes gradually, for instance for Cars (Krause et al., 2013) or Caltech101 (Li et al., 2004).

Grid search equivalence: Effect of model size on improving both US, DS accuracy is more pronounced compared to data size and number of epochs. However, we note that if we keep any two of the three parameters fixed and increase the third one, the points reside on the same curve. In Figure 4 the effect of changing data size and number of epochs are on the same curve to that of changing the model size. Therefore, we can trust that even if we did a grid search on all these parameters, Figure 1 would still present the same picture.

On the prediction power of US accuracy: The above observations show that the effect of each of the three parameters (model size, US data size, compute) on DS accuracy is only through US accuracy. That means, conditioned on US accuracy, none of these three parameters provide extra information on DS accuracy. To depict this further, we evaluate the effectiveness of using US accuracy to predict DS accuracy as follows. Since we have a single value prediction, we consider our prediction based on fitting the power-law of Equation 1 and compare it to using average DS accuracy for predicting DS performance. Figure F.18 plots the error as well as the power law prediction plot for all DS tasks considered in this paper. In addition, we calculate the standard deviation of error (difference between Equation 1's prediction of DS accuracy and the value of DS accuracy) and report in Table F.3. We note that the standard deviation of the error is much smaller than 1 (which is the standard deviation

Figure 5: The overlay of the convex hull of ImageNet (Red) DS-vs-US plot on DS-vs-US plots of all DS tasks from Figure 1(Blue). US task is JFT. We observe that best performing ImageNet models perform very similar to best performing models in several DS tasks but not all of them. Moreover, as the US performance increases, the gap between best performing ImageNet models and best performing DS task models reduces significantly. we would get if we used average as prediction value). This shows that US accuracy has a strong prediction power for DS accuracy and conditioned on US accuracy, there is not much left for the rest of parameters (model size, data size, compute) altogether to predict the DS accuracy. This further confirms our choice of parameter to rely on for predicting DS accuracy.

On the role of hyper-parameters: Moreover, contrary to (Hernandez et al., 2021), these three parameters (data size, model size, number of epochs) are not the only ones that impact the DS accuracy results. When we do controlled experiments on these three parameters, the points end up in the same curve. The variations observed in Figure 1 are due to different architecture and choices of training hyper-parameters and algorithms. The variations caused by the effect of hyper-parameters lead to the points not residing on the same curve in Figure 1. We observe a distance on the points corresponding to controlled experiments from the convex hull (best performing models). For example, for ImageNet, controlled experiments lead to a curve that is close to linear, however, this curve is in the middle of the curve from Figure 1, where in addition to scaling we change hyper-parameters and training details. We discuss the effect of hyper-parameters further in Appendix C.

# 4 INVESTIGATING DIFFERENT DS-VS-US TRENDS

In this section, we investigate the reason behind the saturation behavior in the DS-vs-US accuracy plots and address why saturation happens much earlier for some DS tasks compared to the others. First, we take a closer look at Figure 1 by overlaying convex hulls of different downstream tasks on top of each other. Specifically, we overlay the convex hull of ImageNet DS-vs-US plot on DS-vs-US plots of all DS tasks. Figure 5 and Figure F.19 show this for cases where US task is JFT and ImageNet21K respectively. We observe that (1) Best performing ImageNet models perform very similar to best performing models in several but not all DS tasks. (2) As the US performance increases, the gap between best performing ImageNet models and best performing DS task models reduces significantly. We also depict Spearman correlation between accuracies on different DS tasks, and between DS tasks and US task in Figure F.20 and F.21 respectively. Therefore, as the next step, we focus on capturing the difference between different DS tasks.

As discussed in (Yosinski et al., 2014; Neyshabur et al., 2020), lower layers capture lower level features that are more common across different dataset and tasks, whereas fine-grained features reside at top layers in the network. In addition, examples that are learned in higher layers are learned later in training with lower confidence and higher uncertainty (Baldock et al., 2021). Inspired by these observations, we measure the performance of few-shot classifiers when applied on top of representation from different layers of the pre-trained model. We look into the depth of the earliest layer that leads to the best performance for a given DS task and check whether this is a proxy of the difference between US and DS, and an indicator of how much the DS task will benefit from scaling up the compute or US data size. Figure 6, Figure F.22, F.23 present this result. We notice that, for DS tasks that are similar to US, such as ImageNet, the higher the representation layer the better

Figure 6: The effect of choosing representations from different layers on the downstream tasks performance overlay-ed with the effect of scaling (model, data, and compute) on downstream performance when upstream task is JFT. The red triangles are performance on downstream task when representation used in the few-shot learning is from different layers of the model. The green circles overlay the DS versus US performance of different experiments from Figure 4 on each task. Red triangles use the x-axis on the bottom and the green circles use the x-axis on the top. We note that for those DS tasks that are similar to US, such as ImageNet, the higher the layer the better performance on DS. On the contrary, for those DS tasks that saturate fast, such as UC-Merced and col_hist, the optimal layer is not the last one.

![](images/c585b5243fd5dc37b1484584db1b1e8b1c78f76349e3b9d6984e66102d3dc716.jpg)

performance on DS. On the contrary, for DS tasks that saturate fast, i.e., do not follow performance improvement on US, such as UC-Merced and col_hist, the optimal layer is not the last one. That is, choosing lower layers as the top layer and skipping the rest of the network leads to same or better performance on the DS.

Bringing the two discussions together, performance saturation on DS happens when the pre-trained network lacks the fine-grained features required to perform well on DS. Therefore, one can get similar performance on such DS task when cutting the top layers of the pre-trained model, as seen in Figure 6. Interestingly, as we see in Figure 6, and Figure F.23, when we overlay the DS-vs-US accuracy curves on DS accuracy-vs-layer depth curves, they follow almost exactly the same pattern, which means they are both good proxies for capturing the relation between US and DS tasks.

# 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have investigated the role of scale in few-shot and transfer learning performance in image recognition and have established through extensive study that as we improve the performance of the upstream task either by scaling up or hyper-parameter and architectural choices, the performance of downstream tasks shows a saturating behaviour. In addition, have provided strong empirical evidence that contrary to common narrative, scaling does not lead to a one-model-fits-all solution. We have demonstrated the role of hyper-parameters and emphasize that one cannot hope to find one pre-trained checkpoint that performs well on all possible downstream tasks. We assert that we should refrain from focusing on the performance of only one downstream task, which usually ends up being close to the upstream task. Instead, we should make design choices that improve performance on a breadth of downstream tasks. Moreover, scaling has both monetary and environmental costs (Patterson et al., 2021). We argue that, when investing in terms of scaling in terms of data, model parameters and compute, we should think of an additional axis which is data diversity.

The phenomena we described in the paper is not limited to the setting reported above. In Appendix E, we discuss that the observations are robust to several changes in the setting, namely, number of shots, few-shot vs transfer setting, scaling of plots and architecture.

Our paper focuses on the supervised image recognition task. Extending our investigation to unsupervised pre-training is also of interest. Exploring other modalities, e.g., natural language domain is the subject of future work.
