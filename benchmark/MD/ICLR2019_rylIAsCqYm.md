# ABSTRACT

In this paper, we propose the Asynchronous Accelerated Nonuniform Randomized Block Coordinate Descent algorithm (A2BCD). We prove A2BCD converges linearly to a solution of the convex minimization problem at the same rate as NU_ACDM, so long as the maximum delay is not too large. This is the first asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated algorithm that attains any provable speedup. Moreover, we then prove that these algorithms both have optimal complexity. Asynchronous algorithms complete much faster iterations, and A2BCD has optimal complexity. Hence we observe in experiments that A2BCD is the top-performing coordinate descent algorithm, converging up to  $4 - 5 \times$  faster than NU_ACDM on some data sets in terms of wall-clock time. To motivate our theory and proof techniques, we also derive and analyze a continuous-time analogue of our algorithm and prove it converges at the same rate.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In this paper, we propose and prove the convergence of the Asynchronous Accelerated Nonuniform Randomized Block Coordinate Descent algorithm (A2BCD), the first asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated algorithm that achieves optimal complexity. No previous attempts have been able to prove a speedup for asynchronous Nesterov acceleration. We aim to find the minimizer  $x_{*}$  of the unconstrained minimization problem:

$$
\min  _ {x \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} f (x) = f \left(x _ {(1)}, \dots , x _ {(n)}\right) \tag {1.1}
$$

where  $f$  is  $\sigma$ -strongly convex for  $\sigma > 0$  with  $L$ -Lipschitz gradient  $\nabla f = (\nabla_1 f, \dots, \nabla_n f)$ .  $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$  is composed of coordinate blocks  $x_{(1)}, \ldots, x_{(n)}$ . The coordinate blocks of the gradient  $\nabla_i f$  are assumed  $L_i$ -Lipschitz with respect to the  $i$ th block. That is,  $\forall x, h \in \mathbb{R}^d$ :

$$
\left\| \nabla_ {i} f (x + P _ {i} h) - \nabla_ {i} f (x) \right\| \leq L _ {i} \| h \| \tag {1.2}
$$

where  $P_{i}$  is the projection onto the  $i$ th block of  $\mathbb{R}^d$ . Let  $\bar{L} \triangleq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}L_{i}$  be the average block Lipschitz constant. These conditions on  $f$  are assumed throughout this whole paper. Our algorithm can also be applied to non-strongly convex objectives ( $\sigma = 0$ ) or non-smooth objectives using the black box reduction techniques proposed in Allen-Zhu & Hazan (2016). Hence we consider only the coordinate smooth, strongly-convex case. Our algorithm can also be applied to the convex regularized ERM problem via the standard dual transformation (see for instance Lin et al. (2014)):

$$
f (x) = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} f _ {i} (\langle a _ {i}, x \rangle) + \frac {\lambda}{2} \| x \| ^ {2} \tag {1.3}
$$

Hence A2BCD can be used as an asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated finite-sum algorithm.

Coordinate descent methods, in which a chosen coordinate block  $i_k$  is updated at every iteration, are a popular way to solve equation 1.1. Randomized block coordinate descent (RBCD, Nesterov (2012)) updates a uniformly randomly chosen coordinate block  $i_k$  with a gradient-descent-like step:  $x_{k+1} = x_k - (1 / L_{i_k}) \nabla_{i_k} f(x_k)$ . This algorithm decreases the error  $\mathbb{E}(f(x_k) - f(x_*))$  to  $\epsilon(f(x_0) - f(x_*))$  in  $K(\epsilon) = \mathcal{O}(n(\bar{L} / \sigma) \ln(1 / \epsilon))$  iterations.

Using a series of averaging and extrapolation steps, accelerated RBCD Nesterov (2012) improves RBCD's iteration complexity  $K(\epsilon)$  to  $\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt{\bar{L} / \sigma}\ln (1 / \epsilon))$ , which leads to much faster convergence when  $\frac{\bar{L}}{\sigma}$  is large. This rate is optimal when all  $L_{i}$  are equal Lan & Zhou (2015). Finally, using a special probability distribution for the random block index  $i_k$ , the non-uniform accelerated coordinate descent method Allen-Zhu et al. (2015) (NU_ACDM) can further decrease the complexity to  $\mathcal{O}(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sqrt{L_i / \sigma}\ln (1 / \epsilon))$ , which can be up to  $\sqrt{n}$  times faster than accelerated RBCD, since some  $L_{i}$  can be significantly smaller than  $L$ . NU_ACDM is the current state-of-the-art coordinate descent algorithm for solving equation 1.1.

Our A2BCD algorithm generalizes NU_ACDM to the asynchronous-parallel case. We solve equation 1.1 with a collection of  $p$  computing nodes that continually read a shared-access solution vector  $y$  into local memory then compute a block gradient  $\nabla_{i}f$ , which is used to update shared solution vectors  $(x,y,v)$ . Proving convergence in the asynchronous case requires extensive new technical machinery.

A traditional synchronous-parallel implementation is organized into rounds of computation: Every computing node must complete an update in order for the next iteration to begin. However, this synchronization process can be extremely costly, since the lateness of a single node can halt the entire system. This becomes increasingly problematic with scale, as differences in node computing speeds, load balancing, random network delays, and bandwidth constraints mean that a synchronous-parallel solver may spend more time waiting than computing a solution.

Computing nodes in an asynchronous solver do not wait for others to complete and share their updates before starting the next iteration. They simply continue to update the solution vectors with the most recent information available, without any central coordination. This eliminates costly idle time, meaning that asynchronous algorithms can be much faster than traditional ones, since they have much faster iterations. For instance, random network delays cause asynchronous algorithms to complete iterations  $\Omega (\ln (p))$  time faster than synchronous algorithms at scale. This and other factors that influence the speed of iterations are discussed in Hannah & Yin (2017a). However, since many iterations may occur between the time that a node reads the solution vector, and the time that its computed update is applied, effectively the solution vector is being updated with outdated information. At iteration  $k$ , the block gradient  $\nabla_{i_k}f$  is computed at a delayed iterate  $\hat{y}_k$  defined as<sup>1</sup>:

$$
\hat {y} _ {k} = \left(y _ {(k - j (k, 1))}, \dots , y _ {(k - j (k, n))}\right) \tag {1.4}
$$

for delay parameters  $j(k,1), \ldots, j(k,n) \in \mathbb{N}$ . Here  $j(k,i)$  denotes how many iterations out of date coordinate block  $i$  is at iteration  $k$ . Different blocks may be out of date by different amounts, which is known as an inconsistent read. We assume² that  $j(k,i) \leq \tau$  for some constant  $\tau < \infty$ .

Asynchronous algorithms were proposed in Chazan & Miranker (1969) to solve linear systems. General convergence results and theory were developed later in Bertsekas (1983); Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis (1997); Tseng et al. (1990); Luo & Tseng (1992; 1993); Tseng (1991) for partially and totally

asynchronous systems, with essentially-cyclic block sequence  $i_k$ . More recently, there has been renewed interest in asynchronous algorithms with random block coordinate updates. Linear and sublinear convergence results were proven for asynchronous RBCD Liu & Wright (2015); Avron et al. (2014), and similar was proven for asynchronous SGD Recht et al. (2011), and variance reduction algorithms Reddi et al. (2015); Leblond et al. (2017); Mania et al. (2015); Huo & Huang (2016), and primal-dual algorithms Combettes & Eckstein (2018). Further related work is discussed in Section 4.

# 1.1 SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS

In this paper, we prove that A2BCD attains NU_ACDM's state-of-the-art iteration complexity to highest order for solving equation 1.1, so long as delays are not too large (see Section 2). The proof is very different from that of Allen-Zhu et al. (2015), and involves significant technical innovations and complexity related to the analysis of asynchronicity.

We also prove that A2BCD (and hence NU_ACDM) has optimal complexity to within a constant factor over a fairly general class of randomized block coordinate descent algorithms (see Section 2.1). This extends results in Lan & Zhou (2015) to asynchronous algorithms with  $L_{i}$  not all equal. Since asynchronous algorithms complete faster iterations, and A2BCD has optimal complexity, we expect A2BCD to be faster than all existing coordinate descent algorithms. We confirm with numerical experiments that A2BCD is the current fastest coordinate descent algorithm (see Section 5).

We are only aware of one previous and one contemporaneous attempt at proving convergence results for asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated algorithms. However, the first is not accelerated and relies on extreme assumptions, and the second obtains no speedup. Therefore, we claim that our results are the first-ever analysis of asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated algorithms that attains a speedup. Moreover, our speedup is optimal for delays not too large<sup>3</sup>.

The work of Meng et al. claims to obtain square-root speedup for an asynchronous accelerated SVRG. In the case where all component functions have the same Lipschitz constant  $L$ , the complexity they obtain reduces to  $(n + \kappa)\ln(1/\epsilon)$  for  $\kappa = \mathcal{O}\big(\tau n^2\big)$  (Corollary 4.4). Hence authors do not even obtain accelerated rates. Their convergence condition is  $\tau < \frac{1}{4\Delta^{1/8}}$  for sparsity parameter  $\Delta$ . Since the dimension  $d$  satisfies  $d \geq \frac{1}{\Delta}$ , they require  $d \geq 2^{16}\tau^8$ . So  $\tau = 20$  requires dimension  $d > 10^{15}$ .

In a contemporaneous preprint, authors in Fang et al. (2018) skillfully devised accelerated schemes for asynchronous coordinate descent and SVRG using momentum compensation techniques. Although their complexity results have the improved  $\sqrt{\kappa}$  dependence on the condition number, they do not prove any speedup. Their complexity is  $\tau$  times larger than the serial complexity. Since  $\tau$  is necessarily greater than  $p$ , their results imply that adding more computing nodes will increase running time. The authors claim that they can extend their results to linear speedup for asynchronous, accelerated SVRG under sparsity assumptions. And while we think this is quite likely, they have not yet provided proof.

We also derive a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE), which is the continuous-time limit of A2BCD (see Section 3). This extends the ODE found in Su et al. (2014) to an asynchronous accelerated algorithm minimizing a strongly convex function. We prove this ODE linearly converges to a solution with the same rate as A2BCD's, without needing to resort to the restarting techniques. The ODE analysis motivates and clarifies the our proof strategy of the main result.

# 2 MAIN RESULTS

We should consider functions  $f$  where it is efficient to calculate blocks of the gradient, so that coordinate-wise parallelization is efficient. That is, the function should be "coordinate friendly" Peng et al. (2016b). This is a very wide class that includes regularized linear regression, logistic regression, etc. The  $L^2$ -regularized empirical risk minimization problem is not coordinate friendly in general, however the equivalent dual problem is, and hence can be solved efficiently by A2BCD (see Lin et al. (2014), and Section 5).

To calculate the  $k + 1$ th iteration of the algorithm from iteration  $k$ , we use only one block of the gradient  $\nabla_{i_k}f$ . We assume that the delays  $j(k,i)$  are independent of the block sequence  $i_k$ , but otherwise arbitrary (This is a standard assumption found in the vast majority of papers, but can be relaxed Sun et al. (2017); Leblond et al. (2017); Cannelli et al. (2017)).

Definition 1. Asynchronous Accelerated Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (A2BCD). Let  $f$  be  $\sigma$ -strongly convex, and let its gradient  $\nabla f$  be  $L$ -Lipschitz with block coordinate Lipschitz parameters  $L_{i}$  as in equation 1.2. We define the condition number  $\kappa = L / \sigma$ , and let  $\underline{\mathbf{L}} = \min_{i} L_{i}$ . Using these parameters, we sample  $i_{k}$  in an independent and identically distributed (IID) fashion according to

$$
\mathbb {P} [ i _ {k} = j ] = L _ {j} ^ {1 / 2} / S, \quad j \in \{1, \dots , n \}, \quad \text {f o r} S = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} L _ {i} ^ {1 / 2}. \tag {2.1}
$$

Let  $\tau$  be the maximum asynchronous delay. We define the dimensionless asynchronicity parameter  $\psi$ , which is proportional to  $\tau$ , and quantifies how strongly asynchronicity will affect convergence:

$$
\psi = 9 \left(S ^ {- 1 / 2} \underline {{\mathrm {L}}} ^ {- 1 / 2} L ^ {3 / 4} \kappa^ {1 / 4}\right) \times \tau \tag {2.2}
$$

We use the above system parameters and  $\psi$  to define the coefficients  $\alpha, \beta$ , and  $\gamma$  via eqs. (2.3) to (2.5). Hence A2BCD algorithm is defined via the iterations: eqs. (2.6) to (2.8).

$$
\alpha \triangleq (1 + (1 + \psi) \sigma^ {- 1 / 2} S) ^ {- 1} \tag {2.3}
$$

$$
y _ {k} = \alpha v _ {k} + (1 - \alpha) x _ {k}, \tag {2.6}
$$

$$
\beta \triangleq 1 - (1 - \psi) \sigma^ {1 / 2} S ^ {- 1} \tag {2.4}
$$

$$
x _ {k + 1} = y _ {k} - h L _ {i _ {k}} ^ {- 1} \nabla_ {i _ {k}} f (\hat {y} _ {k}), \tag {2.7}
$$

$$
h \triangleq 1 - \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {1 / 2} \underline {{\mathrm {L}}} ^ {- 1 / 2} \psi . \tag {2.5}
$$

$$
v _ {k + 1} = \beta v _ {k} + (1 - \beta) y _ {k} - \sigma^ {- 1 / 2} L _ {i _ {k}} ^ {- 1 / 2} \nabla_ {i _ {k}} f (\hat {y} _ {k}). \tag {2.8}
$$

See Section A for a discussion of why it is practical and natural to have the gradient  $\nabla_{i_k}f(\hat{y}_k)$  to be outdated, while the actual variables  $x_{k},y_{k},v_{k}$  can be efficiently kept up to date. Essentially it is because most of the computation lies in computing  $\nabla_{i_k}f(\hat{y}_k)$ . After this is computed,  $x_{k},y_{k},v_{k}$  can be updated more-or-less atomically with minimal overhead, meaning that they will always be up to date. However our main results still hold for more general asynchronicity.

A natural quantity to consider in asynchronous convergence analysis is the asynchronicity error, a powerful tool for analyzing asynchronous algorithms used in several recent works Peng et al. (2016a); Hannah & Yin (2017b); Sun et al. (2017); Hannah & Yin (2017a). We adapt it and use a weighted sum of the history of the algorithm with decreasing weight as you go further back in time.

Definition 2. Asynchronicity error. Using the above parameters, we define:

$$
A _ {k} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {\tau} c _ {j} \left\| y _ {k + 1 - j} - y _ {k - j} \right\| ^ {2} \tag {2.9}
$$

$$
\text {f o r} c _ {i} = \frac {6}{S} L ^ {1 / 2} \kappa^ {3 / 2} \tau \sum_ {j = i} ^ {\tau} \left(1 - \sigma^ {1 / 2} S ^ {- 1}\right) ^ {i - j - 1} \psi^ {- 1}. \tag {2.10}
$$

Here we define  $y_{k} = y_{0}$  for all  $k < 0$ . The determination of the coefficients  $c_{i}$  is in general a very involved process of trial and error, intuition, and balancing competing requirements. The algorithm doesn't depend on the coefficients, however; they are only an analytical tool.

We define  $\mathbb{E}_k[X]$  as the expectation of  $X$  conditioned on  $(x_0,\ldots ,x_k)$ ,  $(y_0,\dots ,y_k)$ ,  $(v_{0},\ldots ,v_{k})$ , and  $(i_0,\dots ,i_{k - 1})$ . To simplify notation, we assume that the minimizer  $x_{*} = 0$ , and that  $f(x_{*}) = 0$  with no loss in generality. We define the Lyapunov function:

$$
\rho_ {k} = \left\| v _ {k} \right\| ^ {2} + A _ {k} + c f (x _ {k}) \quad \text {(2 . 1 1)} \quad \text {f o r} c = 2 \sigma^ {- 1 / 2} S ^ {- 1} \left(\beta \alpha^ {- 1} (1 - \alpha) + 1\right). \tag {2.12}
$$

We now present this paper's first main contribution.

Theorem 1. Let  $f$  be  $\sigma$ -strongly convex with a gradient  $\nabla f$  that is  $L$ -Lipschitz with block Lipschitz constants  $\{L_i\}_{i=1}^n$ . Let  $\psi$  defined in equation 2.2 satisfy  $\psi \leq \frac{3}{7}$  (i.e.  $\tau \leq \frac{1}{21} S^{1/2} \underline{L}^{1/2} L^{-3/4} \kappa^{-1/4}$ ). Then for A2BCD we have:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {k} \big [ \rho_ {k + 1} \big ] \leq \Big (1 - (1 - \psi) \sigma^ {1 / 2} S ^ {- 1} \Big) \rho_ {k}.
$$

To obtain  $\mathbb{E}[\rho_k] \leq \epsilon \rho_0$ , it takes  $K_{\mathsf{A2BCD}}(\epsilon)$  iterations for:

$$
K _ {\mathrm {A} 2 \mathrm {B C D}} (\epsilon) = \left(\sigma^ {- 1 / 2} S + \mathcal {O} (1)\right) \frac {\ln (1 / \epsilon)}{1 - \psi}, \tag {2.13}
$$

where  $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$  is asymptotic with respect to  $\sigma^{-1/2}S\to \infty$ , and uniformly bounded.

This result is proven in Section B. A stronger result for  $L_{i} \equiv L$  can be proven, but this adds to the complexity of the proof; see Section E for a discussion. In practice, asynchronous algorithms are far more resilient to delays than the theory predicts.  $\tau$  can be much larger without negatively affecting the convergence rate and complexity. This is perhaps because we are limited to a worst-case analysis, which is not representative of the average-case performance.

Allen-Zhu et al. (2015) (Theorem 5.1) shows a linear convergence rate of  $1 - 2 / \left(1 + 2\sigma^{-1/2}S\right)$  for NU_ACDM, which leads to the corresponding iteration complexity of  $K_{\mathrm{NU\_ACDM}}(\epsilon) = (\sigma^{-1/2}S + \mathcal{O}(1))\ln(1/\epsilon)$ . Hence, we have:

$$
K _ {\mathrm {A 2 B C D}} (\epsilon) = \frac {1}{1 - \psi} (1 + o (1)) K _ {\mathrm {N U} _ {-} \mathrm {A C D M}} (\epsilon)
$$

When  $0 \leq \psi \ll 1$ , or equivalently, when  $\tau \ll S^{1/2} \underline{\mathsf{L}}^{1/2} L^{-3/4} \kappa^{-1/4}$ , the complexity of A2BCD asymptotically matches that of NU_ACDM. Hence A2BCD combines state-of-the-art complexity with the faster iterations and superior scaling that asynchronous iterations allow. We now present some special cases of the conditions on the maximum delay  $\tau$  required for good complexity.

Corollary 3. Let the conditions of Theorem 1 hold. If all coordinate-wise Lipschitz constants  $L_{i}$  are equal (i.e.  $L_{i} = L_{1}, \forall i$ ), then we have  $K_{\mathrm{A2BCD}}(\epsilon) \sim K_{\mathrm{NU\_ACDM}}(\epsilon)$  when  $\tau \ll n^{1/2}\kappa^{-1/4}(L_1/L)^{3/4}$ . If we further assume all coordinate-wise Lipschitz constants  $L_{i}$  equal  $L$ . Then  $K_{\mathrm{A2BCD}}(\epsilon) \sim K_{\mathrm{NU\_ACDM}}(\epsilon) = K_{\mathrm{ACDM}}(\epsilon)$ , when  $\tau \ll n^{1/2}\kappa^{-1/4}$ .

Remark 1. Reduction to synchronous case. Notice that when  $\tau = 0$ , we have  $\psi = 0$ ,  $c_{i} \equiv 0$  and hence  $A_{k} \equiv 0$ . Thus A2BCD becomes equivalent to NU_ACDM, the Lyapunov function<sup>5</sup>  $\rho_{k}$  becomes equivalent to one found in Allen-Zhu et al. (2015)(pg. 9), and Theorem 1 yields the same complexity.

The maximum delay  $\tau$  will be a function  $\tau(p)$  of  $p$ , number of computing nodes. Clearly  $\tau \geq p$ , and experimentally it has been observed that  $\tau = \mathcal{O}(p)$  Leblond et al. (2017). Let gradient complexity

$K(\epsilon, \tau)$  be the number of gradients required for an asynchronous algorithm with maximum delay  $\tau$  to attain suboptimality  $\epsilon$ .  $\tau(1) = 0$ , since with only 1 computing node there can be no delay. This corresponds to the serial complexity. We say that an asynchronous algorithm attains a complexity speedup if  $\frac{pK(\epsilon, \tau(0))}{K(\epsilon, \tau(p))}$  is increasing in  $p$ . We say it attains linear complexity speedup if  $\frac{pK(\epsilon, \tau(0))}{K(\epsilon, \tau(p))} = \Omega(p)$ . In Theorem 1, we obtain a linear complexity speedup (for  $p$  not too large), whereas no other prior attempt can attain even a complexity speedup with Nesterov acceleration.

In the ideal scenario where the rate at which gradients are calculated increases linearly with  $p$ , algorithms that have linear complexity speedup will have a linear decrease in wall-clock time. However in practice, when the number of computing nodes is sufficiently large, the rate at which gradients are calculated will no longer be linear. This is due to many parallel overhead factors including too many nodes sharing the same memory read/write bandwidth, and network bandwidth. However we note that even with these issues, we obtain much faster convergence than the synchronous counterpart experimentally.

# 2.1 OPTIMALITY

NU_ACDM and hence A2BCD are in fact optimal in some sense. That is, among a fairly wide class of coordinate descent algorithms  $\mathcal{A}$ , they have the best-possible worst-case complexity to highest order. We extend the work in Lan & Zhou (2015) to encompass algorithms that are asynchronous and have unequal  $L_{i}$ . For a subset  $S\in \mathbb{R}^d$ , we let  $\operatorname {IC}(S)$  (inconsistent read) denote the set of vectors  $v$  whose components are a combination of components of vectors in the set  $S$ . That is,  $v = (v_{1,1},v_{2,2},\ldots ,v_{d,d})$  for some vectors  $v_{1},v_{2},\ldots ,v_{d}\in S$ . Here  $v_{i,j}$  denotes the  $j$ th component of vector  $v_{i}$ .

Definition 4. Asynchronous Randomized Incremental Algorithms. Consider the unconstrained minimization problem equation 1.1 for function  $f$  satisfying the conditions stated in Section 1. We define the class  $\mathcal{A}$  as algorithms  $G$  on this problem such that:

1. For each parameter set  $(\sigma, L_1, \ldots, L_n, n)$ ,  $G$  has an associated IID random variable  $i_k$  with some fixed distribution  $\mathbb{P}[i_k] = p_i$  for  $\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i = 1$ .  
2. The iterates of  $A$  satisfy:  $x_{k + 1}\in \operatorname {span}\{\operatorname {IC}(X_k),\nabla_{i_0}f(\operatorname {IC}(X_0)),\nabla_{i_1}f(\operatorname {IC}(X_1)),\ldots ,\nabla_{i_k}f(\operatorname {IC}(X_k))\}$

This is a rather general class:  $x_{k + 1}$  can be constructed from any inconsistent reading of past iterates  $\operatorname{IC}(X_k)$ , and any past gradient of an inconsistent read  $\nabla_{i_j}f(\operatorname{IC}(X_j))$ .

Theorem 2. For any algorithm  $G \in \mathcal{A}$  that solves eq. (1.1), and parameter set  $(\sigma, L_1, \ldots, L_n, n)$ , there is a dimension  $d$ , a corresponding function  $f$  on  $\mathbb{R}^d$ , and a starting point  $x_0$ , such that

$$
\mathbb {E} \| x _ {k} - x _ {*} \| ^ {2} / \| x _ {0} - x _ {*} \| ^ {2} \geq \frac {1}{2} \big (1 - 4 / \big (\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \sqrt {L _ {i} / \sigma} + 2 n \big) \big) ^ {k}
$$

Hence  $\mathcal{A}$  has a complexity lower bound:  $K(\epsilon)\geq \frac{1}{4} (1 + o(1))\bigl (\sum_{j = 1}^{n}\sqrt{L_i / \sigma} +2n\bigr)\ln (1 / 2\epsilon)$

Our proof in Section D follows very similar lines to Lan & Zhou (2015); Nesterov (2013).

# 3 ODE ANALYSIS

In this section we present and analyze an ODE which is the continuous-time limit of A2BCD. This ODE is a strongly convex, and asynchronous version of the ODE found in Su et al. (2014). For simplicity, assume  $L_{i} = L$ ,  $\forall i$ . We rescale (i.e. we replace  $f(x)$  with  $\frac{1}{\sigma} f$ )  $f$  so that  $\sigma = 1$ , and hence  $\kappa = L / \sigma = L$ . Taking the discrete limit of synchronous A2BCD (i.e. accelerated RBCD), we can

derive the following ODE $^6$  (see Section equation C.1):

$$
\ddot {Y} + 2 n ^ {- 1} \kappa^ {- 1 / 2} \dot {Y} + 2 n ^ {- 2} \kappa^ {- 1} \nabla f (Y) = 0 \tag {3.1}
$$

We define the parameter  $\eta \triangleq n\kappa^{1/2}$ , and the energy:  $E(t) = e^{n^{-1}\kappa^{-1/2}t}(f(Y) + \frac{1}{4}\left\|Y + \eta\dot{Y}\right\|^2)$ . This is very similar to the Lyapunov function discussed in equation 2.11, with  $\frac{1}{4}\left\|Y(t) + \eta\dot{Y}(t)\right\|^2$  fulfilling the role of  $\|v_k\|^2$ , and  $A_k = 0$  (since there is no delay yet). Much like the traditional analysis in the proof of Theorem 1, we can derive a linear convergence result with a similar rate. See Section C.2.

Lemma 5. If  $Y$  satisfies equation 3.1, the energy satisfies  $E'(t) \leq 0$ ,  $E(t) \leq E(0)$ , and hence:

$$
f (Y (t)) + \frac {1}{4} \left\| Y (t) + n \kappa^ {1 / 2} \dot {Y} (t) \right\| ^ {2} \leq \left(f (Y (0)) + \frac {1}{4} \left\| Y (0) + \eta \dot {Y} (0) \right\| ^ {2}\right) e ^ {- n ^ {- 1} \kappa^ {- 1 / 2} t}
$$

We may also analyze an asynchronous version of equation 3.1 to motivate the proof of our main theorem. Here  $\hat{Y}(t)$  is a delayed version of  $Y(t)$  with the delay bounded by  $\tau$ .

$$
\ddot {Y} + 2 n ^ {- 1} \kappa^ {- 1 / 2} \dot {Y} + 2 n ^ {- 2} \kappa^ {- 1} \nabla f (\hat {Y}) = 0, \tag {3.2}
$$

Unfortunately, this energy satisfies (see Section equation C.4, equation C.7):

$$
e ^ {- \eta^ {- 1} t} E ^ {\prime} (t) \leq - \frac {1}{8} \eta \big \| \dot {Y} \big \| ^ {2} + 3 \kappa^ {2} \eta^ {- 1} \tau D (t), \mathrm {f o r} D (t) \triangleq \int_ {t - \tau} ^ {t} \big \| \dot {Y} (s) \big \| ^ {2} d s.
$$

Hence this energy  $E(t)$  may not be decreasing in general. But, we may add a continuous-time asynchronicity error (see Sun et al. (2017)), much like in Definition 2, to create a decreasing energy. Let  $c_{0} \geq 0$  and  $r > 0$  be arbitrary constants that will be set later. Define:

$$
A (t) = \int_ {t - \tau} ^ {t} c (t - s) \left\| \dot {Y} (s) \right\| ^ {2} d s, \text {f o r} c (t) \triangleq c _ {0} \left(e ^ {- r t} + \frac {e ^ {- r \tau}}{1 - e ^ {- r \tau}} \left(e ^ {- r t} - 1\right)\right).
$$

Lemma 6. When  $r\tau \leq \frac{1}{2}$ , the asynchronicity error  $A(t)$  satisfies:

$$
e ^ {- r t} \frac {d}{d t} \left(e ^ {r t} A (t)\right) \leq c _ {0} \left\| \dot {Y} (t) \right\| ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \tau^ {- 1} c _ {0} D (t).
$$

See Section C.3 for the proof. Adding this error to the Lyapunov function serves a similar purpose in the continuous-time case as in the proof of Theorem 1 (see Lemma 11). It allows us to negate  $\frac{1}{2}\tau^{-1}c_0$  units of  $D(t)$  for the cost of creating  $c_{0}$  units of  $\left\| \dot{Y} (t)\right\| ^2$ . This restores monotonicity.

Theorem 3. Let  $c_0 = 6\kappa^2\eta^{-1}\tau^2$ , and  $r = \eta^{-1}$ . If  $\tau \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{48}} n\kappa^{-1/2}$  then we have:

$$
e ^ {- \eta^ {- 1} t} \frac {d}{d t} (E (t) + e ^ {\eta^ {- 1} t} A (t)) \leq 0. \tag {3.3}
$$

Hence  $f(Y(t))$  convergence linearly to  $f(x_{*})$  with rate  $\mathcal{O}\big(\exp \big(-t / (n\kappa^{1 / 2})\big)\big)$

Notice how this convergence condition is similar to Corollary 3, but a little looser. The convergence condition in Theorem 1 can actually be improved to approximately match this (see Section E).

Proof.

$$
= 6 \eta^ {- 1} \kappa^ {2} \left(\tau^ {2} - \frac {1}{4 8} n ^ {2} \kappa^ {- 1}\right) \| \dot {Y} \| ^ {2} \leq 0
$$

The preceding should hopefully elucidate the logic and general strategy of the proof of Theorem 1.

# 4 RELATED WORK

We now discuss related work that was not addressed in Section 1. Nesterov acceleration is a method for improving an algorithm's iteration complexity's dependence the condition number  $\kappa$ . Nesterov-accelerated methods have been proposed and discovered in many settings Nesterov (1983); Tseng (2008); Nesterov (2012); Lin et al. (2014); Lu & Xiao (2014); Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang (2016); Allen-Zhu (2017), including for coordinate descent algorithms (algorithms that use 1 gradient block  $\nabla_{i}f$  or minimize with respect to 1 coordinate block per iteration), and incremental algorithms (algorithms for finite sum problems  $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x)$  that use 1 function gradient  $\nabla f_{i}(x)$  per iteration). Such algorithms can often be augmented to solve composite minimization problems (minimization for objective of the form  $f(x) + g(x)$ , especially for nonsomooth  $g$ ), or include constraints.

In Peng et al. (2016a), authors proposed and analyzed an asynchronous fixed-point algorithm called ARock, that takes proximal algorithms, forward-backward, ADMM, etc. as special cases. Work has also been done on asynchronous algorithms for finite sums in the operator setting Davis (2016); Johnstone & Eckstein (2018). In Hannah & Yin (2017b); Sun et al. (2017); Peng et al. (2016c); Cannelli et al. (2017) showed that many of the assumptions used in prior work (such as bounded delay  $\tau < \infty$ ) were unrealistic and unnecessary in general. In Hannah & Yin (2017a) the authors showed that asynchronous iterations will complete far more iterations per second, and that a wide class of asynchronous algorithms, including asynchronous RBCD, have the same iteration complexity as their synchronous counterparts. Hence certain asynchronous algorithms can be expected to significantly outperform traditional ones.

In Xiao et al. (2017) authors propose a novel asynchronous catalyst-accelerated Lin et al. (2015) primal-dual algorithmic framework to solve regularized ERM problems. They structure the parallel updates so that the data that an update depends on is up to date (though the rest of the data may not be). However catalyst acceleration incurs a  $\log (\kappa)$  penalty over Nesterov acceleration in general. In Allen-Zhu (2017), the author argues that the inner iterations of catalyst acceleration are hard to tune, making it less practical than Nesterov acceleration.

# 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

To investigate the performance of A2BCD, we solve the ridge regression problem. Consider the following primal and corresponding dual objective (see for instance Lin et al. (2014)):

$$
\min  _ {w \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} P (w) = \frac {1}{2 n} \left\| A ^ {T} w - l \right\| ^ {2} + \frac {\lambda}{2} \| w \| ^ {2}, \min  _ {\alpha \in \mathbb {R} ^ {n}} D (\alpha) = \frac {1}{2 d ^ {2} \lambda} \| A \alpha \| ^ {2} + \frac {1}{2 d} \| \alpha + l \| ^ {2} \tag {5.1}
$$

where  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  is a matrix of  $n$  samples and  $d$  features, and  $l$  is a label vector. We let  $A = [A_1, \ldots, A_m]$  where  $A_i$  are the column blocks of  $A$ . We compare A2BCD (which is asynchronous accelerated), synchronous NU_ACDM (which is synchronous accelerated), and asynchronous RBCD (which is asynchronous non-accelerated). Nodes randomly select a coordinate block according to equation 2.1, calculate the corresponding block gradient, and use it to apply an update to the shared solution vectors. synchronous NU_ACDM is implemented in a batch fashion, with batch size  $p$  (1 block per computing node). Nodes in synchronous NU_ACDM implementation must wait until all nodes apply an update before they can start the next iteration, but the asynchronous algorithms simply compute with the most up-to-date information available.

We use the datasets w1a (47272 samples, 300 features), a congregate file (wxa) from w1a to w8a (293201 samples, 300 features), and aloi (108000 samples, 128 features) from LIBSVM Chang & Lin (2011). The algorithm is implemented in a multi-threaded fashion using C++11 and GNU Scientific Library with a shared memory architecture. We use 40 threads on two 2.5GHz 10-core Intel Xeon

E5-2670v2 processors. See Section A.1 for a discussion of parameter tuning and estimation. The parameters for each algorithm are tuned to give the fastest performance, so that a fair comparison is possible.

A critical ingredient in the efficient implementation of A2BCD and NU_ACDM for this problem is the efficient update scheme discussed in Lee & Sidford (2013b;a). In linear regression applications such as this, it is essential to be able to efficiently maintain or recover  $Ay$ . This is because calculating block gradients requires the vector  $A_i^T Ay$ , and without an efficient way to recover  $Ay$ , block gradient evaluations are essentially  $50\%$  as expensive as full-gradient calculations. Unfortunately, every accelerated iteration results in dense updates to  $y_k$  because of the averaging step in equation 2.6. Hence  $Ay$  must be recalculated from scratch.

However Lee & Sidford (2013a) introduces a linear transformation that allows for an equivalent iteration that results in sparse updates to new iteration variables  $p$  and  $q$ . The original purpose of this transformation was to ensure that the averaging steps (e.g. equation 2.6) do not dominate the computational cost for sparse problems. However we find a more important secondary use which applies to both sparse and dense problems. Since the updates to  $p$  and  $q$  are sparse coordinate-block updates, the vectors  $A p$ , and  $A q$  can be efficiently maintained, and therefore block gradients can be efficiently calculated. The specifics of this efficient implementation are discussed in Section A.2.

In Table 5, we plot the sub-optimality vs. time for decreasing values of  $\lambda$ , which corresponds to increasingly large condition numbers  $\kappa$ . When  $\kappa$  is small, acceleration doesn't result in a significantly better convergence rate, and hence A2BCD and async-RBCD both outperform sync-NU_ACDM since they complete faster iterations at similar complexity. Acceleration for low  $\kappa$  has unnecessary overhead, which means async-RBCD can be quite competitive. When  $\kappa$  becomes large, async-RBCD is no longer competitive, since it has a poor convergence rate. We observe that A2BCD and sync-NU_ACDM have essentially the same convergence rate, but A2BCD is up to  $4 - 5\times$  faster than sync-NU_ACDM because it completes much faster iterations. We observe this advantage despite the fact that we are in an ideal environment for synchronous computation: A small, homogeneous, high-bandwidth, low-latency cluster. In large-scale heterogeneous systems with greater synchronization overhead, bandwidth constraints, and latency, we expect A2BCD's advantage to be much larger.
