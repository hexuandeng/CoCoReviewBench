# ABSTRACT

In adversarial machine learning, there was a common belief that robustness and accuracy hurt each other. The belief was challenged by recent studies where we can maintain the robustness and improve the accuracy. However, the other direction, whether we can keep the accuracy while improving the robustness, is conceptually and practically more interesting, since robust accuracy should be lower than standard accuracy for any model. In this paper, we show this direction is also promising. Firstly, we find even over-parameterized deep networks may still have insufficient model capacity, because adversarial training has an overwhelming smoothing effect. Secondly, given limited model capacity, we argue adversarial data should have unequal importance: geometrically speaking, a natural data point closer to/farther from the class boundary is less/more robust, and the corresponding adversarial data point should be assigned with larger/smaller weight. Finally, to implement the idea, we propose geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversarial training, where the weights are based on how difficult it is to attack a natural data point. Experiments show that our proposal boosts the robustness of standard adversarial training; combining two directions, we improve both robustness and accuracy of standard adversarial training.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Crafted adversarial data can easily fool the standard-trained deep models by adding human-imperceptible noise to the natural data, which leads to the security issue in applications such as medicine, finance, and autonomous driving (Szegedy et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015). To mitigate this issue, many adversarial training methods employ the most adversarial data maximizing the loss for updating the current model such as standard adversarial training (AT) (Madry et al., 2018), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019), robust self-training (RST) (Carmon et al., 2019), and MART (Wang et al., 2020). The adversarial training methods seek to train an adversially robust deep model whose predictions are locally invariant to a small neighborhood of its inputs (Papernot et al., 2016). By leveraging adversarial data to smooth the small neighborhood, the adversarial training methods acquire adversarial robustness against adversarial data but often lead to the undesirable degradation of standard accuracy on natural data (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019).

Thus, there have been debates on whether there exists a trade-off between robustness and accuracy. For example, Tsipras et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2019) argued an inevitable trade-off: Tsipras et al. (2019) showed fundamentally different representations learned by a standard-trained model and an adversarial-trained model; Zhang et al. (2019) proposed an adversarial training method TRADES that can trade off standard accuracy for adversarial robustness. On the other hand, Raghunathan et al. (2020) and Yang et al. (2020) argued that there is no such the trade-off: Raghunathan et al. (2020) showed infinite data could eliminate this trade-off; Yang et al. (2020) showed benchmark image datasets are class-separated.

Recently, emerging adversarial training methods have empirically challenged this trade-off. For example, Zhang et al. (2020b) proposed the friendly adversarial training method (FAT), employing friendly adversarial data minimizing the loss given that some wrongly-predicted adversarial data have been found. Yang et al. (2020) introduced dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) into existing AT, RST, and TRADES methods. Both methods can improve the accuracy while maintaining the ro

Figure 1: The illustration of GAIRAT. GAIRAT explicitly gives larger weights on the losses of adversarial data (larger red), whose natural counterparts are closer to the decision boundary (lighter blue). GAIRAT explicitly gives smaller weights on the losses of adversarial data (smaller red), whose natural counterparts are farther away from the decision boundary (darker blue). The examples of two toy datasets and the CIFAR-10 dataset refer to Figure 3.

bustness. However, the other direction, whether we can retain the accuracy while improving the robustness, remains unsolved and is more interesting.

In this paper, we show this direction is also promising. Firstly, we show over-parameterized deep networks may still have insufficient model capacity, because adversarial training has an overwhelming smoothing effect. Fitting adversarial data is demanding for a tremendous model capacity: It requires a large number of trainable parameters or long-enough training epochs to reach near-zero error on the adversarial training data (see Figure 2). The over-parameterized models that fit natural data entirely in the standard training (Zhang et al., 2017) are still far from enough for fitting adversarial data. Compared with standard training fitting the natural data points, adversarial training smoothes the neighborhoods of natural data, so that adversarial data consume significantly more model capacity than natural data. Thus, adversarial training methods should carefully utilize the limited model capacity to fit the neighborhoods of the important data that aid to fine-tune the decision boundary. Therefore, it may be unwise to give equal weights to all adversarial data.

Secondly, data along with their adversarial variants are not equally important. Some data are geometrically far away from the class boundary. They are relatively guarded. Their adversarial variants are hard to be misclassified. On the other hand, some data are close to the class boundary. They are relatively attackable. Their adversarial variants are easily misclassified (see Figure 3). As the adversarial training progresses, the adversarially robust model engenders an increasing number of guarded training data and a decreasing number of attackable training data. Given limited model capacity, treating all data equally may cause the vast number of adversarial variants of the guarded data to overwhelm the model, leading to the undesirable robust overfitting (Rice et al., 2020). Thus, it may be pessimistic to treat all data equally in adversarial training.

To ameliorate this pessimism, we propose a heuristic method, i.e., geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversarial training (GAIRAT). As shown in Figure 1, GAIRAT treats data differently. Specifically, for updating the current model, GAIRAT gives larger/smaller weight to the loss of an adversarial variant of attackable/guarded data point which is more/less important in fine-tuning the decision boundary. An attackable/guarded data point has a small/large geometric distance, i.e., its distance from the decision boundary. We approximate its geometric distance by the least number of iterations  $\kappa$  that projected gradient descent method (Madry et al., 2018) requires to generate a misclassified adversarial variant (see the details in Section 3.3). GAIRAT explicitly assigns instance-dependent weight to the loss of its adversarial variant based on the least iteration number  $\kappa$ .

Our contributions are as follows. (a) In adversarial training, we identify the pessimism in treating all data equally, which is due to the insufficient model capacity and the unequal nature of different data (in Section 3.1). (b) We propose a new adversarial training method, i.e., GAIRAT (its learning objective in Section 3.2 and its realization in Section 3.3). GAIRAT is a general method: Besides standard AT (Madry et al., 2018), the existing adversarial training methods such as FAT (Zhang et al., 2020b) and TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019) can be modified to GAIR-FAT and GAIR-TRADES (in Appendices B.1 and B.2, respectively). (c) Empirically, our GAIRAT can relieve the issue of robust overfitting (Rice et al., 2020), meanwhile leading to the improved robustness with zero or little degradation of accuracy (in Section 4.1 and Appendix C.1). Besides, we use Wide ResNets (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) to corroborate the efficacy of our geometry-aware instance-reweighted methods: Our GAIRAT significantly boosts the robustness of standard AT; combined with FAT, our GAIR-FAT improves both the robustness and accuracy of standard AT (in Section 4.2). Consequently, we conjecture no inevitable trade-off between robustness and accuracy.

# 2 ADVERSARIAL TRAINING

In this section, we review adversarial training methods (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020b).

# 2.1 LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Let  $(\mathcal{X},d_{\infty})$  denote the input feature space  $\mathcal{X}$  with the infinity distance metric  $d_{\mathrm{inf}}(x,x^{\prime}) = \| x - x^{\prime}\|_{\infty}$ , and  $\mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}[x] = \{x^{\prime}\in \mathcal{X}\mid d_{\mathrm{inf}}(x,x^{\prime})\leq \epsilon \}$  be the closed ball of radius  $\epsilon >0$  centered at  $x$  in  $\mathcal{X}$ . Dataset  $S = \{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n$ , where  $x_{i}\in \mathcal{X}$  and  $y_{i}\in \mathcal{V} = \{0,1,\dots,C - 1\}$ .

The objective function of standard adversarial training (AT) (Madry et al., 2018) is

$$
\min  _ {f _ {\theta} \in \mathcal {F}} \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \ell \left(f _ {\theta} \left(\tilde {x} _ {i}\right), y _ {i}\right), \tag {1}
$$

where

$$
\tilde {x} _ {i} = \arg \max  _ {\tilde {x} \in \mathcal {B} _ {\varepsilon} [ x _ {i} ]} \ell \left(f _ {\theta} (\tilde {x}), y _ {i}\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $\tilde{x}$  is the most adversarial data within the  $\epsilon$ -ball centered at  $x$ ,  $f_{\theta}(\cdot): \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^{C}$  is a score function, and the loss function  $\ell: \mathbb{R}^{C} \times \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}$  is a composition of a base loss  $\ell_{\mathrm{B}}: \Delta^{C-1} \times \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}$  (e.g., the cross-entropy loss) and an inverse link function  $\ell_{\mathrm{L}}: \mathbb{R}^{C} \to \Delta^{C-1}$  (e.g., the soft-max activation), in which  $\Delta^{C-1}$  is the corresponding probability simplex—in other words,  $\ell(f_{\theta}(\cdot), y) = \ell_{\mathrm{B}}(\ell_{\mathrm{L}}(f_{\theta}(\cdot)), y)$ . AT employs the most adversarial data generated according to Eq. (2) for updating the current model.

The objective function of friendly adversarial training (FAT) (Zhang et al., 2020b) is

$$
\tilde {x} _ {i} = \underset {\tilde {x} \in \mathcal {B} _ {\epsilon} [ x _ {i} ]} {\arg \min } \ell \left(f _ {\theta} (\tilde {x}), y _ {i}\right) \text {s . t .} \ell \left(f _ {\theta} (\tilde {x}), y _ {i}\right) - \underset {y \in \mathcal {Y}} {\min } \ell \left(f _ {\theta} (\tilde {x}), y\right) \geq \rho . \tag {3}
$$

Note that the outer minimization remains the same as Eq. (1), and the operator  $\arg \max$  is replaced by  $\arg \min$ .  $\rho$  is a margin of loss values (i.e., the misclassification confidence). The constraint of Eq. (3) firstly ensures  $\tilde{x}$  is misclassified, and secondly ensures for  $\tilde{x}$  the wrong prediction is better than the desired prediction  $y_{i}$  by at least  $\rho$  in terms of the loss value. Among all such  $\tilde{x}$  satisfying the constraint, Eq. (3) selects the one minimizing  $\ell(f_{\theta}(\tilde{x}), y_{i})$  by a violation of the value  $\rho$ . There are no constraints on  $\tilde{x}_{i}$  if  $\tilde{x}_{i}$  is correctly classified. FAT employs the friendly adversarial data generated according to Eq. (3) for updating the current model.

# 2.2 REALIZATIONS

AT and FAT's objective functions imply the optimization of adversarially robust networks, with one step generating adversarial data and one step minimizing loss on the generated adversarial data w.r.t. the model parameters  $\theta$ .

The projected gradient descent method (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) is the most common approximation method for searching adversarial data. Given a starting point  $x^{(0)} \in \mathcal{X}$  and step size  $\alpha > 0$ , PGD works as follows:

$$
x ^ {(t + 1)} = \Pi_ {\mathcal {B} [ x ^ {(0)} ]} \left(x ^ {(t)} + \alpha \operatorname {s i g n} \left(\nabla_ {x ^ {(t)}} \ell \left(f _ {\theta} \left(x ^ {(t)}, y\right)\right)\right), t \in \mathbb {N} \right. \tag {4}
$$

until a certain stopping criterion is satisfied.  $\ell$  is the loss function;  $x^{(0)}$  refers to natural data or natural data perturbed by a small Gaussian or uniformly random noise;  $y$  is the corresponding label for natural data;  $x^{(t)}$  is adversarial data at step  $t$ ; and  $\Pi_{\mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}[x_0]}(\cdot)$  is the projection function that projects the adversarial data back into the  $\epsilon$ -ball centered at  $x^{(0)}$  if necessary.

There are different stopping criteria between AT and FAT. AT employs a fixed number of iterations  $K$ , namely, the PGD-  $K$  algorithm (Madry et al., 2018), which is commonly used in many adversarial training methods such as CAT (Cai et al., 2018), DAT (Wang et al., 2019), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019), and MART (Wang et al., 2020). On the other hand, FAT employs the misclassification-aware criterion. For example, Zhang et al. (2020b) proposed the early-stopped PGD-  $K - \tau$  algorithm ( $\tau \leq K$ ;  $K$  is the fixed and maximally allowed iteration number): Once the PGD-  $K - \tau$  finds the current

![](images/e9dbcb4b5b69331da67cc224675b999e3a4743e8ef5d45db98dbe1a5e29b19c8.jpg)

model misclassifying the adversarial data, it stops the iterations immediately ( $\tau = 0$ ) or slides a few more steps ( $\tau > 0$ ). This misclassification-aware criterion is used in the emerging adversarial training methods such as MMA (Ding et al., 2020), FAT (Zhang et al., 2020b), ATES (Sitawarin et al., 2020), and Customized AT (Cheng et al., 2020).

AT can enhance the robustness against adversarial data but, unfortunately, degrades the standard accuracy on the natural data significantly (Madry et al., 2018). On the other hand, FAT has better standard accuracy with near-zero or little degradation of robustness (Zhang et al., 2020b).

Nevertheless, both AT and FAT treat the generated adversarial data equally for updating the model parameters, which is not necessary and sometimes even pessimistic. In the next sections, we introduce our method GAIRAT, which is compatible with existing methods such as AT, FAT, and TRADES. Consequently, GAIRAT can significantly enhance robustness with little or even zero degradation of standard accuracy.

# 3 GEOMETRY-AWAREINSTANCE-REWEIGHTEDADVERSARIAL TRAINING

In this section, we propose geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversarial training (GAIRAT) and its learning objective as well as its algorithmic realization.

# 3.1 MOTIVATIONS OF GAIRAT

Model capacity is often insufficient in adversarial training. In the standard training, the overparameterized networks, e.g., ResNet-18 and even larger ResNet-50, have more than enough model capacity, which can easily fit the natural training data entirely (Zhang et al., 2017). However, the left panel of Figure 2 shows that the model capacity of those over-parameterized networks is not enough for fitting the adversarial data. Under the computational budget of 100 epochs, the networks hardly reach zero error on the adversarial training data. Besides, adversarial training error only decreases by a small constant factor with the significant increase of the model's parameters. Even worse, a slightly larger perturbation bound  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{train}}$  significantly uncovers this insufficiency of the model capacity (right panel): Adversarial training error significantly increases with slightly larger  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{train}}$ . Surprisingly, the standard training error on natural data hardly reaches zero with  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{train}} = 16 / 255$ .

Adversarial training methods employ the adversarial data to reduce the sensitivity of the model's output w.r.t. small changes of the natural data (Papernot et al., 2016). During the training process, adversarial data are generated on the fly and are adaptively changed based on the current model to smooth the natural data's local neighborhoods. The volume of this surrounding is exponentially  $(|1 + \epsilon_{\mathrm{train}}|^{|\mathcal{X}|})$  large w.r.t. the input dimension  $|\mathcal{X}|$ , even if  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{train}}$  is small. Thus, this smoothness consumes significant model capacity. In adversarial training, we should carefully leverage the limited model capacity by fitting the important data and by ignoring the unimportant data.

More attackable/guarded data are closer to/farther away from the decision boundary. We can measure the importance of the data by their robustness against adversarial attacks. Figure 3 shows that the robustness (more attackable or more guarded) of the data is closely related to their geometric distance from the decision boundary. From the geometry perspective, more attackable

Figure 3: More attackable data (lighter red and blue) are closer to the decision boundary; more guarded data (darker red and blue) are farther away from the decision boundary. Left panel: Two toy examples. Right panel: The model's output distribution of two randomly selected classes from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The degree of robustness (denoted by the color gradient) of a data point is calculated based on the least number of iterations  $\kappa$  that PGD needs to find its misclassified adversarial variant.

![](images/2f6c92ea9c6047e0942a0bffe9e459aadfb2f013716fc144762c872d940acba6.jpg)

data are closer to the decision boundary whose adversarial variants are more important to fine-tune the decision boundary for enhancing robustness.

Appendix A contains experimental details of Figures 2 and 3 and more motivation figures.

# 3.2 LEARNING OBJECTIVE OF GAIRAT

Let  $\omega(x, y)$  be the geometry-aware weight assignment function on the loss of adversarial variant  $\tilde{x}$ . The inner optimization for generating  $\tilde{x}$  still follows Eq. (2) or Eq. (3). The outer minimization is

$$
\min  _ {f _ {\theta} \in \mathcal {F}} \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \omega \left(x _ {i}, y _ {i}\right) \ell \left(f _ {\theta} \left(\tilde {x} _ {i}\right), y _ {i}\right). \tag {5}
$$

The constraint firstly ensures that  $y_{i} = \arg \max_{i}f_{\theta}(x_{i})$  and secondly ensures that  $\omega (x_{i},y_{i})$  is a non-increasing function w.r.t. the geometric distance, i.e., the distance from data  $x_{i}$  to the decision boundary, in which  $\omega (x_{i},y_{i})\geq 0$  and  $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\omega (x_i,y_i) = 1$ .

There are no constraints when  $y_{i} \neq \arg \max_{i} f_{\theta}(x)$ : for those  $x$  significantly far away from the decision boundary, we may discard them (outliers); for those  $x$  close to the decision boundary, we may assign them large weights. In this paper, we do not consider outliers, and therefore we assign large weight to the losses of adversarial data, whose natural counterparts are misclassified. Figure 1 provides an illustrative schematic of the learning objective of GAIRAT.

A burn-in period may be introduced, i.e., during the initial period of the training epochs,  $\omega (x_{i},y_{i}) = 1$  regardless of the geometric distance of input  $(x_{i},y_{i})$ , because the geometric distance is less informative initially, when the classifier is not properly learned.

Relation with traditional machine learning methods. The abstract concept of GAIRAT has appeared previously. For example, in the support vector machine (SVM), support vectors near the decision boundary are particularly useful in influencing the decision boundary (Hearst et al., 1998). For learning models, the magnitude of the loss function (e.g., the hinge loss and the logistic loss) can naturally capture different data's geometric distance from the decision boundary. For updating the model, the loss function treats data differently by incurring large losses on important attackable (close to the decision boundary) and misclassified data and incurring zero or very small losses on unimportant guarded (far away from the decision boundary) data.

However, in adversarial training, it is critical to explicitly assign different weights on top of losses on different adversarial data due to the blocking effect. The model trained on the adversarial data that maximize the loss learns to prevent generating large-loss adversarial data. This blocking effect makes the magnitude of the loss less capable of distinguishing important adversarial data from unimportant ones for updating the model parameters, compared with the role of loss on measuring the natural data's importance in standard training. Our GAIRAT breaks this blocking effect by explicitly extracting geometric distance information to aid in distinguishing the importance of the different adversarial data.

# 3.3 REALIZATION OF GAIRAT

The learning objective Eq. (5) implies the optimization of an adversarially robust network, with one step generating adversarial data and then reweighting loss on them according to the geometric distance of their natural counterparts, and one step minimizing the reweighted loss w.r.t. the model parameters  $\theta$ .

We approximate the geometric distance of a data point  $(x,y)$  by the least iteration numbers  $\kappa (x,y)$  that the PGD method needs to generate a adversarial variant  $\tilde{x}$  to fool the current network, given the maximally allowed iteration number  $K$  and step size  $\alpha$ . Thus, the geometric distance is approximated by  $\kappa$  (precisely by  $\kappa \times \alpha$ ). Thus, the value of the weight function  $\omega$  should be non-increasing w.r.t.  $\kappa$ . We name  $\kappa (x,y)$  the geometry value of data  $(x,y)$ .

How to calculate the optimal  $\omega$  is still an open question; therefore, we heuristically design different non-increasing functions  $\omega$ . We give one example here and discuss more examples in Appendix C.3 and Section 4.1.

$$
w (x, y) = \frac {\left(1 + \tanh  (\lambda + 5 \times (1 - 2 \times \kappa (x , y) / K))\right)}{2}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\kappa /K\in [0,1],K\in \mathbb{N}^{+}$ , and  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ . If  $\lambda = +\infty$ , GAIRAT recovers the standard AT (Madry et al., 2018), assigning equal weights to the losses of adversarial data.

Algorithm 1 is a geometry-aware PGD method (GA-PGD), which returns both the most adversarial data and the geometry value of its natural counterpart. Algorithm 2 is geometry-aware instance-dependent adversarial training (GAIRAT). GAIRAT leverages Algorithms 1 for obtaining the adversarial data and the geometry value. For each mini-batch, GAIRAT reweighs the loss of adversarial data  $(\tilde{x}_i, y_i)$  according to the geometry value of their natural counterparts  $(x_i, y_i)$ , and then updates the model parameters by minimizing the sum of the reweighted loss.

GAIRAT is a general method. Indeed, FAT (Zhang et al., 2020b) and TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019) can be modified to GAIR-FAT and GAIR-TRADES (see Appendices B.1 and B.2, respectively).

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we empirically justify the efficacy of GAIRAT. Section 4.1 shows that GAIRAT can relieve the undesirable robust overfitting (Rice et al., 2020) of the minimax-based adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018). In Section 4.2, we benchmark our GAIRAT and GAIR-FAT using Wide ResNets and compare them with AT and FAT.

In our experiments, we consider  $||\tilde{x} - x||_{\infty} \leq \epsilon$  with the same  $\epsilon$  in both training and evaluations. All images of CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) and SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011) are normalized into  $[0,1]$ .

# 4.1 GAIRAT RELIEVES ROBUST OVERFITTING

In Figure 4, we conduct the standard AT (all red lines) using ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) on CIFAR-10 dataset. For generating the most adversarial data for updating the model, the perturbation bound  $\epsilon = 8 / 255$ ; the PGD steps number  $K = 10$  with step size  $\alpha = 2 / 255$ , which keeps the same as Rice et al. (2020). We train ResNet-18 using SGD with 0.9 momentum for 100 epochs with the initial learning rate of 0.1 divided by 10 at Epoch 30 and 60, respectively. At each training epoch, we collect the training statistics, i.e., the geometry value  $\kappa(x,y)$  of each training data, standard/robust training and test error, the flatness of loss w.r.t. adversarial test data. The detailed descriptions of those statistics and the evaluations are in the Appendix C.1.

Bottom-left panel of Figure 4 shows geometry value  $\kappa$  of training data of standard AT. Over the training progression, there is an increasing number of guarded training data with a sudden leap when the learning rate decays to 0.01 at Epoch 30. After Epoch 30, the model steadily engenders a increasing number of guarded data whose adversarial variants are correctly classified. Learning from those correctly classified adversarial data (large portion) will reinforce the existing knowledge and spare little focus on wrongly predicted adversarial data (small portion), thus leading to the robust overfitting. The robust overfitting is manifested by red (dashed and solid) lines in upper-middle and upper-right and bottom-middle and bottom-right panels.

To avoid the large portion of guarded data overwhelming the learning from the rare attackable data, our GAIRAT explicitly give small weights to the losses of adversarial variants of the guarded data. Blue  $(\omega_{2})$  and yellow  $(\omega_{3})$  lines in bottom-left panel gives two types of weight assignment functions that assign instance-dependent weight on the loss based on the geometry value  $\kappa$ . In GAIRAT, the model is forced to give enough focus on those rare attackable data.

In GAIRAT, the initial 30 epochs is burn-in period, and we introduce the instance-dependent weight assignment  $\omega$  from Epoch 31 onward (both blue and yellow lines in Figure 4). The rest of hyperparameters keeps the same as AT (red lines). From the upper-right panel, GAIRAT (both yellow and blue lines) achieves smaller error on adversarial test data and larger error on training adversarial data, compared with standard AT (red lines). Therefore, our GAIRAT can relieve the issue of the robust overfitting.

Besides, Appendix C contains more experiments such as different learning rate schedules, different choices of weight assignment functions  $\omega$ , different lengths of burn-in period, a different dataset (SVHN) and a different network (Small CNN), which justify the efficacy of our GAIRAT. Notably, In Appendix C.6, we show and discuss the effects of GAIR-FAT on improving FAT.

We employ the large-capacity network, i.e., Wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), on the CIFAR-10 dataset. In Table 1, we compare the performance of the standard AT (Madry et al., 2018), FAT (Zhang et al., 2020b), GAIRAT and GAIR-FAT. We use WRN-32-10 that keeps the same as Madry et al. (2018). We compare different methods on the best checkpoint model (suggested by Rice et al. (2020)) and the last checkpoint model (used by Madry et al. (2018)), respectively. Note that results in Zhang et al. (2020b) only compare the last checkpoint between AT and FAT; instead, we also include the best checkpoint comparisons. We evaluate the robust models based on the three evaluation metrics, i.e., standard test accuracy on natural data (Natural), robust test accuracy on adversarial data generated by PGD-20 and PGD+. PGD+ is PGD with five random starts, and each start has 40 steps with step size 0.01, which keeps the same as Carmon et al. (2019) (PGD+ has  $40 \times 5 = 200$  iterations for each test data). We run AT, FAT, GAIRAT, and GAIR-FAT five repeated trials with different random seeds. Table 1 reports the medians and standard deviations of the results. Besides, we treat the results of AT as the baseline and report the difference (Diff.) of the test accuracies. The detailed training settings and evaluations are in Appendix C.7. Besides, we also compare TRADES and GAIR-TRADES using WRN-34-10, which is in the Appendix C.8.

Compared with standard AT, our GAIRAT significantly boosts adversarial robustness with little degradation of accuracy, which challenges the inherent trade-off. Besides, FAT also challenges the inherent trade-off instead by improving accuracy with little degradation of robustness. Combining two directions, i.e., GAIR-FAT, we can improve both robustness and accuracy of standard AT. Therefore, Table 1 affirmatively confirms the efficacy of our geometry-aware instance-reweighted methods in significantly improving adversarial training.

# 5 CONCLUSION

This paper has proposed a novel adversarial training method, i.e., geometry-aware instance-weighted adversarial training (GAIRAT). GAIRAT gives more (less) weights to loss of the adversarial data whose natural counterparts are closer to (farther away from) the decision boundary. Under the limited model capacity and the inherent inequality of the data, GAIRAT sheds new lights on improving the adversarial training.
