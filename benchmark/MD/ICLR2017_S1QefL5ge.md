# ABSTRACT

Sum-product networks have recently emerged as an attractive representation due to their dual view as a special type of deep neural network with clear semantics and a special type of probabilistic graphical model for which inference is always tractable. Those properties follow from some conditions (i.e., completeness and decomposability) that must be respected by the structure of the network. As a result, it is not easy to specify a valid sum-product network by hand and therefore structure learning techniques are typically used in practice. While several offline structure learning techniques exist, this paper describes the first online structure learning technique for continuous SPNs with Gaussian leaves.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Sum-product networks (SPNs) were first introduced by Poon & Domingos (2011) as a new type of deep representation. They distinguish themselves from other types of neural networks by several desirable properties:

1. The quantities computed by each node can be clearly interpreted as (un-normalized) probabilities.  
2. SPNs are equivalent to Bayesian and Markov networks (Zhao et al., 2015) while ensuring that exact inference has linear complexity with respect to the size of the network.  
3. They represent generative models that naturally handle arbitrary queries with missing data while changing which variables are treated as inputs and outputs.

There is a catch: these nice properties arise only when the structure of the network satisfies certain conditions (i.e., decomposability and completeness) (Poon & Domingos, 2011). Hence, it is not easy to specify sum-product networks by hand. In particular, fully connected networks typically violate those conditions. Similarly, most sparse structures that are handcrafted by practitioners to compute specific types of features or embeddings also violate those conditions. While this may seem like a major drawback, the benefit is that researchers have been forced to develop structure learning techniques to obtain valid SPNs that satisfy those conditions (Dennis & Ventura, 2012; Gens & Domingos, 2013; Peharz et al., 2013; Rooshenas & Lowd, 2014; Adel et al., 2015; Vergari et al., 2015). At the moment, the search for good network structures in other types of neural networks is typically done by hand based on intuitions as well as trial and error. However the expectation is that automated structure learning techniques will eventually dominate. For this to happen, we need structure learning techniques that can scale easily to large amounts of data.

To that effect, we propose the first online structure learning technique for SPNs with Gaussian leaves. The approach starts with a network structure that assumes that all variables are independent. This network structure is then updated as a stream of data points is processed. Whenever a statistically significant correlation is detected between some variables, a correlation is introduced in the network in the form of a multivariate Gaussian or a mixture distribution. This is done while ensuring that the resulting network structure is necessarily valid. The approach is evaluated on several benchmark problems and a larger audio dataset.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides some background about sum-product networks and existing offline structure learning techniques. Section 3 describes our online structure learning technique for Gaussian SPNs. Section 4 evaluates the performance of our structure learning technique on some benchmark problems and a larger speech dataset. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses possible directions for future work.

# 2 BACKGROUND

Sum-product networks (SPNs) were first proposed by Poon & Domingos (2011) as a new type of deep architecture consisting of a rooted acyclic directed graph with interior nodes that are sums and products while the leaves are tractable distributions, including Bernoulli distributions for discrete SPNs and Gaussian distributions for continuous SPNs. The edges emanating from sum nodes are labeled with non-negative weights  $w$ . An SPN encodes a function  $f(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x})$  that takes as input a variable assignment  $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}$  and produces an output at its root. This function is defined recursively at each node  $n$  as follows:

$$
f _ {n} (\mathbf {X} = \mathbf {x}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \Pr (\mathbf {X} _ {\mathbf {n}} = \mathbf {x} _ {\mathbf {n}}) & \text {i f i s L e a f} (n) \\ \sum_ {i} w _ {i} f _ {\text {c h i l d} _ {i} (n)} (\mathbf {x}) & \text {i f i s S u m} (n) \\ \prod_ {i} f _ {\text {c h i l d} _ {i} (n)} (\mathbf {x}) & \text {i f i s P r o d u c t} (n) \end{array} \right. \tag {1}
$$

Here,  $\mathbf{X}_{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{n}}$  denotes the variable assignment restricted to the variables contained in the leaf  $n$ . If none of the variables in leaf  $n$  are instantiated by  $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}$  then  $\operatorname*{Pr}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{n}}) = \operatorname*{Pr}(\emptyset) = \mathbf{1}$ . Note also that if leaf  $n$  contains continuous variables, then  $\operatorname*{Pr}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{n}})$  should be interpreted as  $\text{pdf}(X_n = x_n)$ .

An SPN is a neural network in the sense that each interior node can be interpreted as computing a linear combination of its children followed by a potentially non-linear activation function. Without loss of generality, assume that the SPN is organized in alternating layers of sums and product nodes. It is easy to see that sum-nodes compute a linear combination of their children. Product nodes can be interpreted as the sum of its children in the log domain. Hence sum-product networks can be viewed as neural networks with logarithmic and exponential activation functions.

An SPN can also be viewed as encoding a joint distribution over the random variables in its leaves when the network structure satisfies certain conditions. These conditions are often defined in terms of the notion of scope.

Definition 1 (Scope) The scope  $(n)$  of a node  $n$  is the set of variables that are descendants of  $n$ .

A sufficient set of conditions includes:

Definition 2 (Completeness (Poon & Domingos, 2011)) An SPN is complete if all children of the same sum node have the same scope.

Definition 3 (Decomposability (Poon & Domingos, 2011)) An SPN is decomposable if all children of the same product node have disjoint scopes.

Here decomposability allows us to interpret product nodes as computing factored distributions with respect to disjoint sets of variables, which ensures that the product is a valid distribution over the union of the scopes of the children. Similarly, completeness allows us to interpret sum nodes as computing a mixture of the distributions encoded by the children since they all have the same scope. Each child is a mixture component with mixture probability proportional to its weight. Hence, in complete and decomposable SPNs, the sub-SPN rooted at each node can be interpreted as encoding an (un-normalized) joint distribution over its scope. We can use the function  $f$  to answer inference queries with respect to the joint distribution encoded by the entire SPN as follows:

- Marginal queries:  $\operatorname{Pr}(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}) = \frac{\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{root}}(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x})}{\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{root}}(\emptyset)}$  
- Conditional queries:  $\operatorname{Pr}(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}|\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{y}) = \frac{\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{root}}(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x},\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{y})}{\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{root}}(\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{y})}$

Unlike most neural networks that can answer only queries with fixed inputs and outputs, SPNs can answer conditional inference queries with varying inputs and outputs simply by changing the set of variables that are queried (outputs) and conditioned on (inputs). Furthermore, SPNs can be used to generate data by sampling from the joint distributions they encode. This is achieved by a top-down pass through the network. Starting at the root, each child of a product node is followed, a single child of a sum node is sampled according to the unnormalized distribution encoded by the weights of the sum node and a variable assignment is sampled in each leaf that is reached. This is particularly useful in natural language generation tasks and image completion tasks (Poon & Domingos, 2011).

Note also that inference queries can be answered exactly in linear time with respect to the size of the network since each query requires two evaluations of the network function  $f$  and each evaluation is performed in a bottom-up pass through the network. This means that SPNs can also be viewed as a special type of tractable probabilistic graphical model, in contrast to Bayesian and Markov networks for which inference is #P-hard (Roth, 1996). Any SPN can be converted into an equivalent bipartite Bayesian network without any exponential blow up, while Bayesian and Markov networks can be converted into equivalent SPNs at the risk of an exponential blow up (Zhao et al., 2015).

Since it is difficult to specify network structures for SPNs that satisfy the decomposability and completeness properties, several automated structure learning techniques have been proposed (Dennis & Ventura, 2012; Gens & Domingos, 2013; Peharz et al., 2013; Rooshenas & Lowd, 2014; Adel et al., 2015; Vergari et al., 2015). While several online learning techniques have been designed to estimate the parameters (i.e., weights) of SPNs (Rashwan et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016; Jaini et al., 2016), existing structure learning techniques are all offline since they require multiple passes over the data. Furthermore, existing structure learning techniques have all been designed for discrete SPNs and have yet to be extended to continuous SPNs such as Gaussian SPNs. Hence, the state of the art for continuous (and large scale) datasets is to generate a random network structure that satisfies decomposability and completeness after which the weights are learned by a scalable online learning technique (Jaini et al., 2016). We advance the state of the art by proposing a first online structure learning technique for Gaussian SPNs.

# 3 PROPOSED ALGORITHM

In this work, we assume that the leaf nodes all have Gaussian distributions. A leaf node may have more than one variable in the scope, in which case it follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

Suppose we want to model a probability distribution over a  $d$ -dimensional space. The algorithm starts with a fully factorized joint probability distribution over all variables,  $p(x) = p(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d) = p_1(x_1)p_2(x_2)\dots p_d(x_d)$ . This distribution is represented by a product node with  $d$  children, the  $i$ th of which is a univariate distribution over the variable  $x_i$ . Therefore, initially we assume that the variables are independent, and the algorithm will update this probability distribution as new data points are processed.

Given a mini-batch of data points, the algorithm passes the points through the network from the root to the leaf nodes and updates each node along the way. This update includes two parts:

- updating the parameters of the SPN, and  
- updating the structure of the network.

# 3.1 PARAMETER UPDATE

The parameters are updated by keeping track of running sufficient statistics. There are two types of parameters in the model: weights on the branches under a sum node, and parameters for the Gaussian distribution in a leaf node.

To estimate the weights under a sum node, each node in the network keeps a count of the data points that have passed through the node during training.

When a sum node receives a set of training points, it distributes them to its children according to their likelihoods. Each data point is passed to the child node that has the highest likelihood at the given point, and the weight  $w_{s,c}$  of a branch between a sum node  $s$  and one of its children  $c$  can then

be estimated as

$$
w _ {s, c} = \frac {n _ {c}}{n _ {s}} \tag {2}
$$

where  $n_s$  is the count of the sum node and  $n_c$  is the count of the child node.

When new data points arrive at a product node, the node updates its count and passes the data points through to each child. There are no parameters associated with a product node; however, it keeps additional statistics that are used for structure update, as discussed in Section 3.2.

Since each leaf node represents a Gaussian distribution, it keeps track of the empirical mean vector  $\mu$  and empirical covariance matrix  $\Sigma$  for the variables in its scope. When a leaf node with a current count of  $n$  receives a batch of  $m$  data points  $x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, \ldots, x^{(m)}$ , the empirical mean and empirical covariance are updated according to the equations:

$$
\mu_ {i} ^ {\prime} = \frac {1}{n + m} \left(n \mu_ {i} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {m} x _ {i} ^ {(k)}\right) \tag {3}
$$

and

$$
\Sigma_ {i, j} ^ {\prime} = \frac {1}{n + m} \left[ n \Sigma_ {i, j} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {m} \left(x _ {i} ^ {(k)} - \mu_ {i}\right) \left(x _ {j} ^ {(k)} - \mu_ {j}\right) \right] - (\mu_ {i} ^ {\prime} - \mu_ {i}) (\mu_ {j} ^ {\prime} - \mu_ {j}) \tag {4}
$$

where  $i$  and  $j$  index the variables in the leaf node's scope, and  $\mu'$  and  $\Sigma'$  are the new mean and covariance after the update.

This simple approach does a single pass through the data and the update of the parameters based on the running sufficient statistics can be seen as locally maximizing the likelihood of the data. The empirical mean and covariance of the Gaussian leaves locally maximize the likelihood of the data that reach that leaf. Similarly, the count ratios used to set the weights under a sum node locally maximize the likelihood of the data that reach each child.

# 3.2 STRUCTURE UPDATE

Just like a leaf node, a product node also keeps track of the empirical mean vector and empirical covariance matrix of the variables in its scope. These are updated in the same way as in the leaf node.

Initially, when a product node is created, all variables in the scope are assumed independent. As new data points arrive at the product node, the covariance matrix is updated, and if the absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables are above a certain threshold, the algorithm updates the structure so that the two variables become correlated in the model.

We correlate two variables in the model by combining the child nodes whose scopes contain the two variables, and the algorithm employs two ways to combine the two child nodes:

- create a multivariate leaf node, or  
- create a mixture of two components over the variables.

These two processes are depicted in Figure 1. On the left, a product node with scope  $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{5}$  originally has three children. The product node keeps track of the empirical mean and empirical covariance for these five variables. Suppose it receives a mini-batch of data and updates the statistics. As a result of this update,  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{3}$  now have a correlation above the threshold. The algorithm can use two approaches to model this correlation.

In the middle of Figure 1, the algorithm combines the two child nodes that have  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{3}$  in scope, and turn them into a multivariate leaf node. Since the product node already keeps track of the mean and covariance of these variables, we can simply use those statistics as the parameters for the new leaf node.

Another way to make  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{3}$  correlated is to create a mixture, as shown in the right part of Figure 1. The mixture has two components. The first component contains the original children of the product node. The second component is a new product node, which is again initialized to have a

![](images/aa3c05f903ce319dc247a8289c4e236f42620a5284ca54213a850e3ce83a4508.jpg)

fully factorized distribution over its scope. The mini-batch of data points are then passed down the new mixture to update its parameters.

Note that although the children are drawn like leaf nodes in the diagrams, they can in fact be entire subtrees. Since the process does not involve the parameters in a child, it works the same way if some of the children are trees instead of single nodes.

The technique chosen to induce a correlation depends on the number of variables in the scope. The algorithm creates a multivariate leaf node when the combined scope of the two child nodes has a number of variables that does not exceed some threshold (4 in the experiments) and if the total number of variables in the problem is greater than this threshold, otherwise it creates a mixture. Since the number of parameters in multivariate Gaussian leaves grows at a quadratic rate with respect to the number of variables, it is not advised to consider multivariate leaves with too many variables. In contrast, the mixture construction increases the number of parameters at a linear rate, which is less prone to overfitting when many variables are correlated.

To simplify the structure, if the product node ends up with only one child, it is removed from the network, and its only child is joined with its parent. Similarly, if a sum node ends up being a child of another sum node, then the child sum node can be removed, and all its children are promoted one layer up.

Note that the this structure learning technique does a single pass through the data and therefore is entirely online. It also ensures that the decomposability and completeness properties are preserved after each update.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

# 4.1 TOY DATASET

As a proof of concept, we first test the algorithm on a toy synthetic dataset. We generate data from the 3-dimensional distribution

$$
\begin{array}{l} p (x _ {1}, x _ {2}, x _ {3}) = [ 0. 2 5 N (x _ {1} | 1, 1) N (x _ {2} | 2, 2) + 0. 2 5 N (x _ {1} | 1 1, 1) N (x _ {2} | 1 2, 2) \\ + 0. 2 5 N (x _ {1} | 2 1, 1) N (x _ {2} | 2 2, 2) + 0. 2 5 N (x _ {1} | 3 1, 1) N (x _ {2} | 3 2, 2) ] N (x _ {3} | 3, 3), \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $N(\cdot |\mu ,\sigma^2)$  is the normal distribution with mean  $\mu$  and variance  $\sigma^2$

Therefore, the first two dimensions  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  are generated from a Gaussian mixture with four components, and  $x_{3}$  is independent from the other two variables.

Starting from a fully factorized distribution, we would expect  $x_{3}$  to remain factorized after learning from data. Furthermore, the algorithm should generate new components along the first two dimensions as more data points are received since  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  are correlated.

This is indeed what happens. Figure 2 shows the structure learned after 200 and 500 data points. The variable  $x_{3}$  remains factorized regardless of the number of data points seen, whereas more components are created for  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  as more data points are processed.

Figure 3 shows the data points along the first two dimensions and the Gaussian components learned. We can see that the algorithm generates new components to try to model the correlation between  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  as it processes more data.

# 4.2 REAL DATASETS

To test our algorithm on real datasets, we run it on the same datasets used by Jaini et al. (2016). We use 0.1 as the correlation threshold in all experiments, and we use mini-batch sizes of 1 for the three datasets with fewest instances (Quake, Banknote, Abalone), 8 for the two slightly larger ones (Kinematics, CA), and 256 for the two datasets with most instances (Flow Size, Sensorless).

The experimental results for our algorithm called online structure learning with running average update (oSLRAU) are listed in Table 1 along with results reproduced from Jaini et al. (2016). The table reports the average test log likelihoods plus/minus one standard deviation on 10-fold cross validation. oSLRAU achieved better likelihoods than online Bayesian moment matching (oBMM) (Jaini et al., 2016) and online expectation maximization (oEM) (Cappé & Moulines, 2009) with network structures generated at random or corresponding to Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). This highlights the main advantage of oSLRAU: learning a structure that models the data. (SRBMs) (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009) and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GenMMNs) (Li et al., 2015), which are other types of deep generative models. Their network structures are fully connected while ensuring that the number of parameters is comparable to those of the SPNs. oSLRAU outperform these models on 5 datasets while SRBMs and GenMMNs each outperform oSLRAU on one dataset.

We also tested the algorithm on a larger dataset to get an idea of its running time. We downloaded roughly 11.5 hours of audio from the VoxForge repository  $^{2}$ , of which 10 hours are used for training and 1.5 hours for testing. The audio files are processed at 100 frames per second, and 39 features based on mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are extracted from each frame. This gives us 3,603,643 data points in the training set and 537,597 points in the test set, with each point having 39 dimensions. VoxForge is an online audio repository, which lets users record themselves by reading a set of prompts and submitting the audio files to the server. We trained the model using each submission as one batch. Running the algorithm on the training data took 1.7 hours and resulted in a test log likelihood of -29.60 per data point.

To see the effectiveness of the structure learning algorithm, we also compared the test log likelihood with what the result would be using a fixed structure with the same running average update for parameter learning. We randomly generated 10 networks, and during training, we only updated the parameters without changing the structure. On these 10 runs we obtained an average test log likelihood of -33.88 with a standard deviation of 1.05, showing that the structure learned is effective.

# 5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

This paper describes a first online structure learning technique for Gaussian SPNs that does a single pass through the data. This allowed us to learn the structure of Gaussian SPNs in domains for which the state of the art was previously to generate a random network structure.

In the future, this work could be extended in several directions. Since nodes on different branches are independent of each other, we could speed up the update process by running the update on different branches in parallel. This will allow us to run experiments on much larger datasets.

We are also investigating the combination of our structure learning technique with other parameter learning methods. Currently, we are simply learning the parameters by keeping running statistics for the weights, mean vectors, and covariance matrices. It might be possible to improve the performance by using more sophisticated parameter learning algorithms.

Finally, we would like to look into ways to automatically control the complexity of the networks. For example, it would be useful to add a regularization mechanism to avoid possible overfitting.

We are also building an open source GPU optimized library for SPNs, and the source code should be out by December 2016.
