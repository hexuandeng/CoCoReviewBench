# ABSTRACT

Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over  $90\%$ , decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance.

We find that a standard technique for pruning weights naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the lottery ticket hypothesis: unpruned, randomly-initialized feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (winning tickets) that—when trained in isolation—converge in a comparable number of iterations to comparable generalization accuracy. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective.

We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than  $10\%$  of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Furthermore, the winning tickets we find above that size converge faster than the original network and exhibit higher test accuracy.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Techniques for eliminating unnecessary weights from neural networks (pruning) (LeCun et al., 1990; Hassibi & Stork, 1993; Han et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016) can reduce parameter-counts by more than  $90\%$  while maintaining accuracy. Doing so diminishes the size (Han et al., 2015; Hinton et al., 2015) or energy consumption (Yang et al., 2017; Molchanov et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2017) of trained networks, making inference more efficient. If the unpruned networks have such excess capacity, why do we not train the smaller, pruned architectures instead in the interest of more efficient training? Contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures uncovered by pruning are harder to optimize, reaching lower generalization accuracy than the original networks when trained from the start. $^{1}$

Consider an example. In Figure 1, we randomly sample and train sparse subnetworks of decreasing size from a fully-connected network for MNIST and convolutional networks for CIFAR10. Dashed lines trace the average (ten trials) convergence times and test accuracy at convergence of networks trained at various sizes. The sparser the network, the worse the convergence times and test accuracy.

In this paper, we show that there consistently exist sparse subnetworks that train from the start and at least match the test accuracy and convergence times of the original network. The solid lines in Figure 1 show some of these networks. Based on these results, we articulate the lottery ticket hypothesis.

The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. Any randomly-initialized feed-forward neural network that trains to convergence and reaches a particular generalization accuracy contains a subnetwork that is

The dashed lines are randomly sampled sparse networks (averaged across ten trials). The solid lines are winning tickets (averaged across five trials).

initialized such that—when trained in isolation—it can learn to match the generalization accuracy of the original network in at most the same number of training iterations.

We find that a standard pruning technique automatically uncovers such subnetworks from fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward networks. We designate these subnetworks winning tickets, since those that we find have won the initialization lottery with a combination of weights and connections capable of training. When randomly reinitialized, our winning tickets no longer match the performance of the original network, explaining the difficulty of training pruned networks from scratch and the importance of the original initialization.

Finding winning tickets. We identify winning tickets by training networks and subsequently pruning their smallest-magnitude weights. The set of connections that survives this process is the architecture of a winning ticket. Unique to our work, the winning ticket's weights are the values to which these connections were initialized before training. This forms our central experiment:

1. Randomly initialize a neural network.  
2. Train the network until it converges.  
3. Prune a fraction of the network.  
4. To extract the winning ticket, reset the weights of the remaining portion of the network to their values from (1)—the initializations they received before training began.

If large networks contain winning tickets and pruning reveals them, then the pruned network—when reset to the original initializations and trained to convergence—will maintain competitive accuracy and convergence times at sizes too small for a randomly-initialized network to do the same.

Research questions and results. In this paper, we investigate the following questions:

How does the lottery ticket hypothesis manifest for different networks? We identify winning tickets in a fully-connected architecture for MNIST and convolutional architectures for CIFAR10 across several optimization strategies (SGD, momentum, and Adam) and dropout.

How large are winning tickets? The winning tickets we find are  $10\%$  (or less) of the size of the "original network and match its convergence times and accuracy.

How important are the structure and initialization of a winning ticket? When randomly reinitialized, winning tickets perform far worse than the original network, meaning structure alone cannot explain a winning ticket's success.

The Lottery Ticket Conjecture. Returning to our motivating question, we extend our hypothesis into an untested conjecture that gradient descent seeks out and trains a subset of well-initialized weights: Randomly-initialized, unpruned networks are easier to train because they have more possible subnetworks from which training can recover a winning ticket.

- We demonstrate that pruning uncovers sparse, trainable networks that generalize as well as the original, feed-forward networks from which they derived.  
- We show that winning tickets at moderate levels of pruning converge in fewer iterations and reach higher accuracy than the original network.  
- We propose the lottery ticket hypothesis as a new perspective on the composition of neural networks to explain these findings.

Implications. In this paper, we empirically study the lottery ticket hypothesis. Now that we have demonstrated the existence of winning tickets, we hope to exploit this knowledge to:

Improve the performance of training. Since winning tickets can be trained from the start in isolation, we can design training schemes that search for winning tickets and prune as early as possible.

Design better networks. Winning tickets reveal combinations of sparse architectures and initializations that are particularly adept at learning. We can find, study, and take inspiration from winning tickets to design new architectures with the same inductive biases conducive to learning.

Improve our theoretical understanding of neural networks. We can study why feed-forward networks trained with gradient descent seem to consistently contain winning tickets and improve our understanding of the way neural networks learn.

# 2 WINNING TICKETS IN FULLY-CONNECTED NETWORKS

In this Section, we assess the lottery ticket hypothesis as applied to fully-connected networks trained on MNIST. We use the lenet-300-100 architecture (LeCun et al., 1998) as described in Figure 2. We follow the outline from Section 1: after randomly initializing and training a network, we prune the network and reset the remaining connections to their original initializations. We use a simple pruning heuristic: remove a percentage of the weights with the lowest magnitudes within each layer (as in Han et al. (2015)). Connections to outputs are pruned at half of the rate of the rest of the network. We present the results of an exploration of the hyperparameters in Appendix B, including other learning rates, optimization strategies (SGD, momentum), initialization strategies, and network sizes.

We test two pruning strategies: one-shot pruning and iterative pruning. One-shot pruning prunes all at once in a single step after training. Iterative pruning repeatedly trains, prunes, and resets the weights, removing more of the network on each iteration of the process.

Overview of results. Winning tickets found via pruning converge faster than the original network. Figure 3 plots the test set accuracy and convergence behavior during training of winning tickets iteratively pruned to different levels. We define convergence as the iteration of minimal test loss. Each curve is the average of five runs; error bars are the minimum and maximum of any run. For the first few pruning steps, convergence times decrease and test accuracy increases (left graph in Figure 3). A winning ticket comprising  $51.3\%$  of the weights from the original network converges faster

than the original network but slower than when pruned to  $21.1\%$ . After  $21.1\%$ , convergence times increase (middle graph). When pruned to about  $7\%$ , a winning ticket regresses to the performance of the original network. A similar pattern repeats throughout this paper.

Oneshot pruning. The top of Figure 4 summarizes this behavior for all pruning levels under oneshot pruning. On the left are convergence times in relation to the percent of weights remaining after pruning; on the right is accuracy at convergence. When pruned to  $22\%$  of the original network size, the average winning tickets continue to converge as fast as the original network; when pruned to between  $52\%$  and  $10\%$ , test accuracy is higher than the original network. Further pruning beyond these thresholds causes convergence times and accuracy to degrade.

Iterative pruning. Figure 4 (bottom) shows the results of iteratively pruning by  $20\%$  per iteration (blue). One-shot data from Figure 4 (top) is reproduced in green. (The x-axis is now logarithmic.) Iteratively-pruned winning tickets converge faster and reach higher test accuracy at smaller network sizes. Average convergence times decrease until  $21\%$  of the network remains, at which point the winning ticket converges on average  $27\%$  faster than the original network. After this point, further pruning causes convergence times to increase, reaching the convergence time of the original network when  $7\%$  of the network remains. Test accuracy increases with pruning, improving by more than 0.4 percentage points when the network is pruned to  $17\%$  of its original size; after this point, accuracy decreases, returning to the level of the original network when  $3.5\%$  of weights remain. Although iterative pruning extracts smaller winning tickets, repeated training means they are costlier to find. However, we aim to analyze the behavior of winning tickets rather than to find them efficiently. Iterative pruning's advantage is that it puts a tighter upper-bound on the size of a winning ticket.

Random reinitialization. To measure the importance of a winning ticket's initialization, we retain the structure of a winning ticket but randomly sample new initializations from the original distribution. We randomly reinitialize each winning ticket three times, making 15 total per point in Figure 4. We find that initialization is crucial for the efficacy of a winning ticket.

The right graph in Figure 3 shows this experiment for iterative pruning. In addition to the original network and winning tickets at  $51\%$  and  $21\%$ , it has two curves for the random reinitialization experiments. Where convergence times improve for the winning tickets, they progressively worsen when randomly reinitialized. The broader results of this experiment are the red line and orange line (random reinitialization of one-shot and iterative winning tickets, respectively) in Figure 4. Unlike winning tickets, the reinitialized networks converge increasingly slower than the original network and lose test accuracy after little pruning. The average reinitialized iterative winning ticket's test accuracy drops off from the original accuracy when the network is pruned to about  $26.3\%$ , compared to  $2.9\%$  for the winning ticket. When pruned to  $21\%$ , the winning ticket converges  $2.44\mathrm{x}$  faster than when reinitialized and is half a percentage point more accurate. This experiment supports the lottery ticket hypothesis' emphasis on initialization: the original initialization withstands and benefits from pruning, while the random reinitialization's performance immediately suffers and diminishes steadily.

# 3 WINNING TICKETS IN CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS

Here, we apply the lottery ticket hypothesis to convolutional networks on CIFAR10. We consider the conv2, conv4, and conv6 architectures in Figure 2, which are scaled-down variants of the VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) family. The networks have two, four, and six convolutional layers, respectively, followed by two fully-connected layers. The networks cover the range from fully-connected to convolutional networks, with less than  $1\%$  of parameters in convolutional layers in conv2 to nearly two thirds in conv6. We present the results of an exploration of the hyperparameters in Appendix C, including other learning rates and optimization strategies (SGD, momentum). We investigate three questions:

Question 1: How does the lottery ticket hypothesis manifest for convolutional networks?

Question 2: What is the effect of randomly reinitializing winning tickets?

Question 3: What is the effect of pruning convolutions and fully-connected layers alone and together?

Question 1. The solid lines in Figure 5 show the iterative lottery ticket experiment on conv2 (blue), conv4 (orange), and conv6 (green) at the pruning rates from Figure 2. The pattern from Section 2 repeats: as the network is pruned, convergence times drop and test accuracy rises as compared to the original network. In this case, the results are more pronounced. Winning tickets converge at best  $3.91\mathrm{x}$  faster for conv2 ( $5.7\%$  of weights remaining),  $4.17\mathrm{x}$  for conv4 ( $9.2\%$  remaining), and  $2.41\mathrm{x}$  for conv6 ( $12.6\%$  remaining). Test accuracy improves at best 3.5 percentage points for conv2

![](images/5ccd9cfce5d6ae26dbf5c43e9b3ff7c99928c6827378d393c538dc2f36073f70.jpg)  
Figure 6: Convergence times and accuracy of the conv2 (left), conv4 (middle), and conv6 (right) networks when only convolutions are pruned, only fully-connected layers are pruned, and both are pruned. The x-axis measures the number of pruning iterations, making it possible to see the relative contributions to the overall network made by pruning FC layers and convolutions individually.

(11.0% remaining), 2.6 for conv4 (7.7% remaining), and 3.5 for conv6 (15.1% remaining). All three networks remain above their original average test accuracy until 2% or less of weights remain.

Question 2. We repeat the random reinitialization trial from Section 2, which appears as the dashed lines in Figure 5. These experiments again take increasingly longer to converge upon continued pruning. As in Section 2, test accuracy drops off more quickly for the random reinitialization experiments. However, unlike Section 2, test accuracy at convergence time initially remains steady and even improves for conv2 and conv4, indicating that—at moderate levels of pruning—the structure of the winning tickets alone may lead to better generalization.

Question 3. Figure 6 shows the effect of pruning just convolutions (green), just fully-connected layers (orange) and pruning both (blue). The x-axis measures the number of pruning iterations to emphasize the relative contributions made by pruning convolutions and fully-connected layers to the overall network. In all three cases, pruning convolutions alone leads to improvements in test accuracy and convergence times; pruning fully-connected layers alone generally causes test accuracy to worsen and convergence times to increase. Pruning convolutional layers alone improves the best average test accuracy by 1.3 and 0.8 percentage points for conv4 and conv6, respectively. However, pruning convolutions alone has limited ability to reduce the overall parameter-count of the network, since fully-connected layers comprise  $99\%$ ,  $89\%$ , and  $35\%$  of the parameters in conv2, conv4, and conv6.

# 4 WINNING TICKETS AND DROPOUT

Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2012) improves network accuracy by randomly disabling a fraction of the units (i.e., randomly sampling a subnetwork) on each training iteration. Baldi & Sadowski (2013) characterize dropout as simultaneously training the ensemble of all subnetworks. Since the lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that one of these subnetworks comprises a winning ticket, it is natural to ask whether dropout and our strategy for finding winning tickets interact.

Figure 7 shows the results of training conv2, conv4, and conv6 with a dropout rate of 0.5. Dashed lines are the network performance without dropout (the solid lines in Figure 5). We continue to find winning tickets when training with dropout. Dropout increases initial test accuracy (3.6, 2.7, and 2.0 percentage points on average for conv2, conv4, and conv6, respectively), and iterative pruning increases it further (up to 3.7, 4.8, and 4.9 percentage points, respectively, on average). Convergence times improve with iterative pruning as before, but less dramatically in the case of conv2.

![](images/3053ddcb5c0fbae8b481982e7de890c8d5865311bd985f5c2190d790d955afc4.jpg)  
Figure 7: Convergence behavior and test accuracy of conv2, conv4, and conv6 when iteratively pruned and trained with dropout. The dashed lines are the same networks trained without dropout (the solid lines in Figure 5. Learning rates are 0.0003 for conv2 and 0.0002 for conv4 and conv6.

These improvements suggest that our iterative pruning strategy interacts with dropout in a complementary way. Srivastava et al. (2014) observe that dropout induces sparse activations in the final network; it is possible that dropout-induced sparsity primes a network to be pruned. If so, dropout techniques that target weights (Wan et al., 2013) or learn per-weight dropout probabilities (Molchanov et al., 2017; Louizos et al., 2018) could make winning tickets even easier to find.

# 5 DISCUSSION

Neural network pruning (e.g., Han et al. (2015)) asks whether the function learned by the original, unpruned network can be represented by a smaller network. It answers this question affirmatively, constructing such a network by training the original network, pruning connections, and further training the already-trained weights. In effect, the initial stage of training the unpruned network serves to warm up the weights of the pruned network so that it can be optimized. Whether such a smaller representation can be trained from the start has remained an open question; we answer that question affirmatively for the feed-forward architectures evaluated in this paper, and the lottery ticket hypothesis contends that this property applies to feed-forward networks more generally.

We extend the lottery ticket hypothesis into a conjecture that winning tickets are not just an artifact that we uncover but a central element of the neural network optimization process. Namely, gradient descent seeks out and trains fortuitously-initialized subcomponents of unpruned networks; by this logic, unpruned networks are easier to optimize than pruned networks because they have more combinations of subcomponents (that is, more "lottery tickets") that have the potential to become winning tickets through lucky initialization. From this point of view, training could be seen as a process of both subnetwork search and optimization. This remains a conjecture, and we have not justified it with experimental evidence: although we show that many networks contain winning tickets, we do not show that containing a winning ticket is necessary or sufficient for a network to learn successfully. We leave consideration of this question to future work.

# 6 LIMITATIONS

We show that iterative pruning recovers winning tickets from fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward networks trained on MNIST and CIFAR10. We acknowledge several limitations of our experiments. We only consider vision-centric datasets and networks, and our experiments use smaller datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10) and networks. We do not investigate larger networks for larger datasets (namely Imagenet (Russakovsky et al., 2015)) because iterative pruning is exceedingly computationally expensive, requiring training a network 15 or more times consecutively for multiple trials; hyperparameter search multiplicatively increases this cost.

We only consider fully-connected and convolutional architectures. We do not consider RNNs, GNNs, etc. In Appendix D, we apply this technique to resnet18; iterative pruning does not find winning tickets at the learning rate in He et al. (2016) but finds winning tickets of commensurate accuracy at lower learning rates.

The winning tickets we find have initializations that allow them to match the performance of the unpruned networks at sizes far smaller than randomly-initialized networks can do the same. We do not explore the properties of these initializations that, in concert with the inductive biases of the pruned network architectures, makes these networks particularly adept at learning.

# 7 RELATED WORK

In practice, neural networks tend to be dramatically overparameterized. Distillation (Ba & Caruana, 2014; Hinton et al., 2015) and pruning (LeCun et al., 1990; Han et al., 2015) rely on the fact that parameters can be reduced while preserving accuracy. Even with sufficient capacity to memorize training data, networks naturally learn simpler functions (Zhang et al., 2016; Neyshabur et al., 2014; Arpit et al., 2017). Contemporary experience (Bengio et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016) and Figure 1 suggest that overparameterized networks are easier to train. We show that dense networks contain sparse subnetworks capable of learning on their own starting from their original initializations. Several other research directions aim to train small or sparse networks.

Prior to training. Squeezenet (Iandola et al., 2016) and MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017) are specifically engineered image-recognition networks that are an order of magnitude smaller than standard architectures. Denil et al. (2013) represent weight matrices as products of lower-rank factors. Li et al. (2018) restrict optimization to a small, randomly-sampled subspace of the parameter space (meaning all parameters can still be updated); they successfully train networks under this restriction. We show that one need not even update all parameters to optimize a network, and we find winning tickets though a principled search process involving pruning. Our contribution to this class of approaches is to demonstrate that sparse, trainable networks exist within larger networks.

After training. Distillation (Ba & Caruana, 2014; Hinton et al., 2015) trains small networks to mimic the behavior of large networks; small networks are easier to train in this paradigm. Recent pruning work aims to compress large models into forms that run with limited resources (e.g., on mobile devices). Although pruning is central to our experiments, we aim to gain insight into why training needs the overparameterized networks that make pruning necessary. LeCun et al. (1990) and Hassibi & Stork (1993) first explored pruning based on second derivatives. More recently, Han et al. (2015) showed per-weight magnitude-based pruning substantially reduces the size of image-recognition networks. Han et al. iteratively train to convergence, prune, and continue training. Guo et al. (2016) restore pruned connections as they become relevant again. Han et al. (2017) and Jin et al. (2016) restore pruned connections to increase network capacity after small weights have been pruned and surviving weights fine-tuned. Other proposed pruning heuristics include pruning based on activations (Hu et al., 2016), redundancy (Mariet & Sra, 2016; Srinivas & Babu, 2015a), per-layer second derivatives (Dong et al., 2017), and energy/computation efficiency (Yang et al., 2017) (e.g., pruning convolutional filters (Li et al., 2016; Molchanov et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2017) or channels (He et al., 2017)). Cohen et al. (2016) observe that convolutional filters are sensitive to initialization ("The Filter Lottery"); after training, they randomly reinitialize unimportant filters.

During training, Bellec et al. (2018) train with sparse networks and replace weights that reach zero with new random connections. Srinivas et al. (2017) and Louizos et al. (2018) learn gating variables that minimize the number of nonzero parameters. Narang et al. (2017) integrate magnitude-based pruning into training. Gal & Ghahramani (2016) show that dropout approximates Bayesian inference in Gaussian processes. Bayesian perspectives on dropout learn dropout probabilities during training (Gal et al., 2017; Kingma et al., 2015; Srinivas & Babu, 2016). Techniques that learn perweight, per-unit (Srinivas & Babu, 2016), or structured dropout probabilities naturally (Molchanov et al., 2017; Neklyudov et al., 2017) or explicitly (Louizos et al., 2017; Srinivas & Babu, 2015b) prune and sparsify networks during training as dropout probabilities for some weights reach 1. In contrast, we train networks at least once to find winning tickets. These techniques might also find winning tickets, or, by inducing sparsity, might beneficially interact with our methods.
