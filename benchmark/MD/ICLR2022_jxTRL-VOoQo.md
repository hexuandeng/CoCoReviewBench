# ABSTRACT

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have already been widely applied in various graph mining tasks. However, most GNNs only have shallow architectures, which limits performance improvement. In this paper, we conduct a systematic experimental evaluation on the fundamental limitations of current architecture designs. Based on the experimental results, we answer the following two essential questions: (1) what actually leads to the compromised performance of deep GNNs; (2) how to build deep GNNs. The answers to the above questions provide empirical insights and guidelines for researchers to design deep GNNs. Further, we present Deep Graph Multi-Layer Perceptron (DGMLP), a powerful approach implementing our proposed guidelines. Experimental results demonstrate three advantages of DGMLP: 1) high accuracy – it achieves state-of-the-art node classification performance on various datasets; 2) high flexibility – it can flexibly choose different propagation and transformation depths according to certain graph properties; 3) high scalability and efficiency – it supports fast training on large-scale graphs.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The recent success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Zhang et al., 2020) has boosted researches on knowledge discovery and data mining on graph data. Designed for graph-structured data, GNNs provide a universal way to tackle node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks, including social network analysis (Qiu et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2021), chemistry and biology (Dai et al., 2019; Bradshaw et al., 2019; Do et al., 2019), recommendation (Monti et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2019), natural language processing (Bastings et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2021; Vashishth et al., 2020), and computer vision (Qi et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2019; Sarlin et al., 2020).

The key to the success of most GNNs lies in the graph convolution operation, which propagates neighbor information to the center node in an iterative manner (Wu et al., 2019). The graph convolution operation can be further decomposed into two sequential operations: embedding propagation (EP) and embedding transformation (ET). The EP operation can be viewed as a special form of Laplacian smoothing (NT & Maehara, 2019), which combines the embeddings of a node itself and its one-hop neighbors. The embeddings of nodes within the same connected component would become similar after applying the smoothing operation, which greatly eases the downstream tasks. The ET operation applies neural networks and transforms the node embeddings to target dimensions. Taking the widely-used Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2016) as an example, through stacking  $k$  convolution operations (i.e., layers), each node in GCN can utilize the information from nodes within its  $k$ -hop neighborhood, and thus improve the predictive accuracy by getting more unlabeled nodes involved in the training process.

Despite the remarkable success, simply stacking many graph convolution operations leads to massive performance degradation. As a result, most GNNs today only have shallow architectures (e.g., 2 or 3 layers), which limits their exploitation of deep structural information. Concretely, under the semi-supervised setting where only a few labels are given, shallow GNNs can utilize only a small percentage of nodes during model training, leading to sub-optimal node classification accuracy.

To alleviate the problem that GNNs cannot go deep, many researches have been proposed, and they attribute the performance degradation of deep GNNs to several reasons. Among the suggested reasons, most existing works (Feng et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020a; Zhao & Akoglu, 2020; Godwin et al., 2021; Rong et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2020a; Min et al., 2020; Chamberlain et al., 2021; Chien et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020a; Hou et al., 2019; Beaini et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021; Cai & Wang,

2020) consider the over-smoothing issue as the major cause of performance degradation of deep GNNs. Notice that the EP operation smooths the node embeddings, i.e., making nodes within the same connected component similar. If a GNN is stacked with a large number of graph convolution operations, the output embeddings might be over-smoothed, i.e., nodes within the same connected component become indistinguishable.

Questions Investigated. In this paper, we dive deep into the problem of why most existing GNNs cannot go deep and try to present answers to the following two key questions:

Q1: What actually limits the deep stacking of convolution operations in GNN designs?  
Q2: How can we design deep GNNs with the help of the findings from the experimental analysis and outperform the state-of-the-art GNNs?

Contributions. To answer the above research questions, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation to revise the over-smoothing issue and identify the root cause of performance degradation of most existing GNNs when they go deep. Based on the above analysis, we obtain helpful insights and guidelines to design deep GNNs. Our main contributions are summarized as follows.

C1: We clarify the concept of model depth by separating and considering the two different depths when designing deep GNNs: the propagation depth  $D_{p}$  and the transformation depth  $D_{t}$ . Through experimental evaluations, we find that large  $D_{p}$  leads to the over-smoothing issue whereas large  $D_{t}$  leads to the model degradation issue in the current GNN models. Moreover, we observed that the latter usually happens much earlier than the former as  $D_{p}$  and  $D_{t}$  increase at the same speed. Thus, the model degradation issue introduced by large  $D_{t}$  is the true root cause for the failure of deep GNNs.  
C2: To design models that support large  $D_{p}$ , we propose a node-adaptive combination mechanism for combining propagated features under EP operations of different steps. To support large  $D_{t}$ , we add residual connections between ET operations to alleviate the model degradation issue. Further, we present Deep Graph Multi-Layer Perceptron (DGMLP), a novel approach that adopts the composition of the above mentioned two mechanisms to successfully support both large  $D_{p}$  and large  $D_{t}$  based on our findings from the experimental analysis. We validate the effectiveness of DGMLP on six public datasets and the Industry dataset from the real industrial environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DGMLP outperforms the SOTA GNNs while maintaining high scalability and efficiency.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to conduct an experimental evaluation that identifies the major reason why most existing GNNs cannot go deep. Our findings and the derived guidelines open up a new perspective on designing deep GNNs for graph-structured data.

# 2 PRELIMINARY

In this section, we first explain the problem formulation. Then we introduce Embedding Propagation (EP) and Embedding Transformation (ET) in the graph convolution operation in detail.

# 2.1 PROBLEM FORMALIZATION

In this paper, we consider an undirected graph  $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$  with  $|\mathcal{V}| = N$  nodes and  $|\mathcal{E}| = M$  edges.  $\mathbf{A}$  is the adjacency matrix of  $\mathcal{G}$ , weighted or not. Each node possibly has a feature vector of size  $d$ , stacked up to an  $N\times d$  matrix  $\mathbf{X}$ .  $\mathbf{D} = \mathrm{diag}(d_1,d_2,\dots ,d_n)\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$  denotes the degree matrix of  $\mathbf{A}$ , where  $d_{i} = \sum_{j\in \mathcal{V}}\mathbf{A}_{ij}$  is the degree of node  $i$ . In this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised node classification task. Suppose  $\mathcal{V}_l$  is the labeled node set, the goal is to predict the labels for nodes in the unlabeled set  $\mathcal{V}_u$  under the limited supervision of labels for nodes in  $\mathcal{V}_l$ .

# 2.2 CONVOLUTION ON GRAPHS

Graph Convolution. Based on the intuitive assumption that locally connected nodes are likely to have the same label (McPherson et al., 2001), GNN iteratively propagates the information of each

Figure 1: The relationship between GCN and MLP.

node to its adjacent nodes. For example, each graph convolution operation in GCN firstly propagates the node embeddings to their neighborhoods and then transforms their propagated node embeddings:

$$
\mathbf {X} ^ {(k + 1)} = \sigma \left(\hat {\mathbf {A}} \mathbf {X} ^ {(k)} \mathbf {W} ^ {(k)}\right), \quad \hat {\mathbf {A}} = \tilde {\mathbf {D}} ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \tilde {\mathbf {A}} \tilde {\mathbf {D}} ^ {- \frac {1}{2}}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $\mathbf{X}^{(k)}$  and  $\mathbf{X}^{(k + 1)}$  are the node embedding matrices at layer  $k$  and  $k + 1$ , respectively.  $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}} = \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{I}_N$  is the adjacency matrix of the undirected graph  $\mathcal{G}$  with self loops added, where  $\mathbf{I}_N$  is the identity matrix.  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}$  is the normalized adjacency matrix, and  $\widetilde{\mathbf{D}}$  is its corresponding degree matrix.

By setting different  $r$  in  $\hat{\mathbf{A}} = \widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{r-1}\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}\widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{-r}$ , different normalization strategies can be employed, such as the symmetric normalized matrix  $\widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}\widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$  (Kipf & Welling, 2016), the random walk transition probability matrix  $\widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{-1}\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}$  (Xu et al., 2018), and the reverse random walk transition probability matrix  $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}\widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{-1}$  (Zeng et al., 2020b). We adopt  $\hat{\mathbf{A}} = \widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}\widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$  in this work.

EP and ET Operations. Each graph convolution operation in GNNs can be decomposed into two sequential operations: Embedding Propagation (EP) and Embedding Transformation (ET). This decomposition naturally leads to two corresponding GNN depths: propagation depth  $D_{p}$  and transformation depth  $D_{t}$ . Concretely, GNN first executes EP, which generates smoothed features by multiplying the normalized adjacency matrix  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}$  with the node embedding matrix  $\mathbf{X}$ :

$$
\operatorname {E P} (\mathbf {X}) = \hat {\mathbf {A}} \mathbf {X}. \tag {2}
$$

Then, the smoothed features  $\hat{\mathbf{X}} = \mathrm{EP}(\mathbf{X})$  will be transformed with the learnable transformation matrix  $\mathbf{W}$  and the activation function  $\sigma (\cdot)$ :

$$
\operatorname {E T} (\hat {\mathbf {X}}) = \sigma (\hat {\mathbf {X}} \mathbf {W}). \tag {3}
$$

Fig. 1 shows the framework of a two-layer GCN. To note that, GCN will degrade to MLP if  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}$  is the identity matrix, which is equal to removing the EP operation in all GCN layers. More detailed analysis and classification of current GNN approaches can be found in Appendix A.

# 3 SMOOTHNESS MEASUREMENT

In Eq. 2, each time  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}$  multiplies with  $\mathbf{X}$ , information one more hop away can be acquired for each node. Thus, in order to fully leverage high-order neighborhood information, a series of multiplications of  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{X}$ , i.e., the EP operation, have to be carried out, which means stacking multiple GNN layers. However, if we execute  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{X}$  numerous times, the node embeddings within the same connected component would reach a stationary state, leading to indistinguishable node embeddings (i.e., oversmoothing issue). Concretely, when adopting  $\hat{\mathbf{A}} = \widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{r - 1}\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}\widetilde{\mathbf{D}}^{-r}$ ,  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}^{\infty}$  follows

$$
\hat {\mathbf {A}} _ {i, j} ^ {\infty} = \frac {\left(d _ {i} + 1\right) ^ {r} \left(d _ {j} + 1\right) ^ {1 - r}}{2 m + n}, \tag {4}
$$

which shows that after infinite times of multiplication, the influence from node  $i$  to  $j$  is only determined by the degrees of them. Under this scenario, the neighborhood information is fully corrupted, resulting in catastrophic node classification accuracy.

As the over-smoothing issue is only introduced by the EP operation rather than the ET operation, here we introduce a new metric, "Node Smoothness Level (NSL)", to evaluate the smoothness of a node after  $k$  steps of EP operation. Suppose  $\mathbf{X}^{(0)} = \mathbf{X}$  is the original node feature matrix, and  $\mathbf{X}^{(k)} = \hat{\mathbf{A}}^k\mathbf{X}^{(0)}$  is the smoothed features after  $k$  times of EP operation.

Definition 3.1 (Node Smoothing Level). The Node Smoothing Level  $NSL_{v}(k)$  parameterized by node  $v$  and the EP steps,  $k$ , is defined as:

$$
\alpha = \operatorname {S i m} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {v} ^ {k}, \mathbf {x} _ {v} ^ {0}\right), \quad \beta = \operatorname {S i m} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {v} ^ {k}, \mathbf {x} _ {v} ^ {\infty}\right), \quad N S L _ {v} (k) = \alpha * (1 - \beta), \tag {5}
$$

where  $\mathbf{x}_v^k$  is the smoothed feature of node  $v$  after  $k$  steps of EP operation,  $\mathbf{x}_v^0$  represents node  $v$ 's original feature, and  $\mathbf{x}_v^\infty$  represents node  $v$ 's feature at stationary state. Sim( $\cdot$ ) is a similarity function, being the cosine similarity in the following discussion.

Further, the "Graph Smoothing Level" (GSL) parameterized by the EP steps,  $k$ , is defined as:

$$
G S L (k) = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {v \in \mathcal {V}} N S L _ {v} (k). \tag {6}
$$

Smaller  $GSL(k)$  means that  $\mathbf{X}^{(k)}$  is more likely to forget the original node feature information  $\mathbf{X}^{(0)}$  after  $k$  steps of EP operation and has a higher risk of the over-smoothing issue.

# 4 MISCONCEPTIONS AND THE TRUE ROOT CAUSE

Most previous works (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) claim that the over-smoothing issue is main cause for the failure of deep GNNs. There have been lines of works that aim at designing deep GNNs. For example, DropEdge (Rong et al., 2019) randomly removes edges during training, and Grand (Feng et al., 2020) randomly drops raw features of nodes before propagation. Despite their ability to go deeper while maintaining or even getting better predictive accuracy, the explanations for their effectiveness are misleading in some instances. The experimental analysis about misconceptions other than the over-smoothing issue can be found in Appendix C.

# 4.1 IS OVER-SMOOTHING REALLY THE ROOT CAUSE?

Enlarging  $D_{p}$  in Vanilla GCN. To investigate the relations between smoothness and node classification accuracy, we increase the number of graph convolutional layers in vanilla GCN  $(D_{p} = D_{t})$  and a modified GCN with  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}^2$  being the normalized adjacency matrix  $(D_{p} = 2D_{t})$  on the PubMed dataset (Sen et al., 2008). Supposing that the over-smoothing issue is the main cause for the failure of deep GNNs, the predictive accuracy of the GCN with  $D_{p} = 2D_{t}$  should be way lower than the one of vanilla GCN. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 2(a).

From Fig. 2(a), we can see that even with a higher level of smoothness, GCN with  $D_{p} = 2D_{t}$  always has similar predictive accuracy with vanilla GCN ( $D_{p} = D_{t}$ ) when  $D_{t}$  ranges from 1 to 8, and the over-smoothing issue seems to begin dominating the performance decline only when  $D_{p}$  exceeds 16 ( $2 \times 8$ ). The performance of vanilla GCN does decrease sharply when  $D_{p}$  exceeds 2, which is precisely the situation the over-smoothing issue suggests. However, even with relatively large  $D_{p}$  (e.g., 12), the predictive accuracy of the model with larger smoothness (GCN with  $D_{p} = 2D_{t}$ ) is similar to the vanilla GCN, which on the contrary implies that the over-smoothing issue may not be the major cause for performance degradation of deep GNNs until the graph smoothness achieves an extremely high level (e.g.,  $D_{p} > 16$  on the PubMed dataset).

Enlarging  $D_p$  in SGC. To further validate our guess, we increase the number of propagation depth  $D_p$  of SGC and then evaluate the corresponding predictive accuracy and the value of  $GSL$  defined

![](images/335f8a10f17d23099c036a62a2116b72965c6f14a4a43f5ed7a796192403f891.jpg)

in Sec. 3. We present the evaluation results in Fig. 2(b). By increasing  $D_{p}$  from 1 to 10, the value of  $GSL$  has decreased by more than  $60\%$ , but the corresponding predictive accuracy decline is less than  $1\%$ . This sharp contrast strongly illustrates that low  $GSL$ , i.e., the over-smoothing issue, is not the main cause for the performance degradation of deep GNNs. Moreover, compared with 10-layer vanilla GCN in Fig. 2(a), the corresponding predictive accuracy of 10-layer SGC is still quite high even with the same  $D_{p}$  as vanilla GCN. Therefore, we further guess that the large  $D_{t}$  may be the root cause for the performance degradation of deep vanilla GCNs.

Large  $D_{t}$  Dominates Performance Degradation. To dig out the true limitation of deep GCNs, we fix the number of transformation depth  $D_{t}$  to 2 and set the normalized adjacency matrix to  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}^{D_p / 2}$  (when  $D_{p}$  is odd, use  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}^{\lfloor D_p / 2\rfloor +1}$  in the first layer and  $\hat{\mathbf{A}}^{\lfloor D_p / 2\rfloor}$  in the second layer), and then report the accuracy along with the increased propagation depth  $D_{p}$ . The experimental results in Fig. 2(c) shows that the accuracy of GCN with  $D_{t} = 2$  does not drop quickly when  $D_{p}$  becomes large, while it faces a sharp decline in vanilla GCN, which fixes  $D_{p} = D_{t}$ . Individually enlarging  $D_{p}$  will increase the risk of the over-smoothing issue, but the accuracy is only slightly influenced. However, the performance of vanilla GCN experiences a drastic drop if we simultaneously increase  $D_{t}$ .

Findings 1: Large  $D_{p}$  will harm the predictive accuracy of deep GNN, yet the accuracy decline is relatively small. On the contrary, large  $D_{t}$  is the root cause for the failure of deep GNNs.

# 4.2 WHAT'S BEHIND LARGE  $D_{t}$ ?

To learn what is the fundamental problem caused by large  $D_{t}$ , we first evaluate the predictive accuracy of deep MLP on the PubMed dataset and then move the research object to deep GNN.

Deep MLP Also Performs Bad. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of MLP along with  $D_{t}$ , i.e., the number of MLP layers, on the PubMed dataset, and the black line in Fig. 3(a) shows the evaluation results. It can be easily drawn from the results that the predictive accuracy of MLP also decreases sharply when  $D_{t}$  increases. Thus, the performance degradation caused by large  $D_{t}$  also exists in MLP. It reminds us that the approaches easing the training of deep MLP might also help alleviate the performance degradation caused by large  $D_{t}$  in GNN.

Skip Connections Can Help. The widely-used approach that eases the training of deep MLP is to add skip connections between layers (He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017). Here, we add residual and dense connections to MLP and generate two MLP variants: "MLP+Res" and "MLP+Dense", respectively. The accuracy of these two models with increasing  $D_{t}$  is shown in Fig. 3(a). Compared with plain deep MLP, the accuracy of both "MLP+Res" and "MLP+Dense" does not encounter huge degradation when  $D_{t}$  increases. The results illustrate that adding residual or dense connections can effectively alleviate the performance degradation issue caused by large  $D_{t}$ .

Model Degradation. The skip connections are first introduced in (He et al., 2016) to alleviate the model degradation issue, which is a phenomenon that the accuracy firstly increases and then decreases rapidly when increasing the number of layers in one model. Surprisingly, the degradation is not caused by overfitting as the training error becomes higher when adding more layers in the model. Adopting the same approach to alleviate the model degradation issue, we add residual and dense connections to GCN and generate two GCN variants: "ResGCN" and "DenseGCN", respectively. The accuracy results in Fig. 3(b) illustrate that the performance decline of both "ResGCN" and "DenseGCN" can be ignored compared to the huge accuracy decline of vanilla GCN.

Figure 4: Different nodes reach their optimal performance at varied propagation depth  $D_{p}$ . Findings 2: The model degradation issue behind large  $D_{t}$  is the true root cause for the failure of deep GNNs. And adding skip connections between layers can effectively alleviate the performance degradation issue of deep GNNs.

# 5 GUIDELINES ON CONSTRUCTING DEEP GNNS

In this section, we propose several guidelines on how to construct deep GNNs that support large propagation depth  $D_{p}$  and large transformation depth  $D_{t}$  based on the experimental analysis in Sec. 4. Further Discussions about when to adopt deep GNNs can be found in Appendix B.

# 5.1 A MORE FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK

Many recent GNN works follow the framework design proposed by SGC (Wu et al., 2019) which decouples the EP and ET operations inside each GNN layer. The decoupled design split the framework into two components. In the most popular decoupled GNN design, the first component executes the EP operation in a certain manner to generate propagated node features. Then the propagated features are then fed into the second component to execute ET operations. The second component is usually a plain MLP. There are several other methods (Klicpera et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020) that exchange the order of the two components mentioned above. Under the decoupled framework, the choices of  $D_{p}$  and  $D_{t}$  are more flexible as it breaks the limit that  $D_{p} = D_{t}$ . Thus, for different kinds of graph-structured data, the decoupled framework is able to adopt different values of  $D_{p}$  and  $D_{t}$  for optimal predictive accuracy. For example,  $\mathrm{S}^2\mathrm{GC}$  (Zhu & Koniusz, 2021) and GBP (Chen et al., 2020b) first execute the EP operations to generate propagated features at different  $D_{p}$ . Then they adopt a heuristic weighting mechanism to combine these propagated features. Finally, the combined features are fed into a plain MLP to get the prediction results.

Guidelines 1: The decoupled framework should be adopted to free the choices of  $D_{p}$  and  $D_{t}$  from the restraint that  $D_{p} = D_{t}$  in order to adapt to the characteristics of different datasets.

# 5.2 HOW TO CONSTRUCT GNNS WITH LARGE  $D_p$ ?

Despite the effectiveness of previous works, a problem still exists: when combining propagated features, the weighting mechanism works at the graph level rather than at the node level. For example, the weighting mechanism in  $S^2GC$  (Zhu & Koniusz, 2021) and GBP (Chen et al., 2020b) is sub-optimal as it assigns the same weight distribution to all the nodes when combining propagated features at different propagation steps. As a result, the individual properties of each node are ignored. To verify our claim, we apply SGC for the node classification task with different propagation depths on 12 randomly selected nodes in the Cora dataset. We run SGC 100 times and report the average accuracy of the selected nodes. We observe from Fig. 4 that the optimal propagation depths for the selected nodes are highly diverse. The results demonstrate that different nodes should have different weight distributions along with  $D_p$  to get the optimal predictive accuracy.

Guidelines 2: A node-adaptive weighting mechanism should be adopted to satisfy each node's diverse needs for the propagation depth  $D_{p}$  when constructing deep GNNs.

# 5.3 HOW TO CONSTRUCT GNNS WITH LARGE  $D_{t}$ ?

Recently, lines of works have been proposed to support large  $D_{t}$ , and many of them add skip connections between GNN layers motivated by ResNet (He et al., 2016) and DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017). For example, JK-Net (Xu et al., 2018) proposes a new transformation scheme for node embeddings that combines all node embeddings at previous layers in the final layer. GCNII (Chen

et al., 2020c) addresses small  $D_{t}$  via initial residual connections and identity mappings. Besides, as shown in Fig. 3(b), vanilla GCN with residual or dense connections is also able to support large  $D_{t}$ .

Guidelines 3: Adding skip connections between GNN layers is an effective way for GNN models to support large  $D_{t}$ .

# 6 ONE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION

Under the guidance of the above guidelines, we propose a scalable and flexible model termed Deep Graph Multi-Layer Perceptron (DGMLP), which contains a node-adaptive weighting mechanism for large  $D_{p}$  and the residual connections for large  $D_{t}$ . Following the decoupled framework, DGMLP first calculates the propagated features at different  $D_{p}$  using the EP operation. Then a novel node-adaptive weighting mechanism is proposed to combine the propagated features at different  $D_{p}$  effectively. Finally, the combined feature is fed into an MLP with added skip connections to support large  $D_{t}$ . The remainder of this section will introduce the node-adaptive weighting mechanism and the skip connections adopted in DGMLP in detail.

# 6.1 NODE-ADAPTIVE WEIGHTING MECHANISM

After generating the propagated features  $\mathbf{X}^{(k)} = \hat{\mathbf{A}}^k\mathbf{X}$  for propagation depth  $k$  ranges from 1 to  $K$  using the EP operation, we further calculate the  $NSL_{v}(k)$  parameterized by node  $v$  and propagation depth  $k$  defined in Def. 3.1. Remember that smaller  $NSL_{v}(k)$  means that the node embedding at propagation step  $k$  is more likely to forget the original node feature information and has a higher risk of the over-smoothing issue. Thus, in this case, propagated feature at propagation step  $k$ ,  $\mathbf{x}_v^k$  should be intuitively assigned with smaller weights. To restrain the weights in between 0 and 1, the propagation weight  $w_{v}(k)$  parameterized by node  $v$  and propagation step  $k$  is defined as the softmax output of  $\{NSL_v(0), NSL_v(1), \dots, NSL_v(K)\}$ :

$$
w _ {v} (k) = \frac {e ^ {N S L _ {v} (k) / T}}{\sum_ {l = 0} ^ {K} e ^ {N S L _ {v} (l) / T}}. \tag {7}
$$

Similar to Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015; Lan et al., 2018), the temperature  $T$  is adopted here to soften or harden the probability distributions. Smaller  $T$  will harden the distributions, and thus the model will focus more on the local graph information.

Finally, the propagated features at different  $D_{p}$  are combined using the weight  $w_{v}(k)$  in Eq. 7 to generate the combined feature  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_v = \sum_{k=0}^{K} w_v(k) \mathbf{x}_v^k$ . By adaptively assigning different propagation weights for different nodes, we can simply increase  $D_{p}$  on the graph level and get more powerful node embeddings with personalized smoothing levels for each node.

# 6.2 SKIP CONNECTIONS

Following guidelines 3, we choose to add residual connections (He et al., 2016) between the layers in the MLP of our DGMLP. We refer to the layers in the MLP of our DGMLP as the following format:

$$
\mathbf {h} _ {v} ^ {(l + 1)} = \sigma \left(\mathbf {h} _ {v} ^ {(l)} \mathbf {W} ^ {(l)}\right) + \mathbf {h} _ {v} ^ {(l)}, \tag {8}
$$

where  $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$  is the learnable parameter matrix,  $\mathbf{h}_v^{(0)} = \hat{\mathbf{x}}_v$  is the original combined node feature vector, and  $\mathbf{h}_v^{(l)}$  is the transformed node embeddings at the  $l$ -th layer of the MLP with residual connections.

# 7 DGMLP EVALUATION

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed DGMLP. We first introduce the utilized datasets and experiment setup. Then, we compare DGMLP with state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy, scalability, and model depth. More experimental results about efficiency, graph sparsity, and interpretability of DGMLP can be found in Appendix E.

# 7.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

Datasets. We adopt the three popular citation network datasets (Cora, Citeseer, PubMed) (Sen et al., 2008), three large OGB datasets (ogbn-arxiv, ogbn-products, ogbn-papers100M) (Hu et al., 2020), and one Industry dataset from our industrial cooperative enterprise in our evaluation. Table 7 in Appendix D.1 presents an overview of these seven datasets.

Baselines. We choose the following baselines: GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2016), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), JK-Net (Xu et al., 2018), ResGCN (Li et al., 2019), APPNP (Klicpera et al., 2018), AP-GCN (Spinelli et al., 2020), DAGNN (Liu et al., 2020), SGC (Wu et al., 2019), SIGN (Frasca et al., 2020),  $\mathrm{S}^2\mathrm{GC}$  (Zhu & Koniusz, 2021), and GBP (Chen et al., 2020b). The hyperparameter details for our DGMLP and all the baseline methods can be found in Appendix D.2.

# 7.2 END-TO-END COMPARISON

The classification results on three citation networks are shown in Table 1. We observe that DGMLP outperforms all the compared baseline methods. Notably, the predictive accuracy of DGMLP exceeds the one of current state-of-the-art method GBP by a margin of  $0.6\%$  on the largest citation networks dataset, PubMed. Compared with coupled methods (e.g., GCN, JK-Net), the decoupled methods (e.g., DAGNN, GBP) get better predictive accuracy. It is due to the fact that the disentanglement of EP and ET operations enables  $D_{p}$  to go extremely deep, exploiting more deep structural information.

We further evaluate DGMLP on the three large OGB datasets and one Industry dataset, and the results are also summarized in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, DGMLP consistently achieves the best performance across the four large datasets. The improvement of DGMLP over baseline methods mainly relies on its support of both large  $D_{p}$  and large  $D_{t}$ .

# 7.3 TRAINING SCALABILITY

To test the scalability of DGMLP, we use the Erdős-Rényi graph (Erdos et al., 1960) generator in the Python package NetworkX (Hagberg et al., 2008) to generate artificial graphs of different sizes. The node sizes of the generated artificial graphs vary from 0.1 million to 1 million, and the probability of an edge exists between two nodes is set to 0.0001. We choose two representative methods GCN and APPNP as compared baselines. The total running time (including the pre-processing time) of training for 200 epochs and the GPU memory requirement are shown in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b), respectively. The running time speedup of DGMLP against GCN is also included in Fig. 5(a).

The experimental results in Fig. 5(a) illustrate that DGMLP is highly efficient compared to GCN and APPNP. It only takes DGMLP 223.4 seconds to finish the training on a large graph of size 1 million, which is less than the running time of both GCN and APPNP on the graph of size 0.3 million. Fig. 5(b) shows that the GPU memory requirement of DGMLP grows almost linearly along with graph size. On the contrary, the GPU memory requirements of GCN and APPNP both grow much quicker than DGMLP, exceeding 16GB when the graph size is 1 million, while the memory requirement of DGMLP is just over 3GB at the same graph size. It indicates that our proposed DGMLP enjoys high scalability and high efficiency at the same time.

# 7.4 ANALYSIS OF MODEL DEPTH

In this subsection, we conduct experiments to validate that our proposed DGMLP can support both large  $D_{p}$  and large  $D_{t}$ . We choose SGC, DAGNN, and  $\mathbf{S}^2\mathrm{GC}$  as baseline methods.

Firstly, we fix  $D_{t}$  to 3 and increase  $D_{p}$  from 1 to 20 on the ogbn-arxiv dataset. As seen from Fig. 6(a), SGC cannot perform well when  $D_{p}$  goes deep as the over-smoothing issue occurs. The predictive accuracy of DAGNN,  $\mathrm{S}^2\mathrm{GC}$ , and our DGMLP maintains high when  $D_{p}$  becomes large. Moreover, DGMLP consistently outperforms all the baseline methods when  $D_{p}$  is greater than 6. The superiority of our DGMLP over DAGNN and  $\mathrm{S}^2\mathrm{GC}$  lies in that we adopt a node-adaptive combination mechanism to satisfy the diverse needs of different nodes for propagation depth  $D_{p}$ .

Secondly, we fix  $D_p$  to 10 and increase  $D_t$  from 1 to 10. Fig. 6(b) shows that the predictive accuracy of all the baseline methods, including SGC, DAGNN, and  $\mathrm{S}^2\mathrm{GC}$  decreases rapidly when  $D_t$  becomes large. It is because that these methods do not take the model degradation issue into consideration, which is precisely the main contributor to the performance degradation when  $D_t$  is large. This property limits the expressive power of these baseline methods, resulting in relatively low performance when adopted on large graphs. In the meantime, the performance of our proposed DGMLP still increases steadily or maintains even when  $D_t$  is large. To sum up, compared with other baseline methods, our DGMLP can consistently improve predictive accuracy with larger  $D_p$  or  $D_t$ , which validates our experimental analysis and guidelines in Sec. 4 and 5.

# 8 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we perform an experimental evaluation of current GNNs and find the root cause for the failure of deep GNNs: the model degradation issue introduced by large transformation depth. The over-smoothing issue introduced by large propagation depth does harm the predictive accuracy. However, GNN is much more sensitive to the model degradation issue than the over-smoothing issue, i.e., the model degradation issue happens much earlier than the over-smoothing issue as  $D_{p}$  and  $D_{t}$  increases at the same speed. Based on the above analysis, we present Deep Graph Multi-Layer Perceptron (DGMLP), a flexible and deep GNN model that simultaneously supports large propagation and transformation depth. Extensive experiments on seven real-world graph datasets demonstrate that DGMLP outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs, and enjoys high scalability and efficiency at the same time.
