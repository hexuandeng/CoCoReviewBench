# ABSTRACT

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a widely used framework for learning generative models. Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), one of the most successful variants of GANs, require solving a minmax optimization problem to global optimality, but are in practice successfully trained using stochastic gradient descent-ascent. In this paper, we show that, when the generator is a one-layer network, stochastic gradient descent-ascent converges to a global solution with polynomial time and sample complexity.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) are a prominent framework for learning generative models of complex, real-world distributions given samples from these distributions. GANs and their variants have been successfully applied to numerous datasets and tasks, including image-to-image translation (Isola et al., 2017), image super-resolution (Ledig et al., 2017), domain adaptation (Tzeng et al., 2017), probabilistic inference (Dumoulin et al., 2016), compressed sensing (Bora et al., 2017) and many more. These advances owe in part to the success of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Gulrajani et al., 2017), leveraging the neural net induced integral probability metric to better measure the difference between a target and a generated distribution.

Along with the afore-described empirical successes, there have been theoretical studies of the statistical properties of GANs—see e.g. (Zhang et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2017; 2018; Bai et al., 2018; Dumoulin et al., 2016) and their references. These works have shown that, with an appropriate design of the generator and discriminator, the global optimum of the WGAN objective identifies the target distribution with low sample complexity.

On the algorithmic front, prior work has focused on the stability and convergence properties of gradient descent-ascent (GDA) and its variants in GAN training and more general min-max optimization problems; see e.g. (Nagarajan & Kolter, 2017; Heusel et al., 2017; Mescheder et al., 2017; 2018; Daskalakis et al., 2017; Daskalakis & Panageas, 2018a,b; Gidel et al., 2019; Liang & Stokes, 2019; Mokhtari et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019) and their references. It is known that, even in min-max optimization problems with convex-concave objectives, GDA may fail to compute the min-max solution and may even exhibit divergent behavior. Hence, these works have studied conditions under which GDA converges to a globally optimal solution under a convex-concave objective, or different types of locally optimal solutions under nonconvex-concave or nonconvex-nonconcave objectives. They have also identified variants of GDA with better stability properties in both theory and practice, most notably those using negative momentum.

In the context of GAN training, Feizi et al. (2017) show that for WGANs with a linear generator and quadratic discriminator GDA succeeds in learning a Gaussian using polynomially many samples in the dimension. In the same vein, we are the first to our knowledge to study the global convergence properties of stochastic GDA in the GAN setting, and establishing such guarantees for non-linear generators. In particular, we study the WGAN formulation for learning a single-layer generative model with some reasonable choices of activations including tanh, sigmoid and leaky ReLU.

Our contributions. For WGAN with a one-layer generator network using an activation from a large family of functions and a quadratic discriminator, we show that stochastic gradient descent-ascent learns a target distribution using polynomial time and samples, under the assumption that the target distribution is realizable in the architecture of the generator. This is achieved by a) analysis of the dynamics of stochastic gradient-descent to show it attains a global optimum of the minmax problem, and b) appropriate design of the discriminator to ensure a parametric  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$  statistical rate (Zhang et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2018).

Related Work. We briefly review relevant results in GAN training and learning generative models:

- Optimization viewpoint. For standard GANs and WGANs with appropriate regularization, Nagarajan & Kolter (2017), Mescheder et al. (2017) and Heusel et al. (2017) establish sufficient conditions to achieve local convergence and stability properties for GAN training. At the equilibrium point, if the Jacobian of the associated gradient vector field has only eigenvalues with negative real-part at the equilibrium point, GAN training is verified to converge locally for small enough learning rates. A follow-up paper by (Mescheder et al., 2018) shows the necessity of these conditions by identifying a prototypical counterexample that is not always locally convergent with gradient descent based GAN optimization. However, the lack of global convergence prevents the analysis to provide any guarantees of learning the real distribution.

The work of (Feizi et al., 2017) described above has similar goals as our paper, namely understanding the convergence properties of basic dynamics in simple WGAN formulations. However, they only consider linear generators, which restrict the WGAN model to learning a Gaussian. Our work goes a step further, considering WGANs whose generators are one-layer neural networks with a broad selection of activations. We show that with a proper gradient-based algorithm, we can still recover the ground truth parameters of the underlying distribution.

More broadly, WGANs typically result in nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization problems. In these problems, a global min-max solution may not exist, and there are various notions of local min-max solutions, namely local min-local max solutions Daskalakis & Panageas (2018b), and local min solutions of the max objective Jin et al. (2019), the latter being guaranteed to exist under mild conditions. In fact, Lin et al. (2019) show that GDA is able to find stationary points of the max objective in nonconvex-concave objectives. Given that GDA may not even converge for convex-concave objectives, another line of work has studied variants of GDA that exhibit global convergence to the min-max solution Daskalakis et al. (2017); Daskalakis & Panageas (2018a); Gidel et al. (2019); Liang & Stokes (2019); Mokhtari et al. (2019), which is established for GDA variants that add negative momentum to the dynamics. While the convergence of GDA with negative momentum is shown in convex-concave settings, there is experimental evidence supporting that it improves GAN training (Daskalakis et al., 2017; Gidel et al., 2019).

- Statistical viewpoint. Several works have studied the issue of mode collapse. One might doubt the ability of GANs to actually learn the distribution vs just memorize the training data (Arora et al., 2017; 2018; Dumoulin et al., 2016). Some corresponding cures have been proposed. For instance, Zhang et al. (2018); Bai et al. (2018) show for specific generators combined with appropriate parametric discriminator design, WGANs can attain parametric statistical rates, avoiding the exponential in dimension sample complexity (Liang, 2018; Bai et al., 2018; Feizi et al., 2017).

Recent work of Wu et al. (2019) provides an algorithm to learn the distribution of a single-layer ReLU generator network. While our conclusion appears similar, our focus is very different. Our paper targets understanding when a WGAN formulation trained with stochastic GDA can learn in polynomial time and sample complexity. Their work instead relies on a specifically tailored algorithm for learning truncated normal distributions Daskalakis et al. (2018).

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

We consider GAN formulations for learning a generator  $G_{A}:\mathbb{R}^{k}\to \mathbb{R}^{d}$  of the form  $\pmb {z}\mapsto \pmb {x} = \phi (A\pmb {z})$  where  $A$  is a  $d\times k$  parameter matrix and  $\phi$  some activation function. We consider discriminators  $D_{\pmb{v}}:\mathbb{R}^{d}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$  or  $D_V:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}$  that are linear or quadratic forms respectively for the different purposes of learning the marginals or the joint distribution. We assume latent variables  $\pmb{z}$  are sampled from the normal  $\mathcal{N}(0,I_{k\times k})$ , where  $I_{k\times k}$  denotes the identity matrix of size  $k$ . The real/target distribution outputs samples  $\pmb{x}\sim \mathcal{D} = G_{A^{*}}(\mathcal{N}(0,I_{k_{0}\times k_{0}}))$ , for some ground truth parameters  $A^{*}$  where  $A^{*}$  is  $d\times k_0$ , and we take  $k\geq k_{0}$  for enough expressivity, taking  $k = d$  when  $k_{0}$  is unknown.

The Wasserstein GAN under our choice of generator and discriminator is naturally formulated as:

$$
\min  _ {A \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d \times k}} \max  _ {\boldsymbol {v} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} \left\{f (A, \boldsymbol {v}) \equiv \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {x} \sim \mathcal {D}} D _ {\boldsymbol {v}} (\boldsymbol {x}) - \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z} \sim \mathcal {N} (0, I _ {k \times k})} D _ {\boldsymbol {v}} (G _ {A} (\boldsymbol {z})) \right\}. ^ {1}
$$

We use  $\mathbf{a}_i$  to denote the  $i$ -th row vector of  $A$ . We sometimes omit the 2 subscript, using  $\| \mathbf{x} \|$  to denote the 2-norm of vector  $\mathbf{x}$ , and  $\| X \|$  to denote the spectral norm of matrix  $X$ .  $\mathbb{S}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  represents all the symmetric matrices of dimension  $n \times n$ . We use  $Df(X_0)[B]$  to denote the directional derivative of function  $f$  at point  $X_0$  with direction  $B$ :  $Df(X_0)[B] = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(X_0 + tB) - f(X_0)}{t}$ .

# 3 WARM-UP: LEARNING THE MARGINAL DISTRIBUTIONS

As a warm-up, we ask whether a simple linear discriminator is sufficient for the purposes of learning the marginal distributions of all coordinates of  $\mathcal{D}$ . Notice that in our setting, the  $i$ -th output of the generator is  $\phi(x)$  where  $x \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \|a_i\|^2)$ , and is thus solely determined by  $\|a_i\|_2$ . With a linear discriminator  $D_v(\pmb{x}) = \pmb{v}^\top \pmb{x}$ , our minimax game becomes:

$$
\min  _ {A \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d \times k}} \max  _ {\boldsymbol {v} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} \left\{f _ {1} (A, \boldsymbol {v}) \equiv \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {x} \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \boldsymbol {v} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {x} \right] - \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(0, I _ {k \times k}\right)} \left[ \boldsymbol {v} ^ {\top} \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) \right] \right\}. \tag {1}
$$

Notice that when the activation  $\phi$  is an odd function, such as the tanh activation, the symmetric property of the Gaussian distribution ensures that  $\mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x} \sim \mathcal{D}}[\boldsymbol{v}^\top \boldsymbol{x}] = 0$ , hence the linear discriminator in  $f_1$  reveals no information about  $A^*$ . Therefore specifically for odd activations (or odd plus a constant activations), we instead use an adjusted rectified linear discriminator  $D_{\boldsymbol{v}}(\boldsymbol{x}) \equiv \boldsymbol{v}^\top R(\boldsymbol{x} - C)$  to enforce some bias, where  $C = \frac{1}{2} (\phi(x) + \phi(-x))$  for all  $x$ , and  $R$  denotes the ReLU activation. Formally, we slightly modify our loss function as:

$$
\bar {f} _ {1} (A, \boldsymbol {v}) \equiv \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {x} \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \boldsymbol {v} ^ {\top} R (\boldsymbol {x} - C) \right] - \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(0, I _ {k \times k}\right)} \left[ \boldsymbol {v} ^ {\top} R (\phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) - C) \right]. \tag {2}
$$

We will show that we can learn each marginal of  $\mathcal{D}$  if the activation function  $\phi$  satisfies the following.

Assumption 1. The activation function  $\phi$  satisfies either one of the following:

1.  $\phi$  is an odd function plus constant, and  $\phi$  is monotone increasing;  
2. The even component of  $\phi$ , i.e.  $\frac{1}{2} (\phi(x) + \phi(-x))$ , is positive and monotone increasing on  $x \in [0, \infty)$ .

Remark 1. All common activation functions like (Leaky) ReLU, tanh or sigmoid function satisfy Assumption 1.

Lemma 1. Suppose  $A^* \neq 0$ . Consider  $f_1$  with activation that satisfies Assumption 1.2 and  $\bar{f}_1$  with activation that satisfies Assumption 1.1. The stationary points of such  $f_1$  and  $\bar{f}_1$  yield parameters  $A$  satisfying  $\| \pmb{a}_i \| = \| \pmb{a}_i^* \|, \forall i \in [d]$ .

To bound the capacity of the discriminator, similar to the Lipschitz constraint in WGAN, we regularize the discriminator. For the regularized formulation we have:

Theorem 1. In the same setting as Lemma 1, alternating gradient descent-ascent with proper learning rates on

$$
\min  _ {A} \max  _ {\boldsymbol {v}} \{f _ {1} (A, \boldsymbol {v}) - \| \boldsymbol {v} \| ^ {2} / 2 \} \quad o r \text {r e s p e c t i v e l y} \quad \min  _ {A} \max  _ {\boldsymbol {v}} \{\bar {f} _ {1} (A, \boldsymbol {v}) - \| \boldsymbol {v} \| ^ {2} / 2 \}
$$

recovers  $A$  such that  $\| \pmb{a}_i\| = \| \pmb{a}_i^*\| ,\forall i\in [d]$

All the proofs of the paper can be found in the appendix. We show that all local min-max points in the sense of (Jin et al., 2019) of the original problem are global min-max points and recover the correct norm of  $\pmb{a}_i^*$ ,  $\forall i$ . Notice for the source data distribution  $\pmb{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_d) \sim \mathcal{D}$  with activation  $\phi$ , the marginal distribution of each  $x_i$  follows  $\phi(\mathcal{N}(0, \| \pmb{a}_i^* \|^2))$  and is determined by  $\| \pmb{a}_i^* \|$ . Therefore we have learned the marginal distribution for each entry  $i$ . It remains to learn the joint distribution.

# 4 LEARNING THE JOINT DISTRIBUTION

In the previous section, we utilize a (rectified) linear discriminator, such that each coordinate  $v_{i}$  interacts with the  $i$ -th random variable. With the (rectified) linear discriminator, WGAN learns the correct  $\| \pmb{a}_i\|$ , for all  $i$ . However, since there's no interaction between different coordinates of the random vector, we do not expect to learn the joint distribution with a linear discriminator.

To proceed, a natural idea is to use a quadratic discriminator  $D_V(\pmb{x}) \coloneqq \pmb{x}^\top V\pmb{x} = \langle \pmb{x}\pmb{x}^\top, V \rangle$  to enforce component interactions. Similar to the previous section, we study the regularized version:

$$
\min  _ {A \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d \times k}} \max  _ {V \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d \times d}} \left\{f _ {2} (A, V) - \frac {1}{2} \| V \| _ {F} ^ {2} \right\}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $f_{2}(A,V) = \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x}\sim \mathcal{D}}D_{V}(\boldsymbol {x}) - \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I_{k\times k})}D_{V}(\phi (A\boldsymbol {z}))$

$$
= \left\langle \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {x} \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \boldsymbol {x} \boldsymbol {x} ^ {\top} \right] - \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(0, I _ {k \times k}\right)} \left[ \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) ^ {\top} \right], V \right\rangle .
$$

By adding a regularizer on  $V$  and explicitly maximizing over  $V$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} g (A) \equiv \max  _ {V} \left\{f _ {2} (A, V) - \frac {1}{2} \| V \| _ {F} ^ {2} \right\} \\ = \frac {1}{2} \left\| \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {x} \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \boldsymbol {x x} ^ {\top} \right] - \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z} \sim \mathcal {N} (0, I _ {k \times k})} \left[ \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) ^ {\top} \right] \right\| _ {F} ^ {2}. \\ \end{array}
$$

In the next subsection, we first focus on analyzing the second-order stationary points of  $g$ , then we establish that gradient descent ascent converges to second-order stationary points of  $g$ .

# 4.1 GLOBAL CONVERGENCE FOR OPTIMIZING THE GENERATING PARAMETERS

We first assume that both  $A$  and  $A^*$  have unit row vectors, and then extend to general case since we already know how to learn the row norms from Section 3. To explicitly compute  $g(A)$ , we rely on the property of Hermite polynomials. Since normalized Hermite polynomials  $\{h_i\}_{i=0}^{\infty}$  forms an orthonormal basis in the functional space, we rewrite the activation function as  $\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \sigma_i h_i$ , where  $\sigma_i$  is the  $i$ -th Hermite coefficient. We use the following claim:

Claim 1 ((Ge et al., 2017) Claim 4.2). Let  $\phi$  be a function from  $\mathbb{R}$  to  $\mathbb{R}$  such that  $\phi \in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}, e^{-x^{2}/2})$ , and let its Hermite expansion be  $\phi = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \sigma_{i} h_{i}$ . Then, for any unit vectors  $\mathbf{u}$ ,  $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ , we have that

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {x} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(0, I _ {d \times d}\right)} \left[ \phi (\boldsymbol {u} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {x}) \phi (\boldsymbol {v} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {x}) \right] = \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\infty} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} (\boldsymbol {u} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {v}) ^ {i}.
$$

Therefore we could compute the value of  $f_{2}$  explicitly using the Hermite polynomial expansion:

$$
f _ {2} (A, V) = \left\langle \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\infty} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} \left(\left(A ^ {*} \left(A ^ {*}\right) ^ {\top}\right) ^ {\circ i} - \left(A A ^ {\top}\right) ^ {\circ i}\right), V \right\rangle .
$$

Here  $X^{\circ i}$  is the Hadamard power operation where  $(X^{\circ i})_{jk} = (X_{jk})^{i}$ . Therefore we have:

$$
g (A) = \frac {1}{2} \left\| \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\infty} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} \left((A ^ {*} (A ^ {*}) ^ {\top}) ^ {\circ i} - (A A ^ {\top}) ^ {\circ i}\right) \right\| _ {F} ^ {2}
$$

We reparametrize with  $Z = AA^{\top}$  and define  $\tilde{g}(Z) = g(A)$  with individual component functions  $\tilde{g}_{jk}(z) \equiv \frac{1}{2} (\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \sigma_i^2 ((z_{jk}^*)^i - z^i))^2$ . Accordingly  $z_{jk}^* = \langle \pmb{a}_j^*, \pmb{a}_k^* \rangle$  is the  $(j, k)$ -th component of the ground truth covariance matrix  $A^*(A^*)^\top$ .

Assumption 2. The activation function  $\phi$  is an odd function plus constant. In other words, its Hermite expansion  $\phi = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \sigma_i h_i$  satisfies  $\sigma_i = 0$  for even  $i \geq 2$ . Additionally we assume  $\sigma_1 \neq 0$ .

Remark 2. Common activations like tanh and sigmoid satisfy Assumption 2.

Lemma 2. For activations including leaky ReLU and functions satisfying Assumption 2,  $\tilde{g}(Z)$  has a unique stationary point where  $Z = A^{*}(A^{*})^{\top}$ .

Notice  $\tilde{g}(Z) = \sum_{jk} \tilde{g}_{jk}(z_{jk})$  is separable across  $z_{jk}$ , where each  $\tilde{g}_{jk}$  is a polynomial scalar function. Lemma 2 comes from the fact that the only zero point for  $\tilde{g}_{jk}'$  is  $z_{jk} = z_{jk}^*$ , for odd activation  $\phi$  and leaky ReLU. Then we migrate this good property to the original problem we want to solve:

Problem 1. We optimize over function  $g$  when  $\| \pmb{a}_i^* \| = 1, \forall i$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} \min  _ {A} \quad \left\{g (A) = \frac {1}{2} \left\| \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\infty} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} \left(\left(A ^ {*} \left(A ^ {*}\right) ^ {\top}\right) ^ {\circ i} - \left(A A ^ {\top}\right) ^ {\circ i}\right) \right\| _ {F} ^ {2} \right\} \\ s. t. \quad \boldsymbol {a} _ {i} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {a} _ {i} = 1, \forall i. \\ \end{array}
$$

Existing work Journée et al. (2008) connects  $\tilde{g}(Z)$  to the optimization over factorized version for  $g(A)$  ( $g(A) \equiv \tilde{g}(AA^{\top})$ ). Specifically, when  $k = d$ , all second-order stationary points for  $g(A)$  are first-order stationary points for  $\tilde{g}(Z)$ . Though  $\tilde{g}$  is not convex, we are able to show that its first-order stationary points are global optima when the generator is sufficiently expressive, i.e.,  $k \geq k_0$ . In reality we won't know the latent dimension  $k_0$ , therefore we just choose  $k = d$  for simplicity. We make the following conclusion:

Theorem 2. For activations including leaky ReLU and functions satisfying Assumption 2, when  $k = d$ , all second-order KKT points for problem 1 are its global minimum. Therefore alternating projected gradient descent-ascent on Eqn. (3) converges to  $A:AA^{\top} = A^{*}(A^{*})^{\top}$ .

The extension for non-unit vectors is straightforward, and we defer the analysis to the Appendix.

$$

8: end for

9: Output:  $A^{(T)}(A^{(T)})^\top$

In this section, we consider analyzing Algorithm 1, i.e., gradient descent ascent on the following:

$$
\tilde {f} _ {m, n} ^ {(t)} (A, V) = \left\langle \frac {1}{m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \phi \left(A \boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {(t)}\right) \phi \left(A \boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {(t)}\right) ^ {\top} - \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {\top}, V \right\rangle - \frac {1}{2} \| V \| ^ {2}. \tag {4}
$$

Notice in each iteration, gradient ascent with step-size 1 finds the optimal solution for  $V$ . By Danskin's theorem (Danskin, 2012), our min-max optimization is essentially gradient descent over  $\tilde{g}_{m,n}^{(t)}(A) \equiv \max_V \tilde{f}_{m,n}^{(t)}(A, V) = \frac{1}{2} \| \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \phi(Az_i^{(t)}) \phi(Az_i^{(t)})^\top - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i^\top \|_F^2$  with a batch of samples  $\{\pmb{z}_i^{(t)}\}$ , i.e., stochastic gradient descent for  $f_n(A) \equiv \mathbb{E}_{\pmb{z}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_{k \times k}), \forall i \in [m]} [\tilde{g}_{m,n}(A)]$ .

Therefore to bound the difference between  $f_{n}(A)$  and the population risk  $g(A)$ , we analyze the sample complexity required on the observation side ( $\pmb{x}_i \sim \mathcal{D}, i \in [n]$ ) and the mini-batch size required on the learning part ( $\phi(A\pmb{z}_j), \pmb{z}_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_{k \times k}), j \in [m]$ ). We will show that with large enough  $n, m$ , the algorithm specified in Algorithm 1 that optimizes over the empirical risk will yield the ground truth covariance matrix with high probability.

Our proof sketch is roughly as follows:

1. With high probability, projected stochastic gradient descent finds a second order stationary point  $\hat{A}$  of  $f_{n}(\cdot)$  as shown in Theorem 31 of (Ge et al., 2015).

2. For sufficiently large  $m$ , our empirical objective, though a biased estimator of the population risk  $g(\cdot)$ , achieves good  $\epsilon$ -approximation to the population risk on both the gradient and Hessian (Lemmas 4&5). Therefore  $\hat{A}$  is also an  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ -approximate second order stationary point (SOSP) for the population risk  $g(A)$ .  
3. We show that any  $\epsilon$ -SOSP  $\hat{A}$  for  $g(A)$  yields an  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ -first order stationary point (FOSP)  $\hat{Z} \equiv \hat{A}\hat{A}^{\top}$  for the semi-definite programming on  $\tilde{g}(Z)$  (Lemma 6).  
4. We show that any  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ -FOSP of function  $\tilde{g}(Z)$  induces at most  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$  absolute error compared to the ground truth covariance matrix  $Z^{*} = A^{*}(A^{*})^{\top}$  (Lemma 7).

# 5.1 OBSERVATION SAMPLE COMPLEXITY

For simplicity, we assume the activation and its gradient satisfy Lipschitz continuous, and let the Lipschitz constants be 1 w.l.o.g.:

Assumption 3. Assume the activation is 1-Lipschitz and 1-smooth.

To estimate observation sample complexity, we will bound the gradient and Hessian for the population risk and empirical risk on the observation samples:

$$
\begin{array}{l} g (A) \equiv \frac {1}{2} \left\| \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {x} \sim \mathcal {D}} [ \boldsymbol {x} \boldsymbol {x} ^ {\top} ] - \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z} \sim \mathcal {N} (0, I _ {k \times k})} [ \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) ^ {\top} ] \right\| _ {F} ^ {2}, \text {a n d} \\ g _ {n} (A) \equiv \frac {1}{2} \left\| \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {\top} - \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z} \sim \mathcal {N} (0, I _ {k \times k})} \left[ \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) ^ {\top} \right] \right\| _ {F} ^ {2}. \\ \end{array}
$$

# Claim 2.

$$
\nabla g (A) - \nabla g _ {n} (A) = 2 \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z}} \left[ d i a g \left(\phi^ {\prime} (A \boldsymbol {z})\right) \left(X - X _ {n}\right) \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) \boldsymbol {z} ^ {\top} \right],
$$

where  $X = \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x} \sim \mathcal{D}}[\boldsymbol{x}\boldsymbol{x}^{\top}]$ , and  $X_{n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{\top}$ . The directional derivative with arbitrary direction  $B$  is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} D \nabla g (A) [ B ] - D \nabla g _ {n} (A) [ B ] = 2 \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z}} \left[ d i a g \left(\phi^ {\prime} (A \boldsymbol {z})\right) \left(X _ {n} - X\right) \phi^ {\prime} (A \boldsymbol {z}) \circ (B \boldsymbol {z}) \boldsymbol {z} ^ {\top} \right] \\ + 2 \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {z}} \left[ \operatorname {d i a g} \left(\phi^ {\prime \prime} (A \boldsymbol {z}) \circ (B \boldsymbol {z})\right) \left(X _ {n} - X\right) \phi (A \boldsymbol {z}) \boldsymbol {z} ^ {\top} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Lemma 3. Suppose the activation satisfies Assumption 3.  $\operatorname*{Pr}[\| X - X_n\| \leq \epsilon \| X\| ]\geq 1 - \delta$  , for  $n\geq \tilde{\Theta} (d / \epsilon^2\log^2 (1 / \delta))^2$

Lemma 4. Suppose the activation satisfies Assumption 2&3. With samples  $n \geq \tilde{\Theta}(d / \epsilon^2 \log^2(1 / \delta))$ ,  $\| \nabla g(A) - \nabla g_n(A) \|_2 \leq \mathcal{O}(\epsilon d \| A \|_2)$  with probability  $1 - \delta$ . Meanwhile,  $\| D\nabla g(A)[B] - D\nabla g_n(A)[B] \|_2 \leq \mathcal{O}(\epsilon d^{3/2} \| A \|_2 \| B \|_2)$  with probability  $1 - \delta$ .

# 5.2 BOUNDING MINI-BATCH SIZE

Normally for empirical risk for supervised learning, the mini-batch size can be arbitrarily small since the estimator of the gradient is unbiased. However in the WGAN setting, notice for each iteration, we randomly sample a batch of random variables  $\{\pmb{z}_i\}_{i\in [m]}$ , and obtain a gradient of  $\tilde{g}_{m,n}(A)\equiv \frac{1}{2}\left\| \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\pmb{x}_i\pmb{x}_i^\top -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j = 1}^{m}\phi (Az_j)\phi (Az_j)^\top \right\| _F^2$ , in Algorithm 1. However, the finite sum is inside the Frobenius norm and the gradient on each mini-batch may no longer be an unbiased estimator for our target  $g_{n}(A) = \frac{1}{2}\left\| \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\pmb{x}_i\pmb{x}_i^\top -\mathbb{E}_z\left[\phi (Az)\phi (Az)^\top \right]\right\| _F^2$

In other words, we conduct stochastic gradient descent over the function  $f(A) \equiv \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}} \tilde{g}_{m,n}(A)$ . Therefore we just need to analyze the gradient error between this  $f(A)$  and  $g_{n}(A)$  (i.e.  $\tilde{g}_{m,n}$  is almost an unbiased estimator of  $g_{n}$ ). Finally with the concentration bound derived in last section, we get the error bound between  $f(A)$  and  $g(A)$ .

Lemma 5. The empirical risk  $\tilde{g}_{m,n}$  is almost an unbiased estimator of  $g_{n}$ . Specifically, the expected function  $f(A) = \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{z}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_{k \times k}), i \in [m]} [\tilde{g}_{m,n}]$  satisfies:

$$
\| \nabla f (A) - \nabla g _ {n} (A) \| \leq \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {1}{m} \| A \| ^ {3} d ^ {2}\right).
$$

For arbitrary direction matrix  $B$ ,

$$
\| D \nabla f (A) [ B ] - D \nabla g _ {n} (A) [ B ] \| \leq \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {1}{m} \| B \| \| A \| ^ {3} d ^ {5 / 2}\right).
$$

In summary, we conduct concentration bound over the observation samples and mini-batch sizes, and show the gradient of  $f(A)$  that Algorithm 1 is optimizing over has close gradient and Hessian with the population risk  $g(A)$ . Therefore a second-order stationary point (SOSP) for  $f(A)$  (that our algorithm is guaranteed to achieve) is also an  $\epsilon$  approximated SOSP for  $g(A)$ . Next we show such a point also yield an  $\epsilon$  approximated first-order stationary point of the reparametrized function  $\tilde{g}(Z) \equiv g(A), \forall Z = AA^{\top}$ .

# 5.3 RELATIONON APPROXIMATE OPTIMALITY

In this section, we establish the relationship between  $\tilde{g}$  and  $g$ . We present the general form of our target Problem 1:

$$
\min  _ {A \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d \times k}} g (A) \equiv \tilde {g} \left(A A ^ {\top}\right) \tag {5}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {s . t .} \quad \operatorname {T r} (A ^ {\top} X _ {i} A) = y _ {i}, X _ {i} \in \mathbb {S}, y _ {i} \in \mathbb {R}, i = 1, \dots , n. \end{array}
$$

Similar to the previous section, the stationary property might not be obvious on the original problem. Instead, we could look at the re-parametrized version as:

$$
\min  _ {Z \in \mathbb {S}} \tilde {g} (Z) \tag {6}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {s . t .} \quad \operatorname {T r} (X _ {i} Z) = y _ {i}, X _ {i} \in \mathbb {S}, y _ {i} \in \mathbb {R}, i = 1, \dots , n, \end{array}
$$

$$
Z \succeq 0,
$$

Definition 1. A matrix  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$  is called an  $\epsilon$ -approximate second-order stationary point ( $\epsilon$ -SOSP) of Eqn. (5) if there exists a vector  $\lambda$  such that:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \operatorname {T r} (A ^ {\top} X _ {i} A) = y _ {i}, i \in [ n ] \\ \| (\nabla_ {Z} \tilde {g} (A A ^ {\top}) - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \lambda_ {i} X _ {i}) \tilde {\boldsymbol {a}} _ {j} \| \leq \epsilon \| \tilde {\boldsymbol {a}} _ {j} \|, & \{\tilde {\boldsymbol {a}} _ {j} \} _ {j} s p a n t h e c o l u m n s p a c e o f A \\ \operatorname {T r} (B ^ {\top} D \nabla_ {A} \mathcal {L} (A, \lambda) [ B ]) \geq - \epsilon \| B \| ^ {2}, & \forall B s. t.   \operatorname {T r} (B ^ {\top} X _ {i} A) = 0 \end{array} \right.
$$

Here  $\mathcal{L}(A,\lambda)$  is the Lagrangian form  $\tilde{g} (AA^{\top}) - \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\lambda_{i}(\mathrm{Tr}(A^{\top}X_{i}A) - y_{i})$

Specifically, when  $\epsilon = 0$  the above definition is exactly the second-order KKT condition for optimizing (5). Next we present the approximate first-order KKT condition for (6):

Definition 2. A symmetric matrix  $Z \in \mathbb{S}^n$  is an  $\epsilon$ -approximate first order stationary point of function (6) ( $\epsilon$ -FOSP) if and only if there exist a vector  $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}^m$  and a symmetric matrix  $S \in \mathbb{S}$  such that the following holds:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \operatorname {T r} (X _ {i} Z) = y _ {i}, i \in [ n ] \\ Z \succeq 0, \\ S \succeq - \epsilon I, \\ \| S \tilde {\boldsymbol {a}} _ {j} \| \leq \epsilon \| \tilde {\boldsymbol {a}} _ {j} \|, \\ S = \nabla_ {Z} \tilde {g} (Z) - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \sigma_ {i} X _ {i}. \end{array} \right. \{\tilde {\boldsymbol {a}} _ {j} \} _ {j} \text {s p a n t h e c o l u m n s p a c e o f Z}
$$

Lemma 6. Let latent dimension  $k = d$ . For an  $\epsilon$ -SOSP of function (5) with  $A$  and  $\lambda$ , it infers an  $\epsilon$ -FOSP of function (6) with  $Z, \sigma$  and  $S$  that satisfies:  $Z = AA^{\top}$ ,  $\sigma = \lambda$  and  $S = \nabla_Z\tilde{g} (AA^{\top}) - \sum_i\lambda_iX_i$ .

Now it remains to show an  $\epsilon$ -FOSP of  $\tilde{g}(Z)$  indeed yields a good approximation for the ground truth parameter matrix.

Lemma 7. If  $Z$  is an  $\epsilon$ -FOSP of function (6), then  $\| Z - Z^{*}\|_{F} \leq \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ . Here  $Z^{*} = A^{*}(A^{*})^{\top}$  is the optimal solution for function (6).

Together with the previous arguments, we finally achieve our main theorem on connecting the recovery guarantees with the sample complexity and batch size<sup>3</sup>:

Theorem 3. For arbitrary  $\delta < 1, \epsilon$ , given small enough learning rate  $\eta < 1/poly(d, 1/\epsilon, \log(1/\delta))$ , let sample size  $n \geq \tilde{\Theta}(d^5/\epsilon^2 \log^2(1/\delta))$ , batch size  $m \geq \mathcal{O}(d^5/\epsilon)$ , for large enough  $T = \text{poly}(1/\eta, 1/\epsilon, d, \log(1/\delta))$ , the output of Algorithm 1 satisfies  $\|A^{(T)}(A^{(T)})^\top - Z^*\|_F \leq \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$  with probability  $1 - \delta$ , under Assumptions 2 & 3 and  $k = d$ .

# 6 SIMULATIONS

In this section, we provide simple experimental results to validate the performance of stochastic gradient descent ascent and provide experimental support for our theory.

We focus on Algorithm 1 that targets to recover the parameter matrix. We conduct a thorough empirical studies on three joint factors that might affect the performance: the number of observed samples  $m$  (we set  $n = m$  as in general GAN training algorithms), the different choices of activation function  $\phi$ , and the output dimension  $d$ . In Figure 1 we plot the relative error for parameter estimation decrease over the increasing sample complexity. We fix the hidden dimension  $k = 2$ , and vary the output dimension over  $\{3,5,7\}$  and sample complexity over  $\{500,1000,2000,5000,10000\}$ . Reported values are averaged from 20 runs and we show the standard deviation with the corresponding colored shadow. Clearly the recovery error decreases with higher sample complexity and smaller output dimension.

(b) tanh activation  
Figure 2: Comparisons of different performance with leakyReLU and tanh activations. Same color starts from the same starting point. For both cases, parameters always converge to true covariance matrix. Each arrow indicates the progress of 500 iteration steps.

To visually demonstrate the learning process, we also include a simple comparison for different  $\phi$ : i.e. leaky ReLU and tanh activations, when  $k = 1$  and  $d = 2$ . We set the ground truth covariance matrix to be  $[1,1;1,1]$ , and therefore a valid result should be  $[1,1]$  or  $[-1,-1]$ . From Figure 2 we could see that for both leaky ReLU and tanh, the stochastic gradient descent ascent performs similarly with exact recovery of the ground truth parameters.

# 7 CONCLUSION

We analyze the convergence of stochastic gradient descent ascent for Wasserstein GAN on learning a single layer generator network. We show that stochastic gradient descent ascent algorithm attains the global min-max point, and provably recovers the parameters of the network with  $\epsilon$  absolute error measured in Frobenius norm, from  $\tilde{\Theta}(d^5/\epsilon^2)$  i.i.d samples.
