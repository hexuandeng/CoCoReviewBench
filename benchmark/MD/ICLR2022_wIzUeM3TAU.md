# ABSTRACT

Characterizing the separation power of graph neural networks (GNNs) provides an understanding of their limitations for graph learning tasks. Results regarding separation power are, however, usually geared at specific GNN architectures, and tools for understanding arbitrary GNN architectures are generally lacking. We provide an elegant way to easily obtain bounds on the separation power of GNNs in terms of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) tests, which have become the yardstick to measure the separation power of GNNs. The crux is to view GNNs as expressions in a procedural tensor language describing the computations in the layers of the GNNs. Then, by a simple analysis of the obtained expressions, in terms of the number of indexes and the nesting depth of summations, bounds on the separation power in terms of the WL-tests readily follow. Furthermore, the tensor language point of view allows for the derivation of universality results for classes of GNNs in a natural way. Our approach provides a toolbox with which GNN architecture designers can analyze the separation power of their GNNs, without needing to know the intricacies of the WL-tests. We also provide insights in what is needed to boost the separation power of GNNs.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Merkwirth & Lengauer, 2005; Scarselli et al., 2009) cover many popular deep learning methods for graph learning tasks (see Hamilton (2020) for a recent overview). These methods typically compute vector embeddings of vertices or graphs by relying on the underlying adjacency information. Invariance (for graph embeddings) and equivariance (for vertex embeddings) of GNNs ensure that these methods are oblivious to the precise representation of the graphs.

Separation power. The primary focus of this paper concerns the separation power of GNN architectures, that is, on their ability to separate vertices or graphs by means of the computed embeddings. In turn, characterizing the separation power of GNNs reveals insights into their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to graph learning tasks. It has become standard to characterize GNN architectures in terms of the separation power of classical graph algorithms such as color refinement (CR) and  $k$ -dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman tests ( $k$ -WL), as initiated in Xu et al. (2019) and Morris et al. (2019). Unfortunately, understanding the separation power of any given GNN architecture requires complex proofs that are geared at the specifics of such architecture. We do not have any general technique allowing us to expand these results for arbitrary GNNs.

Tensor languages. We study the separation power of vector embeddings that can be computed by general-purpose tensor languages. By focusing on this more general context, we obtain insights about specific GNN architectures by simply describing them in such a tensor language. A first advantage of using tensor languages is that only invariant and equivariant graph functions can be defined. As such, any GNN that can be cast in our tensor language inherits these desired properties. A second important advantage is that the separation power of tensor languages is as closely related to CR and  $k$ -WL as GNNs are. Loosely speaking, if tensor language expressions use  $k + 1$  indices, then their separation power is bounded by  $k$ -WL. Furthermore, if their summation depth (maximum nesting of summations) is  $t$ , then  $t$  rounds of  $k$ -WL are needed to obtain an upper bound on the separation power. A similar connection is obtained for CR and a fragment of tensor language that we call "guarded" tensor language.

We thus reduce problem of assessing the separation power of any specific GNN architecture to the problem of specifying it in our tensor language, analyzing the number of indices used and counting their summation depth. As we show in the paper, this is usually much easier than dealing with intricacies of CR and  $k$ -WL. In fact, casting GNNs in our tensor language is often as simple as writing down their layer-based definition found in research articles. We believe that this provides a nice toolbox for GNN designers to assess the separation power of their architecture.

We use this toolbox to recover known results about the separation power of specific GNN architectures such as GINs (Xu et al., 2019), GCNs (Kipf & Welling, 2017), Folklore GNNs (Maron et al., 2019b),  $k$ -GNNs (Morris et al., 2019), and several others. And we also derive new results: we answer an open problem posed by Maron et al. (2019a) by showing that the separation power of Invariant Graph Networks ( $k$ -IGNs), introduced by Maron et al. (2019b), is bounded by  $(k - 1)$ -WL. In all this, we make explicit how the number of layers connects to the number of rounds of the WL-tests.

When writing down GNNs in our tensor language, the less indices needed, the stronger the bounds in terms of  $k$ -WL we obtain. After all,  $(k - 1)$ -WL is known to be strictly less separating than  $k$ -WL (Otto, 2017). Thus, it is important to minimize the number of indices used in tensor language expressions. We connect this number to the notion of treewidth: expressions of treewidth  $k$  can be translated into expressions using  $k + 1$  indices. This corresponds to optimizing expressions, as done in many areas in machine learning, by reordering the summations (a.k.a. variable elimination).

Approximation and universality. Another important aspect of GNNs that has received considerable attention is their ability to approximate general invariant or equivariant graph functions. Once more, instead of focusing on specific architectures, we use our tensor languages to obtain general approximation results, which naturally translate to universality results for GNNs.

We show:  $k + 1$  index tensor language expressions suffice to approximate any (invariant/equivariant) graph function whose separating power is bounded by  $k$ -WL, and we can further refine this by comparing the number of rounds in  $k$ -WL with the summation depth of the expressions. These results provide a finer picture than the one obtained by Azizian & Lelarge (2021). Furthermore, focusing on "guarded" tensor expressions yields a similar universality result for CR, a result that, to our knowledge, was not known before. We also provide the link between approximation results for tensor expressions and GNNs, enabling us to transfer our insights into universality properties of GNNs. As an example, we show that  $k$ -IGNs can approximate any graph function that is less separating than  $(k - 1)$ -WL. This case was left open in Azizian & Lelarge (2021).

In summary, our paper draws new and interesting connections between tensor languages, GNN architectures and classic graph algorithms. These connections provide a general recipe to bound the separation power of GNNs, optimize them, and understand their approximation power. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method by recovering several results shown in recent years, as well as new results, some of them left open in previous work.

Related Work. Separation power has only been studied for specific classes of GNNs (Morris et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Maron et al., 2019b; Chen et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2020; Azizian & Lelarge, 2021) by relying on properties of CR and  $k$ -WL. Connections between  $k$ -WL, for  $k = 1, 2$ , and general matrix query languages are known (Brijder et al., 2019; Geerts, 2021; Geerts et al., 2021b), albeit not in the context of GNNs. We differ by analyzing the separation power of general tensor languages, from which known results on GNNs can be recovered. Regarding universality, the work by Azizian & Lelarge (2021) is closest in spirit. Our tensor language approach, however, provides an elegant way to recover and extend their results. Azizian & Lelarge (2021) describe how their work (and hence also ours) encompasses previous works (Keriven & Peyré, 2019; Maron et al., 2019c; Chen et al., 2019). Our results are based on connections between  $k$ -WL and logics (Immerman & Lander, 1990; Cai et al., 1992), and CR and guarded logics (Barceló et al., 2020). We refer to Grohe (2021) for a recent overview. The optimization of algebraic computations and the use of treewidth relates to the approaches by Aji & McEliece (2000) and Abo Khamis et al. (2016).

Outline. We cite additional related works throughout the paper and provide details in the supplementary material. After providing some background, we introduce our tensor languages in Section 3, followed by a full characterization of their separation power in Section 4. In Section 5 we emphasize important consequences of our results for understanding the power of various GNNs. Finally, we present general approximation results and consequences for GNNs in Section 6.

# 2 BACKGROUND

We denote sets by  $\{\}$  and multisets by  $\{\{\}\}$ . For  $n\in \mathbb{N}$ ,  $n > 0$ ,  $[n]\coloneqq \{1,\ldots ,n\}$ . Vectors are denoted by  $\pmb {v},\pmb {w},\dots$ , matrices by  $A,B,\dots$ , and tensors by  $\mathbf{S},\mathbf{T},\dots$ . Furthermore,  $v_{i}$  is the  $i$ -th entry of vector  $\pmb{v}$ ,  $A_{ij}$  is the  $(i,j)$ -th entry of matrix  $A$  and  $\mathbf{S}_i$  denotes the  $\pmb{i} = (i_1,\dots,i_k)$ -th entry of a tensor  $\mathbf{S}$ . If certain dimensions are unspecified, then this is denoted by a “:”. For example,  $A_{i}$ : and  $A_{j}$ : denote the  $i$ -th row and  $j$ -th column of matrix  $A$ , respectively. Similarly for slices of tensors.

An undirected simple graph  $G = (V_G, E_G, \mathsf{col}_G)$  is represented by a vertex set  $V_G$ , edge set  $E_G \subseteq V_G^2$ , which is symmetric and irreflexive, and vertex-labelling  $\mathsf{col}_G : V_G \to \{0,1\}^\ell$ . Throughout the paper we assume that graphs have size  $n$ , so  $V_G$  consists of  $n$  vertices and we often identify  $V_G$  with  $[n]$ . For a vertex  $v \in V_G$ ,  $N_G(v) := \{u \in V_G \mid vu \in E_G\}$ . We let  $\mathcal{G}$  be the set of all graphs of size  $n$  and let  $\mathcal{G}_s$  be the set of pairs  $(G, v)$  with  $G \in \mathcal{G}$  and  $v \in V_G^s$ . Note that  $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{G}_0$ .

The following vertex and graph-labelling algorithms will play an important role. The color refinement algorithm (CR) (Morgan, 1965) iteratively computes vertex labellings, as follows. For a graph  $G$  and vertex  $v \in V_G$ ,  $\mathsf{cr}^{(0)}(G,v) := \mathsf{col}_G(v)$ . Then, for  $t \geq 0$ ,  $\mathsf{cr}^{(t+1)}(G,v) := (\mathsf{cr}^{(t)}(G,v), \{\{\mathsf{cr}^{(t)}(G,u) \mid u \in N_G(v)\}\})$ . Furthermore, we define  $\mathsf{gcr}^{(t)}(G) := \{\{\mathsf{cr}^{(t)}(G,v) \mid v \in V_G\}\}$ . The  $k$ -dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm (k-WL) (Weisfeiler & Lehman, 1968; Cai et al., 1992) iteratively computes labellings of  $k$ -tuples of vertices. Initially, for a graph  $G$  and  $v \in V_G^k$ ,  $\mathsf{wI}_{k}^{(0)}(G,v) := \mathsf{atp}_{k}(G,v)$  where  $\mathsf{atp}_{k}(G,v) \in \{0,1\}^{2\binom{k}{2} + k\ell}$  is the atomic type vector which for  $1 \leq i < j \leq k$  has two entries indicating whether  $v_{i} = v_{j}$  and whether  $v_{i}v_{j} \in E_{G}$ , and for  $1 \leq i \leq k$  has  $\ell$  entries corresponding to  $\mathsf{col}_G(v_i)$ . For  $t \geq 0$ ,  $\mathsf{wI}_{k}^{(t+1)}(G,v) := (\mathsf{wI}_{k}^{(t)}(G,v), M)$  with  $M := \{\{\mathsf{atp}_{k+1}(G,vu), \mathsf{wI}_{k}^{(t)}(G,v[u/1]), \ldots, \mathsf{wI}_{k}^{(t)}(G,v[u/k])\} \mid u \in V_G\}$ , where  $v[u/i] := (v_1, \ldots, v_{i-1}, u, v_{i+1}, \ldots, v_k)$ . We use  $k$ -WL for vertex-labellings by defining  $\mathsf{wI}_{k}^{(t)}(G,v) := \mathsf{wI}_{k}^{(t)}(G,(v,\ldots,v))$  and for graph-labellings we define  $\mathsf{gWl}_{k}^{(t)} := \{\{\mathsf{wI}_{k}^{(t)}(G,v) \mid v \in V_{G}^{k}\} \}$ . Note that 1-WL differs from CR in that 1-WL also uses information from non-adjacent vertices (Grohe, 2021). Moreover, we use  $\mathsf{cr}^{(\infty)}, \mathsf{gcr}^{(\infty)}, \mathsf{wI}_{k}^{(\infty)},$  and  $\mathsf{gWl}_{k}^{(\infty)}$  to denote the stable labellings produced by the corresponding algorithm over an arbitrary number of rounds.

Let  $G$  be a graph with  $V_{G} = [n]$  and let  $\sigma$  be a permutation of  $[n]$ . We denote by  $\sigma \star G$  the isomorphic copy of  $G$  obtained by applying the permutation  $\sigma$ . Similarly, for  $\boldsymbol{v} \in V_{G}^{k}$ ,  $\sigma \star \boldsymbol{v}$  is the permuted version of  $\boldsymbol{v}$ . Let  $\mathbb{F}$  be some feature space. A function  $f: \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathbb{F}$  is called invariant if  $f(G) = f(\sigma \star G)$  for any permutation  $\pi$ . More generally,  $f: \mathcal{G}_s \to \mathbb{F}$  is equivariant if  $f(\sigma \star G, \sigma \star \boldsymbol{v}) = f(G, \boldsymbol{v})$  for any permutation  $\sigma$ . The functions  $\mathrm{cr}^{(t)}: \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathbb{F}$  and  $\mathrm{vw}|_k^{(t)}: \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathbb{F}$  are equivariant, whereas  $\mathrm{gcr}^{(t)}: \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathbb{F}$  and  $\mathrm{gw}|_k^{(t)}: \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathbb{F}$  are invariant, for any  $t \geq 0$  and  $k \geq 1$ .

# 3 SPECIFYING GNNS

Many GNN architectures are described in terms of linear algebra computations on vectors, matrices or tensors, interleaved with the application of activation functions or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We aim at understanding the separation power of GNNs, without being tied to a specific GNN architecture. In order to do so, in this section, we introduce a specification language in which many GNN architectures can be represented. We dub this language, TL, for tensor language. The idea of this language is to express algebraic computations in a more procedural way by specifying algebraic operations over tensors by explicitly stating how each entry is to be computed.

As an example, consider a typical layer in a GNN of the form  $\pmb{F}^{\prime} = \sigma (\pmb {A}\cdot \pmb {F}\cdot \pmb {W})$ , where  $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$  is an adjacency matrix,  $\pmb {F}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times \ell}$  are vertex features such that  $F_{i:}\in \mathbb{R}^{\ell}$  is the feature vector of vertex  $i$ ,  $\sigma$  is a non-linear activation function, and  $W\in \mathbb{R}^{\ell \times \ell}$  is a weight matrix. By exposing the indices in the matrices and vectors we can equivalently write: for  $i\in [n]$  and  $s\in [\ell ]$ :

$$
F _ {i s} ^ {\prime} := \sigma \Big (\sum_ {j \in [ n ]} A _ {i j} \cdot \big (\sum_ {t \in [ \ell ]} W _ {t s} \cdot F _ {j t} \big) \Big).
$$

In TL, we do not work with specific matrices or indices ranging over  $[n]$ , but focus instead on expressions applicable to any matrix. We use index variables  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  instead of  $i$  and  $j$ , replace  $A_{ij}$  with a placeholder  $E(x_{1},x_{2})$  and  $F_{jt}$  with placeholders  $P_{t}(x_{2})$ , for  $t\in [\ell ]$ . We then represent the above computation in TL by  $\ell$  expressions  $\psi_s(x_1)$ , one for each feature column, as follows:

$$
\psi_ {s} (x _ {1}) = \sigma \Big (\sum_ {x _ {2}} E (x _ {1}, x _ {2}) \cdot \big (\sum_ {t \in [ \ell ]} W _ {t s} \cdot P _ {t} (x _ {2}) \big) \Big).
$$

These are pure syntactical expressions. To give them a semantics, we assign to  $E$  a matrix  $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ , to  $P_{t}$  column vectors  $\mathbf{F}_{:t} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$ , for  $t \in [\ell]$ , and to  $x_{1}$  an index  $i \in [n]$ . By letting the variable  $x_{2}$  under the summation range over  $1, 2, \ldots, n$ , the TL expression  $\psi_{s}(i)$  evaluates to  $F_{is}'$ . As such,  $\mathbf{F}' = \sigma(\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{W})$  can be represented as a specific instance of the above TL expressions. Throughout the paper we reason about expressions in TL rather than specific instances thereof. Importantly, by showing that certain properties hold for expressions in TL, these properties are inherited by all of its instances. We use TL to enable a theoretical analysis of the separating power of GNNs; It is not intended as a practical programming language for GNNs. The language TL is inspired by recent work on matrix query languages (Brijder et al., 2019; Geerts, 2021; Geerts et al., 2021b).

Syntax. We first give the complete syntax of TL expressions. We have a binary predicate  $E$ , to represent adjacency matrices, and unary vertex predicates  $P_{s}$ ,  $s \in S$ , to represent vectors, hot-one encoding vertex labels. In addition, we have a (possibly infinite) set  $\Omega$  of (non-linear) functions, such as activation functions or MLPs. Then,  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$  expressions are defined by the following grammar:

$$
\varphi := \mathbf {1} _ {x \text {o p} y} \mid E (x, y) \mid P _ {s} (x) \mid \varphi \cdot \varphi \mid \varphi + \varphi \mid a \cdot \varphi \mid f (\varphi , \dots , \varphi) \mid \sum_ {x} \varphi
$$

where  $\mathsf{op}\in \{= ,\neq \}$ $x,y$  are index variables that specify entries in tensors,  $s\in S$ $a\in \mathbb{R}$  , and  $f\in \Omega$  . We sometimes make explicit which functions are used in expressions in  $\mathsf{T L}(\Omega)$  by writing  $\mathsf{T L}(f_1,f_2,\ldots)$  for  $f_{1},f_{2},\ldots$  in  $\Omega$  . For example, the expressions  $\psi_s(x_1)$  are in  $\mathsf{T L}(\sigma)$

The set of free index variables of an expression  $\varphi$ , denoted by  $\mathrm{free}(\varphi)$ , determines the order of the tensor represented by  $\varphi$ . It is defined inductively:  $\mathrm{free}(\mathbf{1}_{x \circ p} y) = \mathrm{free}(E(x, y)) := \{x, y\}$ ,  $\mathrm{free}(P_s(x)) = \{x\}$ ,  $\mathrm{free}(\varphi_1 \cdot \varphi_2) = \mathrm{free}(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2) := \mathrm{free}(\varphi_1) \cup \mathrm{free}(\varphi_2)$ ,  $\mathrm{free}(a \cdot \varphi_1) := \mathrm{free}(\varphi_1)$ ,  $\mathrm{free}(f(\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_p)) := \cup_{i \in [p]} \mathrm{free}(\varphi_i)$ , and  $\mathrm{free}(\sum_x \varphi_1) := \mathrm{free}(\varphi_1) \setminus \{x\}$ . We sometimes explicitly write the free indices. In our example expressions  $\psi_s(x_1)$ ,  $x_1$  is the free index variable.

An important class of expressions are those that only use index variables  $\{x_{1},\ldots ,x_{k}\}$ . We denote by  $\mathsf{T L}_k(\Omega)$  the  $k$ -index variable fragment of  $\mathsf{T L}(\Omega)$ . The expressions  $\psi_s(x_1)$  are in  $\mathsf{T L}_2(\sigma)$ .

Semantics. We next define the semantics of expressions in  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$ . Let  $G = (V_G, E_G, \mathrm{col}_G)$  be a vertex-labelled graph. We start by defining the interpretation  $\pi_G[[\cdot, \nu]]$  of the predicates  $E$ ,  $P_s$  and the (dis)equality predicates, relative to  $G$  and a valuation  $\nu$  assigning a vertex to each index variable:

$$
\pi_ {G} \llbracket E (x, y), \nu \rrbracket := \text {i f} \nu (x) \nu (y) \in E _ {G} \text {t h e n 1 e l s e 0}
$$

$$
\pi_ {G} \llbracket P _ {s} (x), \nu \rrbracket := \operatorname {c o l} _ {G} (\nu (x)) _ {s}
$$

$$
\pi_ {G} \llbracket \mathbf {1} _ {x \mathrm {o p} y}, \nu \rrbracket := \text {i f} \nu (x) \mathrm {o p} \nu (y) \text {t h e n 1 e l s e 0}.
$$

In other words,  $E$  is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of  $G$  and the  $P_{s}$ 's interpret the vertex-labelling  $\mathrm{col}_G$ . Furthermore, we lift interpretations to arbitrary expressions in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}(\Omega)$ , as follows:

$$
\pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {1} \cdot \varphi_ {2}, \nu \rrbracket := \pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {1}, \nu \rrbracket \cdot \pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {2}, \nu \rrbracket \quad \pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {1} + \varphi_ {2}, \nu \rrbracket := \pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {1}, \nu \rrbracket + \pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {2}, \nu \rrbracket
$$

$$
\pi_ {G} \llbracket \sum_ {x} \varphi_ {1}, \nu \rrbracket := \sum_ {v \in V _ {G}} \pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {1}, \nu [ x \mapsto v ] \rrbracket \quad \pi_ {G} \llbracket a \cdot \varphi_ {1}, \nu \rrbracket := a \cdot \pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {1}, \nu \rrbracket
$$

$$
\pi_ {G} \llbracket f (\varphi_ {1}, \dots , \varphi_ {p}), \nu \rrbracket := f (\pi_ {\tilde {G}} \llbracket \varphi_ {1}, \nu \rrbracket , \dots , \pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {p}, \nu \rrbracket)
$$

where,  $\nu[x \mapsto v]$  is the valuation  $\nu$  but which now maps the index  $x$  to the vertex  $v \in V_G$ . For simplicity, we identify valuations with their images. For example,  $\pi_G[[\varphi(x), v]]$  denotes  $\pi_G[[\varphi_1(x), x \mapsto v]]$ . To illustrate the semantics, for each  $v \in V_G$ ,  $\pi_G[[\psi_s, v]] = F_{vs}'$  for  $\pmb{F}' = \sigma(\pmb{A} \cdot \pmb{F} \cdot \pmb{W})$  when  $\pmb{A}$  is the adjacency matrix of  $G$  and  $\pmb{F}$  hot-one encodes the vertex labels.

Representing GNNs. Consider a function  $f: \mathcal{G}_s \to \mathbb{R}^\ell: (G, \mathbf{v}) \mapsto f(G, \mathbf{v}) \in \mathbb{R}^\ell$  for some  $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$ . We say that the function  $f$  can be represented in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}(\Omega)$ , if there exists  $\ell$  expressions  $\varphi_1(x_1, \ldots, x_s), \ldots, \varphi_\ell(x_1, \ldots, x_s)$  in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}(\Omega)$  such that for each graph  $G$  and each  $s$ -tuple  $\mathbf{v} \in V_G^s$ :

$$
f (G, \boldsymbol {v}) = \left(\pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {1}, \boldsymbol {v} \rrbracket , \dots , \pi_ {G} \llbracket \varphi_ {\ell}, \boldsymbol {v} \rrbracket\right).
$$

When  $f$  is described in terms of a GNN, we say that the GNN can be represented in  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$ . For example, we can interpret  $\pmb{F}' = \sigma(\pmb{A} \cdot \pmb{F} \cdot \pmb{W})$  as a function  $f: \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ , such that  $f(G, v) := \pmb{F}_{v'}'$ . We have seen that for each  $s \in [\ell]$ ,  $\pi_G[[\psi_s, v]] = F_{vs}'$ . Hence,  $f(G, v) = (\pi_G[[\psi_1, v]], \dots, \pi_G[[\psi_\ell, v]])$  and thus  $f$  (that is,  $\pmb{F}' = \sigma(\pmb{A} \cdot \pmb{F} \cdot \pmb{W})$ ) can be represented in  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$ . Most functions corresponding to GNNs can be represented in  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$ , as will be illustrated later in the paper.

TL represents equivariant or invariant functions. We make a simple observation which follows from the type of operators allowed in expressions in  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$ .

Proposition 3.1. Any function  $f: \mathcal{G}_s \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$  that can be represented in  $\mathrm{TL}(\Omega)$  is equivariant (or invariant if  $s = 0$ ).

An immediate consequence is that when a GNN can be represented in  $\mathrm{TL}(\Omega)$  it is automatically invariant or equivariant, depending on whether graph or vertex tuple embeddings are considered.

# 4 SEPARATION POWER OF TENSOR LANGUAGES

Our first main results concern the characterization of the separation power of tensor languages in terms of the color refinement and  $k$ -dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms. We provide a fine-grained characterization by taking the number of rounds of these algorithms into account. This will allow for measuring the separation power of classes of GNNs in terms of their number of layers.

# 4.1 SEPARATION POWER

We define the separation power of graph functions in terms of an equivalence relation, based on the definition from Azizian & Lelarge (2021), hereby first focusing on their ability to separate vertices.

Definition 1. Let  $\mathcal{F}$  be a set of functions  $f:\mathcal{G}_1\to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_f}$ . The equivalence relation  $\rho_{1}(\mathcal{F})$  is defined by  $\mathcal{F}$  on  $\mathcal{G}_1$  as follows: For any  $(G,v)$  and  $(H,w)$  in  $\mathcal{G}_1$ :

$$
\big ((G, v), (H, w) \big) \in \rho_ {1} (\mathcal {F}) \Longleftrightarrow \forall f \in \mathcal {F}, f (G, v) = f (H, w).
$$

In other words, when  $((G,v),(H,w))\in \rho_1(\mathcal{F})$ , no function in  $\mathcal{F}$  can separate  $v$  in  $G$  from  $w$  in  $H$ . For example, we can view  $\mathsf{cr}^{(t)}$  and  $\mathsf{vwl}_k^{(t)}$  as functions from  $\mathcal{G}_1$  to some  $\mathbb{R}^{\ell}$ . As such  $\rho_{1}(\mathsf{cr}^{(t)})$  and  $\rho_{1}(\mathsf{vwl}_{k}^{(t)})$  measure the separation power of these algorithms. The following strict inclusions are known: for all  $k\geq 1$ ,  $\rho_{1}(\mathsf{vwl}_{k + 1}^{(t)})\subset \rho_{1}(\mathsf{vwl}_{k}^{(t)})$  and  $\rho_{1}(\mathsf{vwl}_{1}^{(t)})\subset \rho_{1}(\mathsf{cr}^{(t)})$  (Otto, 2017; Grohe, 2021). It is also known that more rounds  $(t)$  increase the separation power of these algorithms (Fürer, 2001).

For a fragment  $\mathcal{L}$  of  $\mathrm{TL}(\Omega)$  expressions, we define  $\rho_{1}(\mathcal{L})$  as the equivalence relation associated with all functions  $f:\mathcal{G}_1\to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_f}$  that can be represented in  $\mathcal{L}$ . By definition, we here thus consider expressions in  $\mathrm{TL}(\Omega)$  with one free index variable resulting in vertex embeddings.

# 4.2 MAIN RESULTS

We first provide a link between  $k$ -WL and tensor language expressions using  $k + 1$  index variables:

Theorem 4.1. For each  $k \geq 1$  and any collection  $\Omega$  of functions,  $\rho_1\big(\mathsf{wcl}_k^{(\infty)}\big) = \rho_1\big(\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_{k + 1}(\Omega)\big)$ .

This theorem already gives us new insights: if we wish to understand how a new GNN architecture compares against the  $k$ -WL algorithms, all we need to do is to show that such an architecture can be represented in  $\mathsf{TL}_{k+1}(\Omega)$ , an arguably much easier endeavor. However, we can do much more. We next present finer separation results that relate the rounds of  $k$ -WL to the notion of summation depth of  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$  expressions, and we present similar results for functions computing graph embeddings.

The summation depth  $\mathsf{sd}(\varphi)$  of a  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$  expression  $\varphi$  measures the nesting depth of the summations  $\sum_{x}$  in the expression. It is defined inductively:  $\mathsf{sd}(\mathbf{1}_{x\mathrm{op}y}) = \mathsf{sd}(E(x,y)) = \mathsf{sd}(P_s(x))\coloneqq 0,$ $\mathsf{sd}(\varphi_1\cdot \varphi_2) = \mathsf{sd}(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2)\coloneqq \max \{\mathsf{sd}(\varphi_1),\mathsf{sd}(\varphi_2)\}$ $\mathsf{sd}(a\cdot \varphi_1)\coloneqq \mathsf{sd}(\varphi_1)$ $\mathsf{sd}(f(\varphi_1,\ldots ,\varphi_p))\coloneqq$ $\max \{\mathsf{sd}(\varphi_i)|i\in [p]\}$  , and  $\mathsf{sd}(\sum_x\varphi_1)\coloneqq \mathsf{sd}(\varphi_1) + 1$  . As an example, our expressions  $\psi_{s}(x_{1})$  from before have a summation depth of one. We write  $\mathsf{T L}_k^{(t)}(\Omega)$  for the class of expressions in  $\mathsf{T L}_k(\Omega)$  of summation depth at most  $t$

We can now refine Theorem 4.1, taking into account the number of rounds used in  $k$ -WL.

Theorem 4.2. For all  $t\geq 0$ $k\geq 1$  and any collection  $\Omega$  of functions,  $\rho_{1}\left(\mathsf{wcl}_{k}^{(t)}\right) = \rho_{1}\left(\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_{k + 1}^{(t)}(\Omega)\right)$ .

Proof. We use connections between the separation power of  $k$ -WL and the separation power of  $C_{k+1}$ , the  $(k+1)$ -variable fragment of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, as shown in the seminal works by Immerman & Lander (1990) and Cai et al. (1992). To make the connection between these logics and tensor languages, we translate expressions in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_{k+1}(\Omega)$  into logical formulae in the infinitary counterpart of  $C_{k+1}$ , which extends  $C_{k+1}$  with uncountably many disjunctions and conjunctions. This allows us to express any function application or arithmetic computation. Finally, we argue that the separation power of these infinitary versions coincides with the power of their standard counterparts. We thus obtain that  $C_{k+1}$  is more separating than  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_{k+1}(\Omega)$ , hereby providing the desired link to  $k$ -WL. Furthermore, we provide expressions in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_{k+1}$  that simulate formulae in  $C_{k+1}$ , hereby establishing that  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_{k+1}(\Omega)$  is also more separating than  $k$ -WL, for any  $\Omega$ .

Guarded TL and color refinement. As noted by Barceló et al. (2020), the separation power of vertex embeddings of simple GNNs, which propagate information only through neighboring vertices, is usually weaker than that of 1-WL. For these types of architectures, Barceló et al. (2020) provide a relation with the weaker color refinement algorithm, but only in the special case of first-order classifiers. We can recover and extend this result in our general setting, with a guarded version of TL which, as we will show, has the same separation power as color refinement.

The guarded fragment  $\mathrm{GTL}(\Omega)$  of  $\mathrm{T}\mathsf{L}_2(\Omega)$  is inspired by how adjacency matrices are used in common GNN architectures. In this fragment only equality predicates  $\mathbf{1}_{x_i = x_i}$  (constant 1) and  $\mathbf{1}_{x_i\neq x_i}$  (constant 0) are allowed, addition and multiplication require the component expressions to have the same (single) free index, and summation must occur in a guarded form  $\sum_{x_j}\left(E(x_i,x_j)\cdot \varphi (x_j)\right)$ , for  $i,j\in [2]$ . Intuitively, guardedness means that summation only happens over neighbors. In this fragment, all expressions have a single free variable and thus only functions from  $\mathcal{G}_1$  can be represented. Our example expressions  $\psi_s(x_1)$  are guarded. The fragment  $\mathrm{GTL}^{(t)}(\Omega)$  consists of expressions in  $\mathrm{GTL}(\Omega)$  of summation depth at most  $t$ , just as before.

Theorem 4.3. For all  $t \geq 0$  and any collection  $\Omega$  of functions:  $\rho_1\big(\mathsf{cr}^{(t)}\big) = \rho_1\big(\mathsf{GTL}^{(t)}(\Omega)\big)$ .

We recall that  $\rho_{1}(\mathsf{vw}_{1}^{(t)})\subset \rho_{1}(\mathsf{cr}^{(t)})$  which, combined with the previous two theorems, implies that  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_2^{(t)}(\Omega)$  is strictly more separating than  $\mathsf{GTL}^{(t)}(\Omega)$ .

Graph embeddings. We next establish connections between the graph versions of  $k$ -WL and CR, and TL expressions without free index variables. To this aim, we use  $\rho_0(\mathcal{F})$ , for a set  $\mathcal{F}$  of functions  $f: \mathcal{G} \to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_f}$ , as the equivalence relation over  $\mathcal{G}$  defined in analogy to  $\rho_1$ :

$$
(G, H) \in \rho_ {0} (\mathcal {F}) \Longleftrightarrow \forall f \in \mathcal {F}, f (G) = f (H).
$$

We thus consider separation power on the graph level. For example, we can consider  $\rho_0(\mathsf{gcr}^{(t)})$  and  $\rho_0(\mathsf{gwr}_k^{(t)})$  for any  $t\geq 0$  and  $k\geq 1$ . Also here,  $\rho_0(\mathsf{gwr}_{k + 1}^{(t)})\subset \rho_0(\mathsf{gwr}_k^{(t)})$  but different from vertex embeddings,  $\rho_0(\mathsf{gcr}^{(t)}) = \rho_0(\mathsf{gwr}_1^{(t)})$  (Grohe, 2021). We define  $\rho_0(\mathcal{L})$  for a fragment  $\mathcal{L}$  of  $\mathrm{TL}(\Omega)$  by considering expressions without free index variables resulting in graph embeddings.

Also here, the connection between the number of index variables in expressions and  $k$ -WL holds. Apart from  $k = 1$ , no clean relationship exists between summation depth and rounds, however.2

Theorem 4.4. For all  $t \geq 0$ ,  $k \geq 1$  and any collection  $\Omega$  of functions, we have that:

$$
(1) \rho_ {0} \big (\mathsf {g c r} ^ {(t)} \big) = \rho_ {0} \big (\mathsf {T L} _ {2} ^ {(t + 1)} (\Omega) \big) = \rho_ {0} \big (\mathsf {g w l} _ {1} ^ {(t)} \big) (2) \rho_ {0} \big (\mathsf {g w l} _ {k} ^ {(\infty)} \big) = \rho_ {0} \big (\mathsf {T L} _ {k + 1} (\Omega) \big).
$$

Intuitively, in (1) the increase in summation depth by one is incurred by the additional aggregation needed to collect all vertex labels computed by  $\mathsf{gw}_{1}^{(t)}$ .

Optimality of number of indices. Our results so far tell that graph functions represented in  $\mathsf{TL}_{k + 1}(\Omega)$  are at most as separating as  $k$ -WL. What is left unaddressed is whether all  $k + 1$  index variables are needed for the graph functions under consideration. It may well be, for example, that there exists an equivalent expression using less index variables. This would imply a stronger upper bound on the separation power by  $\ell$ -WL for  $\ell < k$ . We next identify a large class of  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$  expressions, those of treewidth  $k$ , for which the number of index variables can be reduced to  $k + 1$ .

Proposition 4.5. Expressions in  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$  of treewidth  $k$  are equivalent to expressions in  $\mathsf{TL}_{k + 1}(\Omega)$ .

Treewidth is defined in the supplementary material. Intuitively, treewidth  $k$  implies that the computation of tensor language expressions can be decomposed, by reordering summations, such that each local computation requires at most  $k + 1$  indices. This is similar to the generalized distributive law approach for optimizing computations by Aji & McEliece (2000) (see also Abo Khamis et al. (2016) for a more recent account). As a simple example, consider  $\theta(x_1) = \sum_{x_2} \sum_{x_3} E(x_1, x_2) \cdot E(x_2, x_3)$  in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_3^{(2)}$  such that  $\pi_G[[\theta, v]]$  counts the number of paths of length two starting from  $v$ . This expression has a treewidth of one. And indeed, it is equivalent to the expression  $\tilde{\theta}(x_1) = \sum_{x_2} E(x_1, x_2) \cdot \left( \sum_{x_1} E(x_2, x_1) \right)$  in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_2^{(2)}$  (and in fact in  $\mathsf{GTL}^{(2)}$ ). As a consequence, no more vertices can be separated by  $\theta(x_1)$  than by  $\mathsf{cr}^{(2)}$ , rather than  $\mathsf{vw}_2^2$  as the original expression in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_3^{(2)}$  suggests.

# 5 CONSEQUENCES FOR GNNS

We next interpret the general results on the separation power from Section 4 in the context of GNNs.

# 1. The separation power of any GNN vertex embedding architecture that can be represented in  $\mathsf{GTL}^{(t)}(\Omega)$  is bounded by the power of  $t$  rounds of color refinement.

As example, we consider the Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs) (Xu et al., 2019). A  $\mathsf{gin} \in \mathsf{GIN}$  operates as follows. Initially, let  $\ell_0 = \ell$  be the number of distinct vertex labels. Then,  $\mathsf{gin}^{(0)}: \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_0}: (G, v) \mapsto F_{v}^{(0)} := \mathsf{col}_G(v) \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell_0}$ . For layer  $t > 0$ ,  $\mathsf{gin}^{(t)}: \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_t}$  is given by:

$$
(G, v) \mapsto \boldsymbol {F} _ {v:} ^ {(t)} := \mathsf {m l p} ^ {(t)} \big (\boldsymbol {F} _ {v:} ^ {(t - 1)}, \sum_ {u \in N _ {G} (v)} \boldsymbol {F} _ {u:} ^ {(t - 1)} \big),
$$

with  $\pmb{F}^{(t)}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times \ell_t}$  and  $\mathsf{mlp}^{(t)} = (\mathsf{mlp}_1^{(t)},\dots,\mathsf{mlp}_{\ell_t}^{(t)}):\mathbb{R}^{2\ell_{t - 1}}\to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_t}$  is an MLP. We denote by  $\mathtt{GIN}^{(t)}$  the class of GINs consisting  $t$  layers. Clearly,  $\mathtt{gin}^{(0)}$  can be represented in  $\mathtt{GTL}^{(0)}$  by defining for each  $s\in [\ell_0]$ ,  $\varphi_s^{(0)}(x_1)\coloneqq P_s(x_1)$ . Assume that we have  $\ell_{t - 1}$  expressions  $\varphi_i^{(t - 1)}(x_1)$  in  $\mathtt{GTL}^{(t - 1)}(\Omega)$  representing  $\mathtt{gin}^{(t - 1)}$ . Then  $\mathtt{gin}^{(t)}$  is represented by  $\ell_t$  expressions  $\varphi_s^{(t)}(x_1)$  defined as:

$$
\mathsf {m l p} _ {s} ^ {(t)} \Big (\varphi_ {1} ^ {(t - 1)} (x _ {1}), \ldots , \varphi_ {\ell_ {t - 1}} ^ {(t - 1)} (x _ {1}), \sum_ {x _ {2}} E (x _ {1}, x _ {2}) \cdot \varphi_ {1} ^ {(t - 1)} (x _ {2}), \ldots , \sum_ {x _ {2}} E (x _ {1}, x _ {2}) \cdot \varphi_ {\ell_ {t - 1}} ^ {(t - 1)} (x _ {2}) \Big),
$$

which are now expressions in  $\mathrm{GTL}^{(t)}(\Omega)$  where  $\Omega$  consists of MLPs. As a consequence, Theorem 4.3 tells that  $t$ -layered GINs cannot be more separating than  $t$  rounds of color refinement, in accordance with known results (Xu et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2019). We thus simply cast GINs in  $\mathrm{GTL}(\Omega)$  to obtain an upper bound on their separation power. In the supplementary material we provide a similar analysis for "basic" GNNs (Hamilton et al., 2017), for GCNs (Kipf & Welling, 2017), resulting in an upper bound by  $t + 1$  color refinement rounds, and simplified GCNs (SGCs) (Wu et al., 2019).

# 2. The separation power of any GNN vertex embedding architecture that can be represented in  $\mathsf{TL}_{k + 1}^{(t)}(\Omega)$  is bounded by the power of  $t$  rounds of  $k$ -WL.

As example, for  $k = 1$ , we consider extended Graph Isomorphism Networks (eGINs) (Barceló et al., 2020). For an  $\mathrm{egin} \in \mathrm{eGIN}$ ,  $\mathrm{egin}^{(0)}: \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_0}$  is defined as for GINs, but for layer  $t > 0$ ,  $\mathrm{egin}^{(t)}: \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_t}$  is defined by

$$
(G, v) \mapsto \boldsymbol {F} _ {v:} ^ {(t)} := \mathfrak {m} | \mathfrak {p} ^ {(t)} \big (\boldsymbol {F} _ {v:} ^ {(t - 1)}, \sum_ {u \in N _ {G} (v)} \boldsymbol {F} _ {u:} ^ {(t - 1)}, \sum_ {u \in V _ {G}} \boldsymbol {F} _ {u:} ^ {(t - 1)} \big),
$$

where  $\mathsf{mlp}^{(t)}$  is now an MLP from  $\mathbb{R}^{3\ell_{t-1}} \to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_t}$ . We cannot represent such a layer in  $\mathrm{GTL}(\Omega)$  due to the presence of  $\sum_{u \in V_G} F_{u:}^{(t-1)}$  which corresponds to  $\sum_{x_1} \varphi^{(t-1)}(x_1)$  in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}(\Omega)$ . However, in a similar way as for GINs, we can represent these layers in  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_2^{(t)}(\Omega)$ . Theorem 4.2 tells that  $t$  rounds of 1-WL bound the separation power of  $t$ -layered extended GINs, conform to Barceló et al. (2020).

For  $k \geq 2$ , it is straightforward to show that  $t$ -layered "folklore" GNNs ( $k$ -FGNNs) (Maron et al., 2019b) can be represented in  $\mathsf{TL}_{k+1}^{(t)}(\Omega)$  and thus, by Theorem 4.2,  $t$  rounds of  $k$ -WL bound their separation power. Indeed, it merely requires to cast the layer definitions in  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$  and observe that  $k + 1$  indices and summation depth  $t$  are needed. This implies the result by Azizian & Lelarge (2021) showing that  $k$ -WL bounds the power of  $k$ -FGNNs, when the number of rounds and layers are unbounded. As another example, we show that the separation power of  $(k + 1)$ -Invariant Graph Networks (( $k + 1$ )-IGNs) (Maron et al., 2019b) are also bounded by  $k$ -WL, albeit with an increase in the required rounds. More specifically, we show the following.

Theorem 5.1. For any  $k \geq 1$ , the separation power of a t-layered  $(k + 1)$ -IGNs is bounded by the separation power of  $\text{tk}$  rounds of  $k$ -WL.

We hereby answer an open problem (Problem 1) posed in Maron et al. (2019a). The case  $k = 1$  was solved in Chen et al. (2020) by analyzing properties of 1-WL. By contrast, Theorem 4.2 shows that one can focus on expressing  $(k + 1)$ -IGNs in  $\mathsf{TL}_{k + 1}(\Omega)$  and analyzing the summation depth of expressions. The proof of Theorem 5.1 requires non-trivial manipulations of tensor language expressions; it is a simplified proof of (anonymous). The additional rounds  $(tk)$  are needed because  $(k + 1)$ -IGNs aggregate information in one layer that becomes accessible to  $k$ -WL in  $k$  rounds. We provide all details in the supplementary material, where we also identify a simple class of  $t$ -layered  $(k + 1)$ -IGNs that are as powerful as  $(k + 1)$ -IGNs but whose separation power is bounded by  $t$  rounds of  $k$ -WL. In the supplementary material, we discuss how the separation power of other GNN extensions can be obtained using our approach, such as, for example, simplicial GNNs (Bodnar et al., 2021).

3. The separation power of any GNN graph embedding architecture that can be represented in  $\mathsf{TL}_{k + 1}(\Omega)$  is bounded by the power of  $k$ -WL.

Graph embedding methods are commonly obtained from vertex (tuple) embeddings methods by including a readout layer in which all vertex (tuple) embeddings are aggregated. For example,  $\mathsf{mlp}(\sum_{v\in V}\mathsf{egin}^{(t)}(G,v))$  is a typical readout layer for eGINs. Since  $\mathsf{egin}^{(t)}$  can be represented in  $\mathsf{T L}_2^{(t)}(\Omega)$ , the readout layer can be represented in  $\mathsf{T L}_2^{(t + 1)}(\Omega)$ , using an extra summation. Hence, their separation power is bounded by  $\mathsf{gw}_{1}^{(t)}$ , in accordance with Theorem 4.4. This holds more generally. If a vertex (tuple) embedding method can be represented in  $\mathsf{T L}_{k + 1}(\Omega)$ , then the same holds for their graph versions, which are then bounded by  $\mathsf{gw}_{k}^{(\infty)}$  by our Theorem 4.4.

4. To go beyond the separation power of  $k$ -WL, it is necessary to use GNNs whose layers are represented by expressions of treewidth  $> k$ .

In particular, this means that to increase the separation power of a GNN it does not suffice to increase the number of layers: one needs to increase them in a way that the treewidth of the resulting TL expression also increases. This sheds light on another open problem from Maron et al. (2019a) where it was asked whether polynomial layers (in  $A$ ) increase the separation power.

As example, consider an architecture of the form  $\sigma(A^3 \cdot F \cdot W)$ , using the adjacency matrix  $A$  raised to the power three. A naive representation results in expressions in  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$  containing  $\sum_{x_2} \sum_{x_3} \sum_{x_4} E(x_1, x_2) \cdot E(x_2, x_3) \cdot E(x_3, x_4)$ . The variables involved form a path resulting in the expressions having a treewidth of one. As a consequence of Proposition 4.5, such an architectures is bounded already by  $\mathsf{wI}_1^{(3)}$  (and in fact by  $\mathsf{cr}^{(3)}$ ) in separation power. On the other hand, consider a layer of the form  $\sigma(C \cdot F \cdot W)$  where  $C_{ij}$  holds the number of cliques containing the edge  $ij$ . Then, in  $\mathsf{TL}(\Omega)$  we get expressions containing  $\sum_{x_2} \sum_{x_3} E(x_1, x_2) \cdot E(x_1, x_3) \cdot E(x_2, x_3)$ . The variables form a 3-clique resulting in expressions of treewidth two. As a consequence, the separation power will be bounded by  $\mathsf{wI}_2^{(2)}$ . These examples show that it is not the number of multiplications (in both cases two) that gives power, it is how the variables are connected to each other.

# 6 FUNCTION APPROXIMATION

We next provide characterizations of the invariant or equivariant functions that can be approximated by TL expressions, when interpreted as functions. In combination with our separation results, we recover and extend results from Azizian & Lelarge (2021) regarding approximation properties of GNNs. In particular, our results take the number of layers of GNNs into account, and we also provide new results in the context of color refinement.

# 6.1 GENERAL TL APPROXIMATION RESULTS

Let  $\mathcal{F}$  be a set of functions  $f:\mathcal{G}_s\to \mathbb{R}^{\ell_f}$  and define its closure  $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$  as all functions  $h$  from  $\mathcal{G}_s$  for which there exists a sequence  $f_{1},f_{2},\ldots \in \mathcal{F}$  such that  $\lim_{i\to \infty}\sup_{G,\pmb {v}}\| f_i(G,\pmb {v}) - h(G,\pmb {v})\| = 0$  for some norm  $\| .\|$ . We assume  $\mathcal{F}$  to satisfy two properties. First,  $\mathcal{F}$  is concatenation-closed: if  $f_{1}:\mathcal{G}_{s}\to \mathbb{R}^{p}$  and  $f_{2}:\mathcal{G}_{s}\to \mathbb{R}^{q}$  are in  $\mathcal{F}$ , then  $g\coloneqq (f_1,f_2):\mathcal{G}_s\to \mathbb{R}^{p + q}:(G,\pmb {v})\mapsto (f_1(G,\pmb {v}),f_2(G,\pmb {v}))$  is also in  $\mathcal{F}$ . Second,  $\mathcal{F}$  is function-closed, for a fixed  $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$ : for any  $f\in \mathcal{F}$  such that  $f:\mathcal{G}_s\to \mathbb{R}^p$ , also  $g\circ f:\mathcal{G}_s\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$  is in  $\mathcal{F}$  for any continuous function  $g:\mathbb{R}^p\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ .

For such  $\mathcal{F}$ , we let  $\mathcal{F}_{\ell}$  be the subset of functions in  $\mathcal{F}$  from  $\mathcal{G}_s$  to  $\mathbb{R}^{\ell}$ . Our next result is based on a generalized Stone-Weierstrass Theorem (Timofte, 2005), also used in Azizian & Lelarge (2021).

Theorem 6.1. For any  $\ell$ , and any set  $\mathcal{F}$  of functions, concatenation and function closed for  $\ell$ , we have:  $\overline{\mathcal{F}}_{\ell} = \{f:\mathcal{G}_{s}\to \mathbb{R}^{\ell}\mid \rho_{s}(\mathcal{F})\subseteq \rho_{s}(f)\}$ .

This result gives us insight on which functions can be approximated by, for example, a set  $\mathcal{F}$  of functions originating from a class of GNNs. In this case,  $\overline{\mathcal{F}}_{\ell}$  represent all functions approximated by instances of such a class and Theorem 6.1 tells us that this set corresponds precisely to the set of all functions that are equally or less separating than the GNNs in this class. If, in addition,  $\mathcal{F}_{\ell}$  is more separating that CR or  $k$ -WL, then we can say more. Let  $\mathrm{alg} \in \{\mathrm{cr}^{(t)}, \mathrm{gcr}^{(t)}, \mathrm{vw}|_k^{(t)}, \mathrm{gw}|_k^{(\infty)}\}$ .

Corollary 6.2. Under the assumptions of Theorem 6.1 and if  $\rho(\mathcal{F}_{\ell}) = \rho(\mathrm{alg})$ , then  $\overline{\mathcal{F}_{\ell}} = \{f : \mathcal{G}_s \to \mathbb{R}^{\ell} \mid \rho(\mathrm{alg}) \subseteq \rho(f)\}$ .

We remark that the properties of being concatenation and function-closed are naturally satisfied for sets of functions representable in our tensor languages, as long as  $\Omega$  contains all continuous functions  $g: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ , for any  $p$ . Furthermore, Lemma 32 in Azizian & Lelarge (2021) implies that we can equivalently populate  $\Omega$  with all MLPs.

Together with our results in Section 4, the corollary implies that  $\mathsf{GTL}^{(t)}(\Omega)$ ,  $\mathsf{TLL}_{2}^{(t + 1)}(\Omega)$ ,  $\mathsf{TLL}_{k + 1}^{(t)}(\Omega)$  or  $\mathsf{TLL}(\Omega)$ , when viewed as functions, can approximate all functions with equal or less separation power than  $\mathsf{cr}^{(t)}$ ,  $\mathsf{gcr}^{(t)}$ ,  $\mathsf{vw}|_{k}^{(t)}$  or  $\mathsf{gw}|_{k}^{(\infty)}$ , respectively. Interestingly, Proposition 3.1 tells that the closure necessarily consists of invariant (when  $s = 0$ ) and equivariant (when  $s > 0$ ) functions.

# 6.2 CONSEQUENCES FOR GNNS

All our results combined provide a recipe to guarantee that a given function can be approximated by GNN architectures. Indeed, let  $f$  be a function that is not more separating than  $\mathsf{cr}^{(t)}$  (respectively,  $\mathsf{gcr}^{(t)}$ ,  $\mathsf{vw}l_{k}^{(t)}$  or  $\mathsf{gw}l_{k}^{(\infty)}$ , for some  $k \geq 1$ ). Most classes of GNNs in the literature are concatenation-closed and allow the application of arbitrary MLPs. Then,  $f$  can be approximated by a class of GNNs, as long as these are at least as separating as  $\mathsf{GTL}^{(t)}$  (respectively,  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_{2}^{(t + 1)}$ ,  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_{k + 1}^{(t)}$  or  $\mathsf{T}\mathsf{L}_{k + 1}^{(\infty)}$ ). This, in turn, amounts to showing that the GNNs can be represented in the corresponding tensor language fragment, and that they can match the corresponding labeling algorithm in separation power.

For example,  $\overline{\mathrm{GIN}}_{\ell}^{(t)}$  contains any function  $f:\mathcal{G}_1\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$  satisfying  $\rho_1(\mathsf{cr}^{(t)})\subseteq \rho_1(f)$ ;  $\overline{\mathrm{eGIN}}_{\ell}^{(t)}$  any function satisfying  $\rho_{1}(\mathsf{w}\mathsf{l}_{1}^{(t)})\subseteq \rho_{1}(f)$ ; and when extended with a readout layer, their closures consist of functions  $f:\mathcal{G}_0\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$  satisfying  $\rho_0(\mathsf{gcr}^{(t)}) = \rho_0(\mathsf{vw}\mathsf{l}_1^{(t)})\subseteq \rho_0(f)$ . Also,  $\overline{k - FGNN_{\ell}^{(t)}}$  consists of functions  $f$  such that  $\rho_{1}(\mathsf{vw}\mathsf{l}_{k}^{(t)})\subseteq \rho_{1}(f)$ . We thus recover and extend the results by Azizian & Lelarge (2021) by incorporating layer information  $(t)$  and by treating color refinement separately from 1-WL for vertex embeddings. We remark, however, that Azizian and Lelarge define equivariant layers of GNNs in a slightly different way. Furthermore, Theorem 5.1 implies that  $(k + 1)\text{-IGN}_{\ell}$  consists of functions  $f$  satisfying  $\rho_{1}(\mathsf{vw}\mathsf{l}_{k}^{(\infty)})\subseteq \rho_{1}(f)$  and  $\rho_0(\mathsf{gw}\mathsf{l}_k^{(\infty)})\subseteq \rho_0(f)$ , cases left open in Azizian & Lelarge (2021).

All these results follow directly from Corollary 6.2, the fact that the respective classes of GNNs can simulate CR or  $k$ -WL (Xu et al., 2019; Barceló et al., 2020; Maron et al., 2019b), and that they can be represented in the corresponding tensor language (Section 4). A further consequence is that we can use these GNNs to approximate functions representable in our tensor languages. For example,  $\overline{\mathrm{GIN}}_{\ell}^{(t)} = \overline{\mathrm{GTL}}^{(t)}(\Omega)$ , and similarly for the other classes of GNNs and tensor language fragments.

# 7 CONCLUSION

The connection between GNNs and tensor languages allows us to translate our general analysis of tensor languages into a much cleaner understanding of the separation and approximation power of GNNs. In a nutshell, the number of indices and summation depth needed to represent the layers in GNNs determine their separation power in terms of color refinement and  $k$ -dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman tests. Our approach, thus, provides a handy toolbox to understand existing and new GNN architectures, and we demonstrate this by recovering several results about the power of GNNs presented recently in the literature, as well as proving some additional results not known before.
