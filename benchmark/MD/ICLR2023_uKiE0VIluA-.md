# ABSTRACT

This paper builds bridges between two families of probabilistic algorithms: (hierarchical) variational inference (VI), which is typically used to model distributions over continuous spaces, and generative flow networks (GFlowNets), which have been used for distributions over discrete structures such as graphs. We demonstrate that, in certain cases, VI algorithms are equivalent to special cases of GFlowNets in the sense of equality of expected gradients of their learning objectives. We then point out the differences between the two families and show how these differences emerge experimentally. Notably, GFlowNets, which borrow ideas from reinforcement learning, are more amenable than VI to off-policy training without the cost of high gradient variance induced by importance sampling. We argue that this property of GFlowNets can provide advantages for capturing diversity in multimodal target distributions.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Many probabilistic generative models produce a sample through a sequence of stochastic choices. Non-neural latent variable models (e.g., Blei et al., 2003), autoregressive models, hierarchical variational autoencoders (Sonderby et al., 2016), and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) can be said to rely upon a shared principle: richer distributions can be modeled by chaining together a sequence of simple actions, whose conditional distributions are easy to describe, than by performing generation in a single sampling step. When many intermediate sampled variables could generate the same object, making exact likelihood computation intractable, hierarchical models are trained with variational objectives that involve the posterior over the sampling sequence (Ranganath et al., 2016b).

This work connects variational inference (VI) methods for hierarchical models (i.e., sampling through a sequence of choices conditioned on the previous ones) with the emerging area of research on generative flow networks (GFlowNets; Bengio et al., 2021a). GFlowNets have been formulated as a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm – with states, actions, and rewards – that constructs an object by a sequence of actions so as to make the marginal likelihood of producing an object proportional to its reward. While hierarchical VI is typically used for distributions over real-valued objects, GFlowNets have been successful at approximating distributions over discrete structures for which exact sampling is intractable, such as for molecule discovery (Bengio et al., 2021a), for Bayesian posteriors over causal graphs (Deleu et al., 2022), or as an amortized learned sampler for approximate maximum-likelihood training of energy-based models (Zhang et al., 2022b). Although GFlowNets appear to have different foundations (Bengio et al., 2021b) and applications than hierarchical VI algorithms, we show here that the two are closely connected.

As our main theoretical contribution, we show that special cases of variational algorithms and GFlowNets coincide in their expected gradients. In particular, hierarchical VI (Ranganath et al., 2016b) and nested VI (Zimmermann et al., 2021) are related to the trajectory balance and detailed balance objectives for GFlowNets (Malkin et al., 2022; Bengio et al., 2021b). We also point out the differences between VI and GFlowNets: notably, that GFlowNets automatically perform gradient variance reduction by estimating a marginal quantity (the partition function) that acts as a baseline and allow off-policy learning without the need for reweighted importance sampling.

Our theoretical results are accompanied by experiments that examine what similarities and differences emerge when one applies hierarchical VI algorithms to discrete problems where GFlowNets have been used before. These experiments serve two purposes. First, they supply a missing hierarchical VI baseline for problems where GFlowNets have been used in past work. The relative performance of this baseline illustrates the aforementioned similarities and differences between VI and GFlowNets. Second, the experiments demonstrate the ability of GFlowNets, not shared by hierarchical VI, to learn from off-policy distributions without introducing high gradient variance. We

show that this ability to learn with exploratory off-policy sampling is beneficial in discrete probabilistic modeling tasks, especially in cases where the target distribution has many modes.

# 2 THEORETICAL RESULTS

# 2.1 GFLOWNETS: NOTATION AND BACKGROUND

We consider the setting of Bengio et al. (2021a). We are given a pointed directed acyclic graph (DAG)  $\mathcal{G} = (S, \mathbb{A})$ , where  $S$  is a finite set of vertices (states), and  $\mathbb{A} \subset S \times S$  is a set of directed edges (actions). If  $s \to s'$  is an action, we say  $s$  is a parent of  $s'$  and  $s'$  is a child of  $s$ . There is exactly one state that has no incoming edge, called the initial state  $s_0 \in S$ . States that have no outgoing edges are called terminating. We denote by  $\mathcal{X}$  the set of terminating states. A complete trajectory is a sequence  $\tau = (s_0 \to \ldots \to s_n)$  such that each  $s_i \to s_{i+1}$  is an action and  $s_n \in \mathcal{X}$ . We denote by  $\mathcal{T}$  the set of complete trajectories and by  $x_\tau$  the last state of a complete trajectory  $\tau$ .

GFlowNets are a class of models that amortize the cost of sampling from an intractable target distribution over  $\mathcal{X}$  by learning a functional approximation of the target distribution using its unnormalized density or reward function,  $R: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^+$ . While there exist different parametrizations and loss functions for GFlowNets, they all define a forward transition probability function, or a forward policy,  $P_F(-|s)$ , which is a distribution over the children of every state  $s \in S$ . The forward policy is typically parametrized by a neural network that takes a representation of  $s$  as input and produces the logits of a distribution over its children. Any forward policy  $P_F$  induces a distribution over complete trajectories  $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$  (denoted by  $P_F$  as well), which in turn defines a marginal distribution over terminating states  $x \in X$  (denoted by  $P_F^\top$ ):

$$
P _ {F} (\tau = (s _ {0} \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow s _ {n})) = \prod_ {i = 0} ^ {n - 1} P _ {F} \left(s _ {i + 1} \mid s _ {i}\right) \quad \forall \tau \in \mathcal {T}, \tag {1}
$$

$$
P _ {F} ^ {\top} (x) = \sum_ {\tau \in \mathcal {T}: x _ {\tau} = x} P _ {F} (\tau) \quad \forall x \in \mathcal {X}. \tag {2}
$$

Given a forward policy  $P_F$ , terminating states  $x \in X$  can be sampled from  $P_F^\top$  by sampling trajectories  $\tau$  from  $P_F(\tau)$  and taking their final states  $x_{\tau}$ .

GFlowNets aim to find a forward policy  $P_F$  for which  $P_F^\top(x) \propto R(x)$ . Because the sum in (2) is typically intractable to compute exactly, training objectives for GFlowNets introduce auxiliary objects into the optimization. For example, the trajectory balance objective (TB; Malkin et al., 2022) introduces an auxiliary backward policy  $P_B$ , which is a learned distribution  $P_B(-|s)$  over the parents of every state  $s \in S$ , and an estimated partition function  $Z$ , typically parametrized as  $\exp(\log Z)$  where  $\log Z$  is the learned parameter. The TB objective for a complete trajectory  $\tau$  is defined as

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {T B}} (\tau ; P _ {F}, P _ {B}, Z) = \left(\log \frac {Z \cdot P _ {F} (\tau)}{R (x _ {\tau}) P _ {B} (\tau \mid x _ {\tau})}\right) ^ {2}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $P_B(\tau \mid x_\tau) = \prod_{(s \to s') \in \tau} P_B(s \mid s')$ . If  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{TB}}$  is made equal to 0 for every complete trajectory  $\tau$ , then  $P_F^\top(x) \propto R(x)$  for all  $x \in \mathcal{X}$  and  $Z$  is the inverse constant of proportionality:  $Z = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} R(x)$ .

The objective (3) is minimized by sampling trajectories  $\tau$  from some distribution and making gradient steps on (3) with respect to the parameters of  $P_F$ ,  $P_B$ , and  $\log Z$ . The distribution from which  $\tau$  is sampled amounts to a choice of scalarization weights for the multi-objective problem of minimizing (3) over all  $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$ . If  $\tau$  is sampled from  $P_F(\tau)$  - note that this is a nonstationary scalarization - we say the algorithm runs on-policy. If  $\tau$  is sampled from another distribution, the algorithm runs off-policy; typical choices are to sample  $\tau$  from a tempered version of  $P_F$  to encourage exploration (Bengio et al., 2021a; Deleu et al., 2022) or to sample  $\tau$  from the backward policy  $P_B(\tau | x)$  starting from given terminating states  $x$  (Zhang et al., 2022b). By analogy with the RL nomenclature, we call the behavior policy the one that samples  $\tau$  for the purpose of obtaining a stochastic gradient, e.g., the gradient of the objective  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{TB}}$  in (3) for the sampled  $\tau$ .

Other objectives have been studied and successfully used in past works, including detailed balance (DB; proposed by Bengio et al. (2021b) and evaluated by Malkin et al. (2022)) and subtrajectory balance (SubTB; Madan et al., 2022). In the next sections, we will show how the TB objective relates to hierarchical variational objectives. In § B, we generalize this result to the SubTB loss, of which both TB and DB are special cases.

# 2.2 HIERARCHICAL VARIATIONAL MODELS AND GFLOWNETS

Variational methods provide a way of sampling from distributions by means of learning an approximate probability density. Hierarchical variational models (HVMs; Ranganath et al., 2016b; Sobolev & Vetrov, 2019; Vahdat & Kautz, 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2021)) typically assume that the sample space is a set of sequences  $(z_{1},\ldots ,z_{n})$  of fixed length, with an assumption of conditional independence between  $z_{i - 1}$  and  $z_{i + 1}$  conditioned on  $z_{i}$ , i.e., the likelihood has a factorization  $q(z_{1},\dots,z_{n}) = q(z_{1})q(z_{2}|x_{1})\dots q(z_{n}|z_{n - 1})$ . The marginal likelihood of  $z_{n}$  in a hierarchical model involves a possibly intractable sum,

$$
q \left(z _ {n}\right) = \sum_ {z _ {1}, \dots , z _ {n - 1}} q \left(z _ {1}\right) q \left(z _ {2} \mid z _ {1}\right) \dots q \left(z _ {n} \mid z _ {n - 1}\right).
$$

The goal of VI algorithms is to find the conditional distributions  $q$  that minimize some divergence between the marginal  $q(z_{n})$  and a target distribution. The target is often given as a distribution with intractable normalization constant: a typical setting is a Bayesian posterior (used in VAEs, variational EM, and other applications), for which we desire  $q(z_{n}) \propto p_{\mathrm{likelihood}}(x|z_{n})p_{\mathrm{prior}}(z_{n})$ .

The GFlowNet corresponding to a HVM: Sampling sequences  $(z_{1},\ldots ,z_{n})$  from a hierarchical model is equivalent to sampling complete trajectories in a certain pointed DAG  $\mathcal{G}$ . The states of  $\mathcal{G}$  at a distance of  $i$  from the initial state are in bijection with possible values of the variable  $z_{i}$ , and the action distribution is given by  $q$ . Sampling from the HVM is equivalent to sampling trajectories from the policy  $P_F(z_{i + 1}|z_i) = q(z_{i + 1}|z_i)$  (and  $P_F(z_1|s_0) = q(z_1))$ , and the marginal distribution  $q(z_{n})$  is the terminating distribution  $P_F^\top$ .

The HVM corresponding to a GFlowNet: Conversely, suppose  $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{S},\mathbb{A})$  is a graded pointed DAG $^2$  and that a forward policy  $P_F$  on  $\mathcal{G}$  is given. Sampling trajectories  $\tau = (s_0\rightarrow s_1\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow s_L)$  in  $\mathcal{G}$  is equivalent to sampling from a HVM in which the random variable  $z_{i}$  is the identity of the  $(i + 1)$ -th state  $s_i$  in  $\tau$  and the conditional distributions  $q(z_{i + 1}|z_i)$  are given by the forward policy  $P_F(s_{i + 1}|s_i)$ . Specifying an approximation of the target distribution in a hierarchical model with  $n$  layers is thus equivalent to specifying a forward policy  $P_F$  in a graded DAG.

The correspondence can be extended to non-graded DAGs. Every pointed DAG  $\mathcal{G} = (S, \mathbb{A})$  can be canonically transformed into a graded pointed DAG by the insertion of dummy states that have one child and one parent. To be precise, every edge  $s \to s' \in \mathbb{A}$  is replaced with a sequence of  $\ell(s') - \ell(s) + 1$  edges, where  $\ell(s)$  is the length of the longest trajectory from  $s_0$  to  $s$ . We thus restrict our analysis in this section, without loss of generality, to graded DAGs.

The meaning of the backward policy: Typically, the target distribution is over the objects  $\mathcal{X}$  of the last layer of a graded DAG, rather than over complete sequences or trajectories. Any backward policy  $P_B$  on the DAG turns an unnormalized target distribution  $R$  over  $\mathcal{X}$  into an unnormalized distribution over complete trajectories  $\mathcal{T}$ :

$$
\forall \tau \in \mathcal {T} \quad P _ {B} (\tau) \propto R (x _ {\tau}) P _ {B} (\tau \mid x _ {\tau}), \quad \text {w i t h u n k o w n p a r t i t i o n f u n c t i o n} \hat {Z} = \sum_ {x \in \chi} R (x). \tag {4}
$$

The marginal distribution of  $P_B$  over terminating states is equal to  $R(x) / \hat{Z}$  by construction. Therefore, if  $P_F$  is a forward policy that equals  $P_B$  as a distribution over trajectories, then  $P_F^\tau (x) = R(x) / \hat{Z}\propto R(x)$ .

VI training objectives: In its most general form, the hierarchical variational objective ('HVI objective' in the remainder of the paper) minimizes a statistical divergence  $D_{f}$  between the learned and the target distributions over trajectories:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {H V I}, f} \left(P _ {F}, P _ {B}\right) = D _ {f} \left(P _ {B} \| P _ {F}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim P _ {F}} \left[ f \left(\frac {P _ {B} (\tau)}{P _ {F} (\tau)}\right) \right]. \tag {5}
$$

Two common objectives are the forward and reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences (Mnih & Gregor, 2014), corresponding to  $f: t \mapsto t \log t$  for  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_B \| P_F)$  and  $f: t \mapsto -\log t$  for  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_F \| P_B)$ , respectively. Other  $f$ -divergences have been used, as discussed in Zhang et al. (2019b); Wan et al. (2020). Note that, similar to GFlowNets, (5) can be minimized with respect to both the forward and backward policies, or can be minimized using a fixed backward policy.

Divergences between two distributions over trajectories and divergences between their two marginal distributions over terminating states distributions are linked via the data processing inequality, assuming  $f$  is convex (see e.g. Zhang et al. (2019b)), making the former a sensible surrogate objective for the latter:

$$
D _ {f} \left(R / \hat {Z} \| P _ {F} ^ {\top}\right) \leq D _ {f} \left(P _ {B} \| P _ {F}\right) \tag {6}
$$

When both  $P_B$  and  $P_F$  are learned, the divergences with respect to which they are optimized need not be the same, as long as both objectives are 0 if and only if  $P_F = P_B$ . For example, wake-sleep algorithms (Hinton et al., 1995) optimize the generative model  $P_F$  using

$D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_B\| P_F)$  and the posterior  $P_B$  using  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_F\| P_B)$ . A summary of common combinations is shown in Table 1.

We remark that tractable unbiased gradient estimators for objectives such as (5) may not always exist, as we cannot exactly sample from or compute the density of  $P_B(\tau)$  when its normalization constant  $\hat{Z}$  is unknown. For example, while the REINFORCE estimator gives unbiased estimates of the gradient with respect to  $P_F$  when the objective is REVERSE KL (see §2.3), other objectives, such as FORWARD KL, require importance-weighted estimators. Such estimators approximate sampling from  $P_B$  by sampling a batch of trajectories  $\{\tau_i\}$  from another distribution  $\pi$  (which may equal  $P_F$ ) and weighting a loss computed for each  $\tau_i$  by a scalar proportional to  $\frac{P_B(\tau_i)}{\pi(\tau_i)}$ . Such reweighted importance sampling is helpful in various variational algorithms, despite its bias when the number of samples is finite (e.g., Bornschein & Bengio, 2015; Burda et al., 2016), but it may also introduce variance that increases with the discrepancy between  $P_B$  and  $\pi$ .

# 2.3 ANALYSIS OF GRADIENTS

The following proposition summarizes our main theoretical claim, relating the GFN objective of (3) and the variational objective of (5). In §B, we extend this result by showing an equivalence between the subtrajectory balance objective (introduced in Malkin et al. (2022) and empirically evaluated in Madan et al. (2022)) and a natural extension of the nested variational objective (Zimmermann et al., 2021) to subtrajectories. A special case of this equivalence is between the Detailed Balance objective (Bengio et al., 2021b) and the nested VI objective (Zimmermann et al., 2021).

Proposition 1 Given a graded DAG  $\mathcal{G}$ , and denoting by  $\theta, \phi$  the parameters of the forward and backward policies  $P_F, P_B$  respectively, the gradients of the TB objective (3) satisfy:

$$
\nabla_ {\phi} D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(P _ {B} \| P _ {F}\right) = \frac {1}{2} \mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim P _ {B}} \left[ \nabla_ {\phi} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {T B}} (\tau) \right], \tag {7}
$$

$$
\nabla_ {\theta} D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(P _ {F} \| P _ {B}\right) = \frac {1}{2} \mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim P _ {F}} \left[ \nabla_ {\theta} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {T B}} (\tau) \right]. \tag {8}
$$

The proof of the extended result appears in  $\S B$ . An alternative proof is provided in  $\S A$ .

While (8) is the on-policy TB gradient with respect to the parameters of  $P_F$ , (7) is not the on-policy TB gradient with respect to the parameters of  $P_B$ , as the expectation is taken over  $P_B$ , not  $P_F$ . The on-policy TB gradient can however be expressed through a surrogate loss

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim P _ {F}} \left[ \nabla_ {\phi} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {T B}} (\tau) \right] = \nabla_ {\phi} \left[ D _ {\log^ {2}} \left(P _ {B} \| P _ {F}\right) + 2 \left(\log Z - \log \hat {Z}\right) D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(P _ {F} \| P _ {B}\right) \right], \tag {9}
$$

where  $\hat{Z} = \sum_{x\in \chi}R(x)$ , the unknown true partition function. Here  $D_{\log^2}$  is the pseudo- $f$ -divergence defined by  $f(x) = \log (x)^2$ , which is not convex for large  $x$ . (Proof in §A.)

The loss in (7) is not possible to optimize directly unless using importance weighting (cf. the end of §2.2), but optimization of  $P_B$  using (7) and  $P_F$  using (8) would yield the gradients of REVERSE WAKE-SLEEP in expectation.

Score function estimator and variance reduction: Optimizing the reverse KL loss  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_F \| P_B)$  with respect to  $\theta$ , the parameters of  $P_F$ , requires a likelihood ratio (also known as

REINFORCE) estimator of the gradient (Williams, 1992), using a trajectory  $\tau$  (or a batch of trajectories), which takes the form:

$$
\Delta (\tau) = \nabla_ {\theta} \log P _ {F} (\tau ; \theta) c (\tau), \quad \text {w h e r e} c (\tau) = \log \frac {P _ {F} (\tau)}{R \left(x _ {\tau}\right) P _ {B} (\tau \mid x _ {\tau})} \tag {10}
$$

(Note that the term  $\nabla_{\theta}c(\tau)$  that is typically present in the REINFORCE estimator is 0 in expectation, since  $\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim P_F}[\nabla_\theta \log P_F(\tau)] = \sum_\tau \frac{P_F(\tau)}{P_F(\tau)}\nabla_\theta P_F(\tau) = 0.$ ) The estimator of (10) is known to exhibit high variance norm, thus slowing down learning. A common workaround is to subtract a baseline  $b$  from  $c(\tau)$ , which does not bias the estimator. The value of the baseline  $b$  (also called control variate) that most reduces the trace of the covariance matrix of the gradient estimator is

$$
b ^ {*} = \frac {\mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim P _ {F}} [ c (\tau) \| \nabla_ {\theta} \log P _ {F} (\tau ; \theta) \| ^ {2} ]}{\mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim P _ {F}} [ \| \nabla_ {\theta} \log P _ {F} (\tau ; \theta) \| ^ {2} ]},
$$

commonly approximated with  $\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim P_F}[c(\tau)]$  (see, e.g., Weaver & Tao (2001); Wu et al. (2018)). This approximation is itself often approximated with a batch-dependent local baseline, from a batch of trajectories  $\{\tau_i\}_{i=1}^B$ :

$$
b ^ {\text {l o c a l}} = \frac {1}{B} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {B} c \left(\tau_ {i}\right) \tag {11}
$$

A better approximation of the expectation  $\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim P_F}[c(\tau)]$  can be obtained by maintaining a running average of the values  $c(\tau)$ , leading to a global baseline. After observing each batch of trajectories, the running average is updated with step size  $\eta$ :

$$
b ^ {\text {g l o b a l}} \leftarrow (1 - \eta) b ^ {\text {g l o b a l}} + \eta b ^ {\text {l o c a l}}. \tag {12}
$$

This coincides with the update rule of  $\log Z$  in the minimization of  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{TB}}(P_F,P_B,Z)$  with a learning rate  $\frac{\eta}{2}$  for the parameter  $\log Z$  (with respect to which the TB objective is quadratic). Consequently, (8) of Prop. 1 shows that the update rule for the parameters of  $P_F$ , when optimized using the REVERSE KL objective, with (12) as a control variate for the score function estimator of its gradient, is the same as the update rule obtained by optimizing the TB objective using on-policy trajectories.

While learning a backward policy  $P_B$  can speed up convergence (Malkin et al., 2022), the TB objective can also be used with a fixed backward policy, in which case the REVERSE KL objective and the TB objective differ only in how they reduce the variance of the estimated gradients, if the trajectories are sampled on-policy. In §4, we experimentally explore the differences between the two learning paradigms that arise when  $P_B$  is learned, or when the algorithms run off-policy.

# 3 RELATED WORK

(Hierarchical) VI: Variational inference (Zhang et al., 2019a) techniques originate from graphical models (Saul et al., 1996; Jordan et al., 2004), which typically include an inference machine and a generative machine to model the relationship between latent variables and observed data. The line of work on black-box VI (Ranganath et al., 2014) focuses on learning the inference machine given a data generating process, i.e., inferring the posterior over latent variables. Hierarchical modeling exhibits appealing properties under such settings as discussed in Ranganath et al. (2016b); Yin & Zhou (2018); Sobolev & Vetrov (2019). On the other hand, works on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) focus on generative modeling, where the inference machine – the estimated variational posterior – is a tool to assist optimization of the generative machine or decoder. Hierarchical construction of multiple latent variables has also been shown to be beneficial (Sonderby et al., 2016; Maaloe et al., 2019; Child, 2021).

While earlier works simplify the variational family with mean-field approximations (Bishop, 2006), modern inference methods rely on amortized stochastic optimization (Hoffman et al., 2013). One of the oldest and most commonly used ideas is REINFORCE (Williams, 1992; Paisley et al., 2012) which gives unbiased gradient estimation. Follow-up work (Titsias & Lázaro-Gredilla, 2014; Gregor et al., 2014; Mnih & Gregor, 2014; Mnih & Rezende, 2016) proposes advanced estimators to reduce the high variance of REINFORCE. On the other hand, path-wise gradient estimators (Kingma & Welling, 2014) have much lower variance, but have limited applicability. Later works combine these two approaches for particular distribution families (Tucker et al., 2017; Grathwohl et al., 2018).

Beyond the evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective used in most variational inference methods, more complex objectives have been studied. Tighter evidence bounds have proved beneficial to the learning of generative machines (Burda et al., 2016; Domke & Sheldon, 2018; Rainforth et al., 2018;

Masrani et al., 2019). As KL divergence optimization suffers from issues such as mean-seeking behavior and posterior variance underestimation (Minka, 2005), other divergences are adopted as in expectation propagation (Minka, 2001; Li et al., 2015), more general  $f$ -divergences (Dieng et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2020), their special case  $\alpha$ -divergences (Hernández-Lobato et al., 2016), and Stein discrepancy (Liu & Wang, 2016; Ranganath et al., 2016a). GFlowNets could be seen as providing a novel pseudo-divergence criterion, namely TB, as discussed in this work.

Wake-sleep algorithms: Another branch of work, starting with Hinton et al. (1995), proposes to avoid issues from stochastic optimization (such as REINFORCE) by alternatively optimizing the generative and inference (posterior) models. Modern versions extending this framework include reweighted wake-sleep Bornschein & Bengio (2015); Le et al. (2019) and memoised wake-sleep (Hewitt et al., 2020; Le et al., 2022). It was shown in Le et al. (2019) that wake-sleep algorithms behave well for tasks involving stochastic branching.

GFlowNets: GFlowNets have been used successfully in settings where RL and MCMC methods have been used in other work, including molecule discovery (Bengio et al., 2021a; Malkin et al., 2022; Madan et al., 2022), biological sequence design (Malkin et al., 2022; Jain et al., 2022; Madan et al., 2022), and Bayesian structure learning (Deleu et al., 2022). A connection of the theoretical foundations of GFlowNets (Bengio et al., 2021a;b) with variational methods was first mentioned by Malkin et al. (2022) and expanded in Zhang et al. (2022a).

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

The goal of the experiments is to empirically investigate two main observations consistent with the above theoretical analysis:

Observation 1. On-policy VI and TB (GFlowNet) objectives can behave similarly in some cases, when both can be stably optimized, while in others on-policy TB strikes a better compromise than either the (mode-seeking) REVERSE KL or (mean-seeking) FORWARD KL VI objectives. This claim is supported by the experiments on all three domains below.

However, in all cases, notable differences emerge. In particular, HVI training becomes more stable near convergence and is sensitive to learning rates, which is consistent with the hypotheses about gradient variance in §2.3.

Observation 2. When exploration matters, off-policy TB outperforms both on-policy TB and VI objectives, avoiding the possible high variance induced by importance sampling in off-policy VI. GFlowNets are capable of stable off-policy training without importance sampling. This claim is supported by experiments on all domains, but is especially well illustrated on the realistic domains in §4.2 and §4.3. This capability provides advantages for capturing a more diverse set of modes.

Observation 1 and Observation 2 provide evidence that off-policy TB is the best method among those tested in terms of both accurately fitting the target distribution and effectively finding modes, where the latter is particularly important for the challenging molecule graph generation and causal graph discovery problems studied below.

# 4.1 HYPERGRID: EXPLORATION OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES

In this section, we comparatively study the ability of the variational objectives and the GFlowNet objectives to learn a multimodal distribution given by its unnormalized density, or reward function,  $R$ . We use the synthetic hypergrid environment introduced by Bengio et al. (2021a) and further explored by Malkin et al. (2022). The states form a  $D$ -dimensional hypergrid with side length  $H$ , and the reward function has  $2^{D}$  flat modes near the corners of the hypergrid. The states form a pointed DAG, where the source state is the origin  $s_0 = \mathbf{0}$ , and each edge corresponds to the action of incrementing one coordinate in a state by 1 (without exiting the grid). More details about the environment are provided in § C.1. We focus on the case where  $P_B$  is learned, which has been shown to accelerate convergence (Malkin et al., 2022).

In Fig. 1, we compare how fast each learning objective discovers the 4 modes of a  $128 \times 128$  grid, with an exploration parameter  $R_0 = 0.001$  in the reward function. The gap between the learned distribution  $P_F^\top$  and the target distribution is measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the two distributions, to avoid giving a preference to one KL or the other. Additionally, we show graphical representations of the learned 2D terminating states distribution, along with the target distribution. We provide in §D details on how  $P_F^\top$  and the JSD are evaluated and how hyperparameters were optimized separately for each learning algorithm.

Figure 1: Top: The evolution of the JSD between the learned sampler  $P_F^\top$  and the target distribution on the  $128 \times 128$  grid, as a function of the number of trajectories sampled. Shaded areas represent the standard error evaluated across 5 different runs (on-policy left, off-policy right). Bottom: The average (across 5 runs) final learned distribution  $P_F^\top$  for the different algorithms, along with the target distribution. To amplify variation, the plot intensity at each grid position is resampled from the Gaussian approximating the distribution over the 5 runs. Although WS, FORWARD KL, and REVERSE WS (off-policy) find the 4 target modes, they do not model them with high precision, and produce a textured pattern at the modes, where it should be flat.

Exploration poses a challenge in this environment, given the distance that separates the different modes. We thus include in our analysis an off-policy version of each objective, where the behavior policy is different from, but related to, the trained sampler  $P_F(\tau)$ . The GFlowNet behavior policy used here encourages exploration by reducing the probability of terminating a trajectory at any state of the grid. This biases the learner towards sampling longer trajectories and helps with faster discovery of farther modes. When off-policy, the HVI gradients are corrected using importance sampling weights.

For the algorithms that use a score function estimator of the gradient (FORWARD KL, REVERSE WS, and REVERSE KL), we found that using a global baseline, as explained in §2.2, was better than using the more common local baseline in most cases (see Fig. C.1). This brings the VI methods closer to GFlowNets and thus factors out this issue from the comparison with the GFlowNet objectives.

We see from Fig. 1 that while FORWARD KL and WS – the two algorithms that use  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_B \| P_F)$  as the objective for  $P_F$  – discover the four modes of the distribution faster, they converge to a local minimum and do not model all the modes with high precision. This is due to the mean-seeking behavior of the forward KL objective, requiring that  $P_F^\top$  puts non-zero mass on terminating states  $x$  where  $R(x) > 0$ . Objectives that use the reverse KL to train the forward policy (REVERSE KL and REVERSE WS) are mode-seeking and can thus have a low loss without finding all the modes. The TB GFlowNet objective offers the best of both worlds, as it converges to a lower value of the JSD, discovers the four modes, and models them with high precision. This supports Observation 1. Additionally, in support of Observation 2, while both the TB objective and the HVI objectives benefit from off-policy sampling, TB benefits more, as convergence is greatly accelerated.

We supplement this study with a comparative analysis of the algorithms on smaller grids in §C.1.

# 4.2 MOLECULE SYNTHESIS

We study the molecule synthesis task from Bengio et al. (2021a), in which molecular graphs are generated by sequential addition of subgraphs from a library of blocks (Jin et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2012). The reward function is expressed in terms of a fixed, pretrained graph neural network  $f$  that estimates the strength of binding to the soluble epoxide hydrolase protein (Trott & Olson, 2010). To be precise,  $R(x) = f(x)^{\beta}$ , where  $f(x)$  is the output of the binding model on molecule  $x$  and  $\beta$  is a parameter that can be varied to control the entropy of the sampling model.

Figure 2: Correlation between marginal sampling log-likelihood and log-reward on the molecule generation task for different learning algorithms, showing the advantage of off-policy TB (red) against on-policy TB (orange) and both on-policy (blue) and off-policy HVI (green). For each hyperparameter setting on the  $x$ -axis ( $\alpha$  or  $\beta$ ), we take the optimal choice of the other hyperparameter ( $\beta$  or  $\alpha$ , respectively) and plot the mean and standard error region over three random seeds.

Because the number of terminating states is too large to make exact computation of the target distribution possible, we use a performance metric from past work on this task (Bengio et al., 2021a) to evaluate sampling agents. Namely, for each molecule  $x$  in a held-out set, we compute  $\log P_F^\top(x)$ , the likelihood of  $x$  under the trained model (tractably computable by dynamic programming, see § D), and evaluate the Pearson correlation of  $\log P_F^\top(x)$  and  $\log R(x)$ . This value should equal 1 for a perfect sampler, as  $\log P_F^\top(x)$  and  $\log R(x)$  would differ by a constant, the log-partition function  $\log \hat{Z}$ .

In Malkin et al. (2022), GFlowNet samplers using the DB and TB objectives, with the backward policy  $P_B$  fixed to a uniform distribution over the parents of each state, were trained off-policy. Specifically, the trajectories used for DB and TB gradient updates were sampled from a mixture of the (online) forward policy  $P_F$  and a uniform distribution at each sampling step, with a special weight depending on the trajectory length used for the termination action.

We wrote an extension of the published code of Malkin et al. (2022) with an implementation of the HVI (REVERSE KL) objective, using a reweighted importance sampling correction. We compare the off-policy TB from past work with the off-policy REVERSE KL, as well as on-policy TB and REVERSE KL objectives. (Note that on-policy TB and REVERSE KL are equivalent in expectation in this setting, since the backward policy is fixed.) Each of the four algorithms was evaluated with four values of the inverse temperature parameter  $\beta$  and of the learning rate  $\alpha$ , for a total of  $4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64$  settings. (We also experimented with the off-policy FORWARD KL / WS objective for optimizing  $P_F$ , but none of the hyperparameter settings resulted in an average correlation greater than 0.1.)

The results are shown in Fig. 2, in which, for each hyperparameter  $(\alpha$  or  $\beta)$ , we plot the performance for the optimal value of the other hyperparameter. We make three observations:

- In support of Observation 2, off-policy REVERSE KL performs poorly compared to its on-policy counterpart, especially for smoother distributions (smaller values of  $\beta$ ) where more diversity is present in the target distribution. Because the two algorithms agree in the expected gradient, this suggests that importance sampling introduces unacceptable variance into HVI gradients.  
- In support of Observation 1, the difference between on-policy REVERSE KL and on-policy TB is quite small, consistent with their gradients coinciding in the limit of descent along the full-batch gradient field. However, REVERSE KL algorithms are more sensitive to the learning rate.  
- In support of Observation 2, off-policy TB gives the best and lowest-variance fit to the target distribution, showing the importance of an exploratory training policy, especially for sparser reward landscapes (higher  $\beta$ ).

# 4.3 GENERATION OF DAGS IN BAYESIAN STRUCTURE LEARNING

Finally, we consider the problem of learning the (posterior) distribution over the structure of Bayesian networks, as studied in (Deleu et al., 2022). The goal of Bayesian structure learning is to approximate the posterior distribution  $p(G \mid \mathcal{D})$  over DAGs  $G$ , given a dataset of observations  $\mathcal{D}$ . Following Deleu et al. (2022), we treat the generation of a DAG as a sequential decision problem, where directed edges are added one at a time, starting from the completely disconnected graph. Since our goal is to approximate the posterior distribution  $p(G \mid \mathcal{D})$ , we use the joint probability  $R(G) = p(G, \mathcal{D})$  as the reward function, which is proportional to the former up to a normalizing constant. Details about how this reward is computed, as well as the parametrization of the forward policy  $P_F$ , are available in §C.3. Note that similarly to §4.2, and following (Deleu et al., 2022), we leave the backward policy  $P_B$  fixed to uniform.

We only consider settings where the true posterior distribution  $p(G \mid \mathcal{D})$  can be computed exactly by enumerating all the possible DAGs  $G$  over  $d$  nodes (for  $d \leq 5$ ). This allows us to exactly compare the posterior approximations, found either with the GFlowNet objectives or HVI, with the target posterior distribution. The state space grows rapidly with the number of nodes (e.g., there are 29k DAGs over  $d = 5$  nodes). For each experiment, we sampled a dataset  $\mathcal{D}$  of 100 observations from a randomly generated ground-truth graph  $G^{\star}$ ; the size of  $\mathcal{D}$  was chosen to obtain highly multimodal posteriors. In addition to the (Modified) DB objective introduced by Deleu et al. (2022), we also study the TB (GFlowNet) and the REVERSE KL (HVI) objectives, both on-policy and off-policy.

In Table 2, we compare the posterior approximations found using these different objectives in terms of their Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) to the target posterior distribution  $P(G \mid \mathcal{D})$ . We observe that on the easiest setting (graphs over  $d = 3$  nodes), all methods accurately approximate the posterior distribution. But as we increase the complexity of the problem (with larger graphs), we observe that the accuracy of the approximation found with Off-Policy REVERSE KL degrades significantly, while the ones found with the off-policy GFlowNet objectives ((Modified) DB & TB) remain very accurate. We also note that the performance of On-Policy TB and On-Policy REVERSE KL degrades too, but not as significantly; furthermore, both of these methods achieve similar performance across all experimental settings, confirming our Observation 1, and the connection highlighted in §2.2. The consistent behavior of the off-policy GFlowNet objectives compared to the on-policy objectives (TB & REVERSE KL) as the problem increases in complexity (i.e., as the number of nodes  $d$  increases, requiring better exploration) also supports our Observation 2. These observations are further confirmed when comparing the edge marginals  $P(X_{i} \to X_{j} \mid \mathcal{D})$  in Fig. C.3 (\$C.3), computed either with the target posterior distribution or with the posterior approximations.

# 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The theory and experiments in this paper place GFlowNets, which had been introduced and motivated as a reinforcement learning method, in the family of variational methods. They suggest that off-policy GFlowNet objectives may be an advantageous replacement to previous VI objectives, especially when the target distribution is highly multimodal, striking an interesting balance between the mode-seeking (REVERSE KL) and mean-seeking (FORWARD KL) VI variants. This work should prompt more research on how best to choose the behavior policy in off-policy GFlowNet training, seen as a means to efficiently explore and discover modes. Whereas the experiments performed here focused on the realm of discrete variables (on which all past GFlowNet work has been), future work should also investigate GFlowNets for continuous action spaces – whose theory has already been introduced by Bengio et al. (2021b) – as potential alternatives to VI in continuous-variable domains.
