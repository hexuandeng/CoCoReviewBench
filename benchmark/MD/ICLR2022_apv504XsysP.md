# ABSTRACT

Solving the Schrödinger equation is key to many quantum mechanical properties. However, an analytical solution is only tractable for single-electron systems. Recently, neural networks succeeded at modelling wave functions of many-electron systems. Together with the variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) framework, this led to solutions on par with the best known classical methods. Still, these neural methods require tremendous amounts of computational resources as one has to train a separate model for each molecular geometry. In this work, we combine a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a neural wave function to simultaneously solve the Schrödinger equation for multiple geometries via VMC. This enables us to model continuous subsets of the potential energy surface with a single training pass. Compared to existing state-of-the-art networks, our Potential Energy Surface Network (PESNet) speeds up training for multiple geometries by up to 40 times while matching or surpassing their accuracy. This may open the path to accurate and orders of magnitude cheaper quantum mechanical calculations.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, machine learning gained importance in computational quantum physics and chemistry to accelerate material discovery by approximating quantum mechanical (QM) calculations (Huang & von Lilienfeld, 2021). In particular, a lot of work has gone into building surrogate models to reproduce QM properties, e.g., energies. These models learn from datasets created using classical techniques such as density functional theory (DFT) (Ramakrishnan et al., 2014; Klicpera et al., 2019) or coupled clusters (CCSD) (Chmiela et al., 2018). While this approach has shown great success in recovering the baseline calculations, it suffers from several disadvantages. Firstly, due to the tremendous success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in this area, the regression target quality became the limiting factor for accuracy (Klicpera et al., 2019; Qiao et al., 2021; Batzner et al., 2021), i.e., the network's prediction is closer to the data label than the data label is to the actual prop

Figure 1: Schematic of PESNet. For each molecular structure (top row), the MetaGNN takes the nuclei graph and parametrizes the WFModel via  $\omega$  and  $\omega_{m}$ . Given these, the WFModel evaluates the electronic wave function  $\psi (\vec{r})$ .

erty. Secondly, these surrogate models are subject to the usual difficulties of neural networks such as overconfidence outside the training domain (Pappu & Paige, 2020; Guo et al., 2017).

In orthogonal research, neural networks have been used as wave function Ansätze to solve the stationary Schrödinger equation (Kessler et al., 2021; Han et al., 2019). These methods use the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) (Ceperley et al., 1977) framework to iteratively optimize a neural wave function to obtain the ground-state electronic wave function of a given system. Chemists refer to such methods as ab-initio, whereas the machine learning community may refer to this as a form of self-generative learning as no dataset is required. The data (electron positions) are sampled from the wave function itself, and the loss is derived from the Schrödinger equation (Ceperley et al., 1977). This approach has shown great success as multiple authors report results outperforming the traditional

tional 'gold-standard' CCSD on various systems (Pfau et al., 2020; Hermann et al., 2020). However, these techniques require expensive training for each geometry, resulting in high computational requirements and, thus, limiting their application to small sets of configurations.

In this work, we accelerate VMC with neural wave functions by proposing an architecture that solves the Schrödinger equation for multiple systems simultaneously. The core idea is to predict a set of parameters such that a given wave function, e.g., FermiNet (Pfau et al., 2020), solves the Schrödinger equation for a specific geometry. Previously, these parameters were obtained by optimizing a separate wave function for each geometry. We improve this procedure by generating the parameters with a GNN, as illustrated in Figure 1. This enables us to capture continuous subsets of the potential energy surface in one training pass, removing the need for costly retraining. Additionally, we take inspiration from supervised surrogate networks and enforce the invariances of the energy to physical symmetries such as translation, rotation, and reflection (Schütt et al., 2018). While these symmetries hold for observable metrics such as energies, the wave function itself may not have these symmetries. We solve this issue by defining a coordinate system that is equivariant to the symmetries of the energy. In our experiments, our Potential Energy Surface Network (PESNet) consistently matches or surpasses the results of the previous best neural wave functions while training less than  $\frac{1}{40}$  of the time for high-resolution potential energy surface scans.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Molecular property prediction has seen a surge in publications in recent years with varying goals. Here, we focus on the prediction of QM properties such as the energy of a system. Classically, features were constructed by hand and fed into a machine learning model to predict target properties (Christensen et al., 2020; Behler, 2011; Bartók et al., 2013). Recently, GNNs have proven to be more accurate and took over the field (Yang et al., 2019; Klicpera et al., 2019; Schütt et al., 2018). As GNNs approach the accuracy limit, recent work focuses on improving generalization by integrating calculations from computational chemistry. For instance, QDF (Tsubaki & Mizoguchi, 2020) and EANN (Zhang et al., 2019) approximate the electron density while OrbNet (Qiao et al., 2020) and UNiTE (Qiao et al., 2021) include features taken from QM calculations. Another promising direction is  $\Delta$ -ML models, which only predict the delta between a high-accuracy QM calculation and a faster low-accuracy one (Wengert et al., 2021). Despite their success, surrogate models lack reliability. Even if uncertainty estimates are available (Lamb & Paige, 2020; Hirschfeld et al., 2020) generalization outside of the training regime is unpredictable (Guo et al., 2017).

Neural wave function Ansätze. While solving the Schrödinger equation has classically been done by self-consistent field (SCF) methods such as Hartree-Fock, DFT, or CCSD (Szabo & Oaslund, 2012), the VMC approach regained attention in combination with the flexibility of neural networks (Kessler et al., 2021; Han et al., 2019). However, early works were limited to small systems and low accuracy. Recently, FermiNet (Pfau et al., 2020) and PauliNet (Hermann et al., 2020) presented more scalable approaches and accuracy on par with best traditional QM computations. To further improve accuracy, Wilson et al. (2021) coupled FermiNet with diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC). But, all these methods need to be trained for each configuration individually. To address this issue, weight-sharing has been proposed to reduce the time per training, but this was initially limited to non-fermionic systems (Yang et al., 2020). In a concurrent work, Scherbela et al. (2021) extend this idea to electronic wave functions. However, their DeepErwin model still requires separate models for each geometry, does not account for symmetries and achieves lower accuracy, as we show in Section 4. Other efforts have aimed at accelerating Ansätze by replacing costly determinant operations, but this comes at a significant loss of accuracy (Acevedo et al., 2020).

# 3 METHOD

Our goal is to build a single model that solves the Schrödinger equation for many geometries simultaneously while accounting for the symmetries of the energy. We use three central ingredients to achieve this.

Firstly, to solve the Schrödinger equation, we leverage the VMC framework, i.e., we iteratively update our wave function model (WFModel) until it converges to the ground-state electronic wave function. The WFModel  $\psi_{\theta}(\vec{\pmb{r}}): \mathbb{R}^{3N} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  is a function parametrized by  $\theta$  that maps electron

Figure 2: PESNet's architecture is split into two main components, the MetaGNN and the WFModel. Circles indicate parameter-free and rectangles parametrized functions,  $\circ \parallel \circ$  denotes the vector concatenation,  $\mathbb{A}^{\uparrow}$  and  $\mathbb{A}^{\downarrow}$  denote the index sets of the spin-up and spin-down electrons, respectively. To avoid clutter, we left out residual connections.

configurations to amplitudes. It must obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, i.e., the sign of the output must flip under the exchange of two electrons of the same spin. As we cover in Section 3.4, the WFModel is essential for sampling electron configurations and computing energies.

Secondly, we extend this to multiple geometries by introducing a GNN that reparametrizes the WF-Model. In reference to the meta-learning literature, we call this the MetaGNN. It takes as input the nuclei coordinates  $\vec{R}_m$  and charges  $Z_{m}$  and outputs subsets  $\omega ,\omega_{m}\subset \theta ,m\in \{1,\ldots ,M\}$  of WFModel's parameters. Thanks to the message passing of GNNs, the MetaGNN can capture the full 3D geometry of the nuclei graph.

Lastly, as we prove in Appendix A, to predict energies invariant to rotations and reflections the wave function needs to be equivariant. We accomplish this by constructing an equivariant coordinate system  $\pmb{E} = [\vec{e}_1, \vec{e}_2, \vec{e}_3]$  based on the principle component analysis (PCA).

Together, these components form PESNet, whose architecture is shown in Figure 2. Since sampling and energy computations only need the WFModel, we only need a single forward pass of the MetaGNN for each geometry during evaluation. Furthermore, its end-to-end differentiability facilitates optimization, see Section 3.4, and we may benefit from better generalization thanks to our equivariant wave function (Elesedy & Zaidi, 2021; Kondor & Trivedi, 2018).

Notation. We use bold lower-case letters  $\pmb{h}$  for vectors, bold upper-case  $\pmb{W}$  letters for matrices,  $\overrightarrow{\text{arrows}}$  to indicate vectors in 3D,  $\overrightarrow{\pmb{r}}_i$  to denote electron coordinates,  $\overrightarrow{\pmb{R}}_m, Z_m$  for nuclei coordinates and charge, respectively.  $[\circ, \circ]$  and  $[\circ]_{i=1}^{N}$  denote vector concatenations.

# 3.1 WAVE FUNCTION MODEL

We use the FermiNet (Pfau et al., 2020) architecture and augment it with a new feature construction that is invariant to reindexing nuclei. In the original FermiNet, the inputs to the first layer are simply concatenations of the electron-nuclei distances. While this proved to be an effective embedding, the features of the vectors permute if the nuclei indexing changes. To circumvent this issue, we propose a new feature construction as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {1} = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \operatorname {M L P} \left(\boldsymbol {W} \left[ (\overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}} _ {i} - \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {m}) \boldsymbol {E}, \| \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}} _ {i} - \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {m} \| \right] + \boldsymbol {z} _ {m}\right), \tag {1}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {g} _ {i, j} ^ {1} = \left(\left(\overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}} _ {i} - \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}} _ {j}\right) \boldsymbol {E}, \| \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}} _ {i} - \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}} _ {j} \|\right) \tag {2}
$$

where  $z_{m}$  is an embedding of the  $m$ -th nuclei and  $\pmb{E} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$  is our equivariant coordinate system, see Section 3.3. By summing over all nuclei instead of concatenating we obtain the desired invariance. The features are then iteratively updated using the update rule from Wilson et al. (2021)

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {t + 1} = \sigma \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {\text {s i n g l e}} ^ {t} \left[ \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {t}, \sum_ {j \in \mathbb {A} ^ {\uparrow}} \boldsymbol {g} _ {i, j} ^ {t}, \sum_ {j \in \mathbb {A} ^ {\downarrow}} \boldsymbol {g} _ {i, j} ^ {t} \right] + \boldsymbol {b} _ {\text {s i n g l e}} ^ {t} + \boldsymbol {W} _ {\text {g l o b a l}} ^ {t} \left[ \sum_ {j \in \mathbb {A} ^ {\uparrow}} \boldsymbol {h} _ {j} ^ {t}, \sum_ {j \in \mathbb {A} ^ {\downarrow}} \boldsymbol {h} _ {j} ^ {t} \right]\right), \tag {3}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {g} _ {i j} ^ {t + 1} = \sigma \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {\text {d o u b l e}} ^ {t} \boldsymbol {h} _ {i j} ^ {t} + \boldsymbol {b} _ {\text {d o u b l e}} ^ {t}\right) \tag {4}
$$

where  $\sigma$  is an activation function,  $\mathbb{A}^{\uparrow}$  and  $\mathbb{A}^{\downarrow}$  are the index sets of the spin-up and spin-down electrons, respectively. We also add skip connections where possible. We chose  $\sigma \coloneqq \tanh$  since it must be at least twice differentiable to compute the energy, see Section 3.4.

After  $L_{\mathrm{WF}}$  many updates, we take the electron embeddings  $h_i^{L_{\mathrm{WF}}}$  and construct  $K$  orbitals:

$$
\phi_ {i j} ^ {k \alpha} = \left(\boldsymbol {w} _ {i} ^ {k \alpha} \boldsymbol {h} _ {j} ^ {L _ {\mathrm {W F}}} + b _ {\text {o r b i t a l}, i} ^ {k \alpha}\right) \sum_ {m} ^ {M} \pi_ {i m} ^ {k \alpha} \exp \left(- \sigma_ {i m} ^ {k \alpha} \| \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}} _ {j} - \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {m} \|\right), \tag {5}
$$

$$
\pi_ {i m} ^ {k \alpha} = \operatorname {S i g m o i d} \left(p _ {i m} ^ {k \alpha}\right),
$$

$$
\sigma_ {i m} ^ {k \alpha} = \operatorname {S o f t p l u s} (s _ {i m} ^ {k \alpha})
$$

where  $k \in \{1, \dots, K\}$ ,  $\alpha \in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}$ ,  $i, j \in \mathbb{A}^{\alpha}$ , and  $\pmb{p}_i, \pmb{s}_i$  are free parameters. Here, we use the sigmoid and softplus functions to ensure the wave function decays to 0 if an electron moves infinitely far away from any nuclei.

The output of the wave function is then the weighted sum of determinants

$$
\psi (\vec {r}) = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} w _ {k} \det \phi^ {k \uparrow} \det \phi^ {k \downarrow}. \tag {6}
$$

The determinants satisfy the antisymmetry to the exchange of same-spin electrons (Hutter, 2020). For numerical stability, we compute the final output in the log-domain and use the log-sum-exp trick.

# 3.2 METAGNN

The MetaGNN's task is to adapt the WFModel to the Hamiltonian of the current system. It does so by substituting subsets,  $\omega$  and  $\omega_{m}$ , of WFModel's parameters. While  $\omega_{m}$  contains parameters specific to nuclei  $m$ ,  $\omega$  is a set of nuclei-independent parameters such as biases. To capture the geometry of the nuclei, the GNN embeds the nuclei in a vector space and updates the embeddings via learning message passing. Contrary to surrogate GNNs, we also account for the position in our equivariant coordinate system when initializing the node embeddings to avoid identical embeddings in symmetric structures. Hence, our node embeddings are initialized by

$$
\boldsymbol {l} _ {m} ^ {1} = \left[ \boldsymbol {G} _ {Z _ {m}}, f _ {\text {p o s}} \left(\overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {m} ^ {\prime} \boldsymbol {E}\right) \right] \tag {7}
$$

where  $G$  is a matrix of charge embeddings,  $Z_{m}\in \mathbb{N}_{+}$  is the charge of nucleus  $m$ ,  $f_{\mathrm{pos}}:\mathbb{R}^3\mapsto \mathbb{R}^{N_{\mathrm{SBF}}\cdot N_{\mathrm{RBF}}}$  is our positional encoding function, and  $\overline{\pmb{R}}_m^{\prime}\pmb{E}$  is the relative position of the  $m$ th nucleus in our equivariant coordinate system  $\pmb{E}$  (see Section 3.3). As positional encoding function, we use the spherical Fourier-Bessel basis functions  $\tilde{a}_{\mathrm{SBF},ln}$  from Klicpera et al. (2019)

$$
f _ {\text {p o s}} (\vec {\boldsymbol {x}}) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {3} \left[ \tilde {a} _ {\mathrm {S B F}, l n} \left(\| \vec {\boldsymbol {x}} \|, \angle \left(\vec {\boldsymbol {x}}, \vec {\boldsymbol {e}} _ {i}\right)\right) \right] _ {l \in \{0, \dots , N _ {\mathrm {S B F}} - 1 \}, n \in \{1, \dots , N _ {\mathrm {R B F}} \}} \tag {8}
$$

with  $\vec{e}_i$  being the  $i$ th axis of our equivariant coordinate system  $\pmb{E}$ . Unlike Klicpera et al. (2019), we are working on the fully connected graph and, thus, neither include a cutoff nor the envelope function that decays to 0 at the cutoff.

A message passing layer consists of a message function  $f_{\mathrm{msg}}$  and an update function  $f_{\mathrm{update}}$ . Together, one can compute an update to the embeddings as

$$
\boldsymbol {l} _ {m} ^ {t + 1} = f _ {\text {u p d a t e}} ^ {l} \left(\boldsymbol {l} _ {m} ^ {t}, \sum_ {n} f _ {\text {m s g}} ^ {t} \left(\boldsymbol {l} _ {m} ^ {t}, \boldsymbol {l} _ {n} ^ {t}, \boldsymbol {e} _ {m n}\right)\right) \tag {9}
$$

where  $e_{mn}$  is an embedding of the edge between nucleus  $m$  and nucleus  $n$ . We use Bessel radial basis functions to encode the distances between nuclei (Klicpera et al., 2019). Both  $f_{\mathrm{msg}}$  and  $f_{\mathrm{update}}$  are realized by simple feed-forward neural networks with residual connections.

After  $L_{\mathrm{GNN}}$  many message passing steps, we compute WFModel's parameters on two levels. On the global level,  $f_{\mathrm{global}}^{\mathrm{out}}$  outputs the biases of the network and, on the node level,  $f_{\mathrm{node}}^{\mathrm{out}}$  outputs nuclei specific parameters:

$$
\boldsymbol {\omega} = \left[ \boldsymbol {b} _ {\text {s i n g l e / d o u b l e}} ^ {1}, \dots , \boldsymbol {b} _ {1} ^ {\uparrow / \downarrow}, \dots , \boldsymbol {w} \right] := f _ {\text {g l o b a l}} ^ {\text {o u t}} \left(\left[ \sum_ {m} \boldsymbol {l} _ {m} ^ {t} \right] _ {t = 1} ^ {L _ {\mathrm {G N N}}}\right), \tag {10}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {\omega} _ {m} = \left[ \boldsymbol {z} _ {m}, \boldsymbol {s} _ {m} ^ {1, \uparrow / \downarrow}, \dots , \boldsymbol {p} _ {m} ^ {1, \uparrow / \downarrow}, \dots \right] := f _ {\text {n o d e}} ^ {\text {o u t}} \left(\left[ \boldsymbol {l} _ {m} ^ {t} \right] _ {t = 1} ^ {L _ {\text {G N N}}} \right).
$$

We use distinct feed-forward neural networks with multiple heads for the specific types of parameters estimated to implement  $f_{\mathrm{node}}^{\mathrm{out}}$  and  $f_{\mathrm{global}}^{\mathrm{out}}$ . To stabilize the optimization, we initialize the last layers of  $f_{\mathrm{node}}^{\mathrm{out}}$  and  $f_{\mathrm{global}}^{\mathrm{out}}$  such that the biases play the dominant role.

# 3.3 EQUIVARIANT COORDINATE SYSTEMS

Incorporating symmetries helps to reduce the training space significantly. In GNNs this is done by only operating on inter-nuclei distances without a clear directionality in space, i.e., without  $x, y, z$  coordinates. While this works for predicting observable metrics such as energies, it does not work for wave functions. For instance, any such GNN could only describe spherically symmetric wave functions for the hydrogen atom despite all excited states being only point symmetric. To solve this issue, we introduce directionality in the form of a coordinate system that is equivariant to rotations and reflections. The axes of our coordinate system  $E = [\vec{e}_1, \vec{e}_2, \vec{e}_3]$  are defined by the principal components of the nuclei coordinates,  $\vec{e}_1^{\mathrm{PCA}}$ ,  $\vec{e}_2^{\mathrm{PCA}}$ ,  $\vec{e}_3^{\mathrm{PCA}}$ . Using PCA is robust to reindexing nuclei and ensures that the axes rotate with the system and form an orthonormal basis. However, as PCA only returns directions up to a sign, we have to resolve the sign ambiguity. We do this by computing an equivariant vector  $\vec{v}$ , i.e., a vector that rotates and reflects with the system, and defining the direction of the axes as

$$
\vec {e} _ {i} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \overrightarrow {e} _ {i} ^ {\mathrm {P C A}} & , \text {i f} \overrightarrow {e} _ {i} ^ {T} \overrightarrow {v} \geq 0, \\ - \overrightarrow {e} _ {i} ^ {\mathrm {P C A}} & , \text {e l s e .} \end{array} \right. \tag {11}
$$

As equivariant vector we use the difference between a weighted and the regular center of mass

$$
\overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {v}} := \frac {1}{M} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \left(\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {M} \left\| \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {m} - \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {n} \right\| ^ {2}\right) Z _ {m} \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {m} ^ {\prime}, \tag {12}
$$

$$
\overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {m} ^ {\prime} = \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {m} - \frac {1}{M} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {R}} _ {m}. \tag {13}
$$

As we discuss in more detail in Appendix B, there are edge cases that may result in nonequivariant coordinate systems. For certain geometries, two eigenvalues of the nuclei coordinates' covariance matrix may be identical. In this case, any linear combination of their respective eigenvectors is also an eigenvector breaking the equivariance to rotation. We avoid this by computing the PCA on pseudo coordinates if two eigenvalues are identical. The pseudo coordinates are constructed by stretching the molecular graph by  $\epsilon > 0$  along the direction of the shortest distance  $\vec{R}_m - \vec{R}_n$ .

Another seemingly undefined scenario arises if  $\vec{v} = 0$ . While this seems to be an issue at first, in practice it is often irrelevant as it occurs for symmetric molecules where the flipping of axes is equivalent to mirroring the whole system.

This construction results in an equivariant coordinate system that is unique, up to equivalent configurations, for each molecular graph. But, it is not guaranteed to behave smoothly with changes in the graph structure as axes may flip. In fact, it is not possible to construct a coordinate system that changes smoothly with arbitrary changes in the graph structure due to symmetries, see Appendix B.

# 3.4 OPTIMIZATION

We use the standard VMC optimization procedure (Ceperley et al., 1977) where we seek to minimize the expected energy of a wave function  $\psi_{\theta}$  parametrized by  $\pmb{\theta}$ :

$$
\mathcal {L} = \frac {\left\langle \psi_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \right| \boldsymbol {H} \left| \psi_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \right\rangle}{\left\langle \psi_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \mid \psi_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \right\rangle} \tag {14}
$$

where  $H$  is the Hamiltonian of the Schrödinger equation

$$
\boldsymbol {H} = - \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \nabla_ {i} ^ {2} + \underbrace {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = i} ^ {N} \frac {1}{\left\| \vec {r} _ {i} - \vec {r} _ {j} \right\|}} _ {V (\vec {r})} - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \frac {1}{\left\| \vec {r} _ {i} - \vec {R} _ {m} \right\|} + \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \sum_ {n = m} ^ {M} \frac {Z _ {m} Z _ {n}}{\left\| \vec {R} _ {m} - \vec {R} _ {n} \right\|} \tag {15}
$$

with  $\nabla^2$  being the Laplacian operator and  $V(\overrightarrow{r})$  describing the potential energy. Given samples from the probability distribution  $\sim \psi_{\overline{\theta}}^2 (\overrightarrow{r})$ , one can obtain an unbiased estimate of the gradient

$$
\begin{array}{l} E _ {L} (\vec {\boldsymbol {r}}) = \psi_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} ^ {- 1} (\vec {\boldsymbol {r}}) \boldsymbol {H} \psi_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\vec {\boldsymbol {r}}) \\ = - \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {3} \left[ \frac {\partial^ {2} \log | \psi |}{\partial \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}} _ {i k} ^ {2}} + \frac {\partial \log | \psi |}{\partial \overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}} _ {i k}} ^ {2} \right] + V (\overrightarrow {\boldsymbol {r}}), \tag {16} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \mathcal {L} = \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(E _ {L} - \mathbb {E} \left[ E _ {L} \right]\right) \nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \log | \psi | \right] \tag {17}
$$

with  $E_{L}$  denoting the local energy. One can see that for the energy computation, we only need the derivative of the wave function w.r.t. the electron coordinates. As these are no inputs to the MetaGNN, we do not have to differentiate through the MetaGNN to obtain the local energies. We clip the local energy as in Pfau et al. (2020) and obtain samples from  $\sim \psi_{\theta}^{2}(\vec{r})$  by Metropolis-Hastings. The gradients for the MetaGNN are computed jointly with those of the WFModel by altering Equation 17:

$$
\nabla_ {\Theta} \mathcal {L} = \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(E _ {L} - \mathbb {E} \left[ E _ {L} \right]\right) \nabla_ {\Theta} \log | \psi | \right] \tag {18}
$$

where  $\Theta$  is the joint set of WFModel and MetaGNN parameters. To obtain the gradient for multiple geometries, we compute the gradient as in Equation 18 multiple times and average. This joint gradient of the WFModel and the MetaGNN enables us to use a single training pass to simultaneously solve multiple Schrödinger equations.

While Equation 18 provides us with a raw estimate of the gradient, different techniques have been used to construct proper updates to the parameters (Hermann et al., 2020; Pfau et al., 2020). Here, we use natural gradient descent to enable the use of larger learning rates. So, instead of doing a regular gradient descent step in the form of  $\Theta^{t + 1} = \Theta^t -\eta \nabla_\Theta \mathcal{L}$ , where  $\eta$  is the learning rate, we add the inverse of the Fisher information matrix as a preconditioner

$$
\Theta^ {t + 1} = \Theta^ {t} - \eta \boldsymbol {F} ^ {- 1} \nabla_ {\Theta} \mathcal {L}, \tag {19}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {F} = \mathbb {E} \left[ \nabla_ {\Theta} \log | \psi | \nabla_ {\Theta} \log | \psi | ^ {T} \right]. \tag {20}
$$

Since the Fisher  $\pmb{F}$  scales quadratically with the numbers of parameters, we approximate  $F^{-1}\nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}$  via the conjugate gradient (CG) method (Neuscamman et al., 2012). To determine the convergence of the CG method, we follow Martens (2010) and stop based on the quadratic error. To avoid tuning the learning rate  $\eta$ , we clip the norm of the preconditioned gradient  $F^{-1}\nabla_{\Theta}\mathcal{L}$  (Pascanu et al., 2013) and use a fixed learning rate for all systems.

We pretrain all networks with the Lamb optimizer (You et al., 2020) on Hartree-Fock orbitals, i.e., we match each of the  $K$  orbitals to a Hartree-Fock orbital of a different configuration. During pretraining, only the WFModel and the final biases of the MetaGNN are optimized.

# 3.5 LIMITATIONS

While PESNet is capable of accurately modeling complex potential energy surfaces, we have not focused on architecture search yet. For instance, both the WFModel and the MetaGNN are only as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test (Xu et al., 2018). Furthermore, as we discuss in Section 4, PauliNet still offers a better initialization and converges in fewer iterations than our network. Lastly, PESNet is limited to geometries with identical electron spin configurations and, thus, the same number of electrons. We plan on addressing these issues in future work.

Figure 3: The energy of  $\mathrm{H}_4^+$  along the first reaction path (Alijah & Varandas, 2008). While PESNet and DeepErwin match the barrier height estimate of the MRCI-D-F12 calculation, PESNet estimates  $\approx 0.27\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$  lower energies. Reference data is taken from Scherbela et al. (2021).

Figure 4: Potential energy surface scan of the hydrogen rectangle. Similar to FermiNet, PESNet does not produce the fake minimum at  $90^{\circ}$ . Since PESNet respects the symmetries of the energy, we only trained on half of the config space. Reference data is taken from Pfau et al. (2020).

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

To investigate PESNet's accuracy and training time benefit, we compare it to FermiNet (Pfau et al., 2020; Spencer et al., 2020), PauliNet (Hermann et al., 2020), and DeepErwin (Scherbela et al., 2021) on diverse systems ranging from 3 to 28 electrons. Note, the concurrently developed DeepErwin was only recently released as a pre-print and still requires separate models and training for each configuration. While viewing the results on energies one should be aware that, except for PESNet, all methods must be trained separately for each configuration resulting in significantly higher training times, as discussed in Section 4.1.

While many energy differences may seem small due to their large absolute values, chemists set the threshold for chemical accuracy to  $1\mathrm{kcalmol}^{-1}\approx 1.6\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$ . Thus, seemingly small differences in energy are significant. Note that evaluation still poses an issue as the true energies are rarely known, and experimental data comes with uncertainties. To put all results into perspective, we always include high-accuracy classical reference calculations. When comparing VMC methods such as PESNet, FermiNet, PauliNet, and DeepErwin, interpretation is simple: lower energies are always better as VMC energy estimates are upper bounds of the actual energy (Szabo & Ostlund, 2012).

To analyze PESNet's ability to capture continuous subsets of the potential energy surface, we train on the continuous energy surface rather than on a discrete set of configurations for potential energy surface scans. The exact procedure and the used hyperparameters are explained in Appendix C. Also, additional ablation studies are available in Appendix D.

Transition path of  $\mathbf{H}_4^+$  and weight sharing. Scherbela et al. (2021) use the first transition path of  $\mathrm{H}_4^+$  (Alijah & Varandas, 2008) to demonstrate the acceleration gained by weight-sharing. But, they found their weight-sharing scheme to be too restrictive and additionally optimized each wave function separately. Unlike DeepErwin, our novel PESNet is actually flexible enough such that we do not need any extra optimization. In Figure 3, we see the DeepErwin results after their multi-step optimization and the energies of a single PESNet. We notice that while both methods estimate similar transition barriers PESNet results in  $\approx 0.27\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$  smaller energies which agree with the very accurate MRCI-D-F12 results ( $\approx 0.015\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$ ).

Hydrogen rectangle and symmetries. The Hydrogen rectangle is a known failure case for CCSD and CCSD(T). While the exact solution, FCI, indicates a local maximum at  $\theta = 90^{\circ}$ , both, CCSD and CCSD(T), predict local minima. Figure 4 shows that VMC methods such as FermiNet and our PESNet do not suffer from the same issue. PESNet's energies are identical to FermiNet's ( $\approx$ $0.014\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$ ) despite training only a single network on half of the configuration space. Thanks to our equivariant coordinate system, we only have to train on the first half of the potential energy surface.

Hydrogen chain. The hydrogen chain is a very common benchmark geometry that allows us to compare our method to a range of classical methods (Motta et al., 2017) as well as to FermiNet,

![](images/4e07618e3d26a6d370e5ed4c734979f297dc1c8d74b5a4cc7ce243ed1ac2097c.jpg)  
Figure 5: Potential energy surface scan of the hydrogen chain with 10 atoms. We find our PESNet to outperform PauliNet and DeepErwin strictly while matching the results of FermiNet across all configurations. Reference data is taken from Hermann et al. (2020); Pfau et al. (2020); Scherbela et al. (2021); Motta et al. (2017).

![](images/0ee53f7a5d9ab23f6f2bd8424ce414683e216db838ea90e04337f7a2add57d2e.jpg)  
Figure 6: Potential energy surface scan of the nitrogen molecule. PESNet yields very similar but slightly higher  $(\approx 0.37\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}})$  energies than FermiNet. Compared to the UCCSD(T) results, our numbers are significantly more consistent. Reference data is taken from Le Roy et al. (2006); Gdanitz (1998); Pfau et al. (2020).

PauliNet, and DeepErwin. Figure 5 shows the potential energy surface of the hydrogen chain computed by a range of methods. While our PESNet generally performs identical to FermiNet, we predict on average  $0.31\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$  lower energies. Further, we notice that our results are consistently better than PauliNet and DeepErwin despite only training a single model.

The nitrogen molecule. The nitrogen molecule poses a challenge as classical methods such as CCSD or CCSD(T) fail to reproduce the experimental results (Lyakh et al., 2012; Le Roy et al., 2006). While the accurate r12-MR-ACPF method more closely matches the experimental results, it scales factorially (Gdanitz, 1998). Pfau et al. (2020) have shown that FermiNet is capable of modeling such complex triple bonds. Here, we investigate whether PESNet is also able to reproduce these challenging wave functions accurately. To better represent both methods, we decided to compare both FermiNet as well as PESNet with 32 determinants as the performance gain is substantial for both methods. The results are shown in Figure 6. One can see that our results generally agree very well with FermiNet and are on average just  $0.37\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$  higher despite training only a single model for less than  $\frac{1}{40}$  of FermiNet's training time, see Section 4.1.

Cyclobutadiene and the MetaGNN. The automerization of cyclobutadiene is challenging due to its multi-reference nature, i.e., single reference methods such as CCSD(T) overestimate the transition barrier (Lyakh et al., 2012). In contrast, PauliNet and FermiNet had success at modelling this challenging system. Naturally, we are interested in how well PESNet can estimate the transition barrier. To be comparable to Spencer et al. (2020), we increased the number of determinants for the experiment to 32 and the single-stream size to 512. As shown in Figure 7, all neural methods converge to the same transition barrier which aligns with the highest MR-CC results at the upper end of the experimental range. But, they require different numbers of training steps and result in different total energies. PauliNet generally converges fastest, but results in the highest energies, whereas FermiNet's transition barrier converges slower but its energies are  $70\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$  smaller. Lastly, PESNet's transition barrier converges similar PauliNet's, but its energies are  $54\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$  lower than PauliNet's, placing it closer to FermiNet than PauliNet in terms of accuracy. Considering that PESNet has only been trained for  $\frac{1}{3}$  of FermiNet's time (see Section 4.1), we are confident that additional optimization would further narrow the gap to FermiNet.

In an additional ablation study, we compare to PESNet without the MetaGNN. While the results in Figure 7 show that the truncated network continuously lowers its energies, it fails to reproduce the same transition barrier and its energies are  $18\mathrm{m}E_{\mathrm{h}}$  worse compared to the full PESNet.

# 4.1 TRAINING TIME

While the previous experiments have shown that our model's accuracy is on par with FermiNet, PESNet's main appeal is its capability to fit multiple geometries simultaneously. Here, we study the

Figure 7: Comparison between the ground and transition states of cyclobutadiene. The top figure shows the total energy plotted in log scale zeroed at  $-154.68E_{\mathrm{h}}$  with light colors for the ground state and darker colors for the transition state. The bottom figure shows the estimate of the transition barrier. Note that both figures use a logarithmic x-axis. All methods estimate the same transition barriers in line with the highest MR-CC results at the upper end of the experimental data. Reference energies are taken from Hermann et al. (2020); Pfau et al. (2020); Shen & Piecuch (2012).

training times for all systems from the previous section. We compare the official JAX implementation of FermiNet (Spencer et al., 2020), the official PyTorch implementation of PauliNet (Hermann et al., 2020), the official TensorFlow implementation of DeepErwin (Scherbela et al., 2021), and our JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) implementation of PESNet. We use the same hyperparameters as in the experiments or the defaults from the respective works. All measurements have been conducted on a machine with 16 AMD EPYC 7543 cores and a single Nvidia A100 GPU. Table 1 shows the GPU hours to train the models of the last section. It is apparent that PESNet used the fewest GPU hours across all systems. Compared to the similar accurate FermiNet, PESNet is up to 47 times faster to train. This speedup is especially noticeable if many configurations shall be evaluated, e.g., 39 nitrogen geometries. Compared to the less accurate PauliNet and DeepErwin, PESNet's speed gain shrinks, but our training times are still consistently lower while achieving significantly better results. Additionally, PESNet is not fitted to the plotted discrete set of configurations but is trained on a continuous subset of the potential energy surface for H4, H10, and N2. Thus, if one is interested in high-resolution potential energy surface scans, PESNet's speedup is growing linearly in the number of configurations. Still, the numbers in this section do not paint a complete picture, thus, we would like to refer the reader to Appendix E and F for additional discussion on training and convergence.

# 5 DISCUSSION

We presented a novel architecture that can simultaneously solve the Schrödinger equation for multiple geometries. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art networks, our PESNet accelerates the training for many configurations by up to 40 times while often achieving better accuracy. The integration of physical symmetries enables us to reduce our training space. Finally, our results show that a single model can capture a continuous subset of the potential energy surface. This acceleration of neural wave functions opens access to accurate quantum mechanical calculations to a broader audience. For instance, it may enable significantly higher-resolution analyses of complex potential energy surfaces with potential applications in generating new datasets with unprecedented accuracy or even integration into molecular dynamics simulations.

Ethics and reproducibility. Advanced computational chemistry tools may have a positive impact in chemistry research, for instance in material discovery. However, they also pose the risk of misuse, e.g., for the development of chemical weapons. To the best of our knowledge, our work does not promote misuse any more than general computational chemistry research. To reduce the likelihood of such misuse, we publish our source code under the Hippocratic license (Ehmke, 2019). To facilitate reproducibility, the source code includes simple scripts to reproduce all experiments from Section 4. Furthermore, we provide a detailed schematic of the computational graph in Figure 2 and additional details on the experimental setup including all hyperparameters in Appendix C.
