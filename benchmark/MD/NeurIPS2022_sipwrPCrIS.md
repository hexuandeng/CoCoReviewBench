# Abstract

We analyze feature learning in infinite width neural networks trained with gradient flow through a self-consistent dynamical field theory. We construct a collection of deterministic dynamical order parameters which are inner-product kernels for hidden unit activations and gradients in each layer at pairs of time points, providing a reduced description of network activity through training. These kernel order parameters collectively define the hidden layer activation distribution, the evolution of the neural tangent kernel, and consequently output predictions. For deep linear networks, these kernels satisfy a set of algebraic matrix equations. For nonlinear networks, we provide an alternating sampling procedure to self-consistently solve for the kernel order parameters. We provide comparisons of the self-consistent solution to various approximation schemes including the static NTK approximation, gradient independence assumption, and leading order perturbation theory, showing that each of these approximations can break down in regimes where general self-consistent solutions still provide an accurate description. Lastly, we provide experiments in more realistic settings which demonstrate that the loss and kernel dynamics of CNNs at fixed feature learning strength is preserved across different widths on a CIFAR classification task.

# 1 Introduction

Deep learning has emerged as a successful paradigm for solving challenging machine learning and computational problems across a variety of domains [1, 2]. However, theoretical understanding of the training and generalization of modern deep learning methods lags behind current practice. Ideally, a theory of deep learning would be analytically tractable, efficiently computable, capable of predicting network performance and internal features that the network learns, and interpretable through a reduced description involving desirably initialization-independent quantities.

Several recent theoretical advances have fruitfully considered the idealization of wide neural networks, where the number of hidden units in each layer is taken to be large. Under certain parameterization, Bayesian neural networks and gradient descent trained networks converge to gaussian processes (NNGPs) [3, 4] and neural tangent kernel (NTK) machines [5-7] in their respective infinite width limits. These limits provide both analytic tractability as well as detailed training and generalization analysis [8-15]. However, in this limit, with these parameterizations, data representations are fixed and do not adapt to data, termed the lazy regime of NN training, to contrast it from the rich regime where NNs significantly alter their internal features while fitting the data [16, 17]. The fact that the representation of data is fixed renders these kernel-based theories incapable of explaining feature learning, an ingredient which is crucial to the success of deep learning in practice [18, 19]. Thus, alternative theories capable of modeling feature learning dynamics are needed.

In this work, we attempt to take a step closer towards an ideal theory by deriving an exact analytical description of feature learning NNs at infinite width, but parameterized differently [20-22], in terms of a collection of deterministic dynamical features and gradient kernels. We show that these kernels fully determine the distribution of any network observable. Our results thus provide a bridge between the kernel-centric philosophy of the lazy limit and the rich regime of feature learning, and are predictive of the dynamics of wide but finite networks in the feature learning regime.

Our contributions in this paper are the following:

1. We develop a path integral formulation of gradient flow dynamics in infinite width networks in the feature learning regime. Our parameterization allows interpolation between rich and lazy regimes.  
2. From this path integral formulation, we identify a set of deterministic order parameters, which are feature and gradient kernels at each layer. We show that these order parameters are sufficient to define the distribution of hidden activations at any time of network training.  
3. We identify a set of self-consistency criteria that the kernels satisfy at infinite width which relate these stochastic processes to the kernels and vice versa. For deep linear networks, the self-consistency conditions form a closed set of algebraic matrix equations. For nonlinear networks, we provide a numerical procedure to solve the field theory self-consistently.  
4. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that solutions to these self-consistency equations are predictive of network training at a variety of feature learning strengths, widths and depths. We provide comparisons of our theory to various approximate methods, such as perturbation theory.

# 1.1 Related Works

A natural extension to the lazy NTK/NNGP limit that allows the study of feature learning is to calculate finite width corrections to the infinite width limit. Finite width corrections to Bayesian inference in wide networks have been obtained with various perturbative [23-27] and self-consistent techniques [28-31]. In the gradient descent based setting, leading order corrections to the NTK dynamics have been analyzed to study finite width effects [32-34, 26]. These methods give approximate corrections which are accurate provided the strength of feature learning is small. In very rich feature learning regimes, however, the corrections can give incorrect predictions [35, 36].

Another approach to study feature learning is to alter NN parameterization in gradient-based learning to allow significant feature evolution even at infinite width, the mean field limit [20, 37]. Works on mean field NNs have yielded formal loss convergence results [38, 39] and shown equivalences of gradient flow dynamics to a partial differential equation (PDE) [40-42], however computation of the PDE for deep networks is often computationally expensive compared to the kernel limit. In a related approach, a set of recent works have demonstrated equivalence between one-pass stochastic gradient descent with mean field parameterization and a hierarchical stochastic process which can be computed efficiently [22, 43], enabling theoretical solutions to practical issues such as hyper-parameter search and transfer [44]. This stochastic process gave a simplification of training dynamics, but was not further reduced to a description involving small number of initialization independent kernels. Further, in the one pass setting, each sample and its representation is seen only once rather than computed throughout training, prohibiting tracking the full kernel through time.

Our theory is inspired by self-consistent dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) from statistical physics [45-51]. This framework has been utilized in the theory of random recurrent networks [52-56], tensor PCA [57, 58], phase retrieval [59], and high-dimensional linear classifiers [60-63], but has yet to be developed for deep feature learning. By developing a self-consistent DMFT of deep NNs, we gain insight into how features evolve in the rich regime of network training, while retaining many pleasant analytic properties of the infinite width limit.

# 2 Problem Setup and Definitions

Our theory applies to infinite width networks, both fully-connected and convolutional. For notational ease we will relegate convolutional results to later sections. For input  $\pmb{x}_{\mu} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ , we define the hidden pre-activation vectors  $\pmb{h}^{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$  for layers  $\ell \in \{1, \dots, L\}$  as

$$
f _ {\mu} = \frac {1}{\gamma \sqrt {N}} \boldsymbol {w} ^ {L} \cdot \phi \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\mu} ^ {L}\right), \quad \boldsymbol {h} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell + 1} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {N}} \boldsymbol {W} ^ {\ell} \phi \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell}\right), \quad \boldsymbol {h} _ {\mu} ^ {1} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {D}} \boldsymbol {W} ^ {0} \boldsymbol {x} _ {\mu}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $\pmb{\theta} = \mathrm{Vec}\{\pmb{W}^0, \dots, \pmb{w}^L\}$  are the trainable parameters of the network and  $\phi$  is a twice differentiable activation function. Inspired by previous works on the mechanisms of lazy gradient based training, the parameter  $\gamma$  will control the laziness or richness of the training dynamics [16, 17, 22, 40]. Each of the trainable parameters are initialized as Gaussian random variables with unit variance  $W_{ij}^{\ell} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . They evolve under gradient flow  $\frac{d}{dt}\pmb{\theta} = -\gamma^{2}\nabla_{\pmb{\theta}}\mathcal{L}$ . The choice of learning rate  $\gamma^2$  causes  $\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal{L}|_{t=0}$  to be independent of  $\gamma$ . To characterize the evolution of weights, we introduce backpropagation variables  $\pmb{g}_{\mu}^{\ell} = \gamma \sqrt{N} \frac{\partial f_{\mu}}{\partial h_{\mu}^{\ell}} = \dot{\phi}(\pmb{h}_{\mu}^{\ell}) \odot \pmb{z}_{\mu}^{\ell}$ , where  $\pmb{z}_{\mu}^{\ell} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \pmb{W}^{\ell \top} \pmb{g}_{\mu}^{\ell+1}$  is the pre-gradient signal.

The relevant dynamical objects to characterize feature learning are feature and gradient kernels for each hidden layer  $\ell \in \{1,\dots,L\}$ , defined as

$$
\Phi_ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) = \frac {1}{N} \phi \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t)\right) \cdot \phi \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\nu} ^ {\ell} (s)\right), \quad G _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) = \frac {1}{N} \boldsymbol {g} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) \cdot \boldsymbol {g} _ {\alpha} ^ {\ell} (s). \tag {2}
$$

From the kernels  $\{\Phi^{\ell}, G^{\ell}\}_{\ell=1}^{L}$ , we can compute the Neural Tangent Kernel  $K_{\mu \alpha}^{NTK}(t, s) = \nabla_{\theta} f_{\mu}(t) \cdot \nabla_{\theta} f_{\alpha}(s) = \sum_{\ell=0}^{L} G_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell+1}(t, s) \Phi_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell}(t, s)$ , and the dynamics of the network function  $f_{\mu}$

$$
\frac {d}{d t} f _ {\mu} (t) = \sum_ {\alpha = 1} ^ {P} K _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {N T K} (t, t) \Delta_ {\alpha} (t), \quad \Delta_ {\mu} (t) = - \frac {\partial}{\partial f _ {\mu}} \mathcal {L} | _ {f _ {\mu} (t)}, \tag {3}
$$

where we define base cases  $G_{\mu \alpha}^{L + 1}(t,s) = 1, \Phi_{\mu \alpha}^0 (t,s) = K_{\mu \alpha}^x = \frac{1}{D}\pmb{x}_\mu \cdot \pmb{x}_\alpha$ . We note that the above formula holds for any data point  $\mu$  which may or may not be in the set of  $P$  training examples. The above expressions demonstrate that knowledge of the temporal trajectory of the NTK on the  $t = s$  diagonal gives the temporal trajectory of the network predictions  $f_{\mu}(t)$ .

Following prior works on infinite width networks [20, 22, 38, 17], we study the mean field limit

$$
N, \gamma \rightarrow \infty , \quad \gamma_ {0} = \frac {\gamma}{\sqrt {N}} = \mathcal {O} _ {N} (1). \tag {4}
$$

As we demonstrate in the Appendix D and L, this is the only scaling which allows feature learning as  $N\to \infty$ . The  $\gamma_0 = 0$  limit recovers the static NTK limit [5]. We discuss other scalings and parameterizations in Appendix L, relating our work to the  $\mu P$ -parameterization of [22] and showing these parameterizations give identical feature dynamics in the infinite width limit. We also analyze the effect of different hidden layer widths and initialization variances in the Appendix D.7. We focus on equal widths and NTK parameterization (as in eq. (1)) in the main text to reduce complexity.

# 3 Self-consistent DMFT

Next, we derive our self-consistent DMFT. Our goal is to build a description of training dynamics purely based on representations, and independent of weights. Studying feature learning at infinite width enjoys several analytical properties:

- The kernel order parameters  $\Phi^{\ell}, G^{\ell}$  concentrate over random initializations but are dynamical, allowing flexible adaptation of features to the task structure.  
- In each layer  $\ell$ , each neuron's preactivation  $h_i^\ell$  and pregradient  $z_i^\ell$  become i.i.d. draws from a distribution characterized by a set of order parameters  $\{\Phi^\ell, G^\ell, A^\ell, B^\ell\}$ .  
- The kernels are defined as self-consistent averages (denoted by  $\langle \rangle$ ) over this distribution of neurons in each layer  $\Phi_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell}(t,s) = \left\langle \phi(h_{\mu}^{\ell}(t))\phi(h_{\alpha}^{\ell}(s))\right\rangle$  and  $G_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell}(t,s) = \left\langle g_{\mu}^{\ell}(t)g_{\alpha}^{\ell}(s)\right\rangle$ .

The next section derives these facts from a path-integral formulation of gradient flow dynamics.

# 3.1 Path Integral Construction

Gradient flow after a random initialization of weights defines a high dimensional stochastic process over initializations for variables  $\{h, g\}$ . Therefore, we will utilize DMFT formalism to obtain a reduced description of network activity during training. We separate the contribution on each forward/backward pass between the initial condition and gradient updates to weight matrix  $W^{\ell}$ , defining new stochastic variables  $\boldsymbol{\chi}^{\ell}, \boldsymbol{\xi}^{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$  as

$$
\chi_ {\mu} ^ {\ell + 1} (t) = \frac {1}{\sqrt {N}} \boldsymbol {W} ^ {\ell} (0) \phi \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t)\right), \quad \boldsymbol {\xi} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) = \frac {1}{\sqrt {N}} \boldsymbol {W} ^ {\ell} (0) ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {g} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell + 1} (t). \tag {5}
$$

We let  $Z$  represent the moment generating functional (MGF) for these stochastic fields

$$
Z [ \{\boldsymbol {j} ^ {\ell}, \boldsymbol {v} ^ {\ell} \} ] = \left\langle \exp \left(\sum_ {\ell , \mu} \int_ {0} ^ {\infty} d t \left[ \boldsymbol {j} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) \cdot \boldsymbol {\chi} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) + \boldsymbol {v} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) \cdot \boldsymbol {\xi} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) \right]\right) \right\rangle_ {\{\boldsymbol {W} ^ {0} (0), \dots \boldsymbol {w} ^ {L} (0) \}},
$$

which requires, by construction the normalization condition  $Z[\{\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{0}\}] = 1$ . We enforce our definition of  $\chi, \xi$  using an integral representation of the delta-function. Thus for each sample  $\mu \in [P]$  and each time  $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$ , we multiply  $Z$  by

$$
1 = \int_ {\mathbb {R} ^ {N}} \int_ {\mathbb {R} ^ {N}} \frac {d \boldsymbol {\chi} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell + 1} (t) d \hat {\boldsymbol {\chi}} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell + 1} (t)}{(2 \pi) ^ {N}} \exp \left(i \hat {\boldsymbol {\chi}} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell + 1} (t) \cdot \left[ \boldsymbol {\chi} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell + 1} (t) - \frac {1}{\sqrt {N}} \boldsymbol {W} ^ {\ell} (0) \phi (\boldsymbol {h} _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t)) \right]\right), \tag {6}
$$

for  $\chi$  and the respective expression for  $\xi$ . After making such substitutions, we perform integration over initial Gaussian weight matrices to arrive at an integral expression for  $Z$ , which we derive in the appendix D.3. We show that  $Z$  can be described by set of order-parameters  $\{\Phi^{\ell}, \hat{\Phi}^{\ell}, G^{\ell}, \hat{G}^{\ell}, A^{\ell}, B^{\ell}\}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} Z [ \{\boldsymbol {j} ^ {\ell}, \boldsymbol {v} ^ {\ell} \} ] \propto \int \prod_ {\ell \mu \alpha t s} d \Phi_ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) d \hat {\Phi} _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) d G _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) d \hat {G} _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) d A _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) d B _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) (7) \\ \times \exp \left(N S [ \{\Phi , \hat {\Phi}, G, \hat {G}, A, B, j, v \} ]\right), \\ S = \sum_ {\ell \mu \alpha} \int_ {0} ^ {\infty} d t \int_ {0} ^ {\infty} d s \left[ \Phi_ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) \hat {\Phi} _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) + G _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) \hat {G} _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) - A _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) B _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) \right] \\ + \ln \mathcal {Z} [ \{\Phi , \hat {\Phi}, G, \hat {G}, A, B, j, v \} ], (8) \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathcal{Z}$  is a single-site MGF, which defines the distribution of fields  $\{\chi^{\ell},\xi^{\ell}\}$  over the neural population in each layer. The kernels  $A$  and  $B$  are related to the correlations between feedforward and feedback signals in the network. We provide a detailed formula for  $\mathcal{Z}$  in the Appendix D.3 and show that it factorizes over different layers  $\mathcal{Z} = \prod_{\ell = 1}^{L}\mathcal{Z}_{\ell}$ .

# 3.2 Deriving the DMFT Equations from the Path Integral Saddle Point

As  $N\to \infty$  , the moment-generating function  $Z$  is exponentially dominated by the saddle point of  $S$  The equations that define this saddle point also define our DMFT. We thus identify the kernels that render  $S$  locally stationary. The most important equations are those which define  $\{\Phi^{\ell},G^{\ell}\}$

$$
\frac {\delta S}{\delta \hat {\Phi} _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t , s)} = \Phi_ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) + \frac {1}{\mathcal {Z}} \frac {\delta \mathcal {Z}}{\delta \hat {\Phi} _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t , s)} = \Phi_ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) - \left\langle \phi (h _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t)) \phi (h _ {\alpha} ^ {\ell} (s)) \right\rangle = 0,
$$

$$
\frac {\delta S}{\delta \hat {G} _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t , s)} = G _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) + \frac {1}{\mathcal {Z}} \frac {\delta \mathcal {Z}}{\delta \hat {G} _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t , s)} = G _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) - \left\langle g _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) g _ {\alpha} ^ {\ell} (s) \right\rangle = 0, \tag {9}
$$

where  $\langle \rangle$  denotes an average over the stochastic process induced by  $\mathcal{Z}$ , which is defined below

$$
\left\{u _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) \right\} _ {\mu \in [ P ], t \in \mathbb {R} _ {+}} \sim \mathcal {G P} \left(0, \boldsymbol {\Phi} ^ {\ell - 1}\right), \left\{r _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) \right\} _ {\mu \in [ P ], t \in \mathbb {R} _ {+}} \sim \mathcal {G P} \left(0, \boldsymbol {G} ^ {\ell + 1}\right),
$$

$$
h _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) = u _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) + \gamma_ {0} \int_ {0} ^ {\infty} d s \sum_ {\alpha = 1} ^ {P} \left[ A _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell - 1} (t, s) + \Theta (t - s) \Delta_ {\alpha} (s) \Phi_ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell - 1} (t, s) \right] z _ {\alpha} ^ {\ell} (s) \dot {\phi} (h _ {\alpha} ^ {\ell} (s)),
$$

$$
z _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) = r _ {\mu} ^ {\ell} (t) + \gamma_ {0} \int_ {0} ^ {\infty} d s \sum_ {\alpha = 1} ^ {P} \left[ B _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell} (t, s) + \Theta (t - s) \Delta_ {\alpha} (s) G _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {\ell + 1} (t, s) \right] \phi \left(h _ {\alpha} ^ {\ell} (s)\right), \tag {10}
$$

where we define base cases  $\Phi_{\mu \alpha}^{0}(t,s) = K_{\mu \alpha}^{x}$  and  $G_{\mu \alpha}^{L + 1}(t,s) = 1$ ,  $A^0 = B^L = 0$ . We see that the fields  $\{h^\ell, z^\ell\}$ , which represent the single site preactivations and pre-gradients, are implicit functionals of the mean-zero Gaussian processes  $\{u^\ell, r^\ell\}$  which have covariances  $\left\langle u_\mu^\ell(t)u_\alpha^\ell(s)\right\rangle = \Phi_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell - 1}(t,s)$  and  $\left\langle r_\mu^\ell(t)r_\alpha^\ell(s)\right\rangle = G_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell + 1}(t,s)$ . The other saddle point equations give  $A_{\mu \alpha}^\ell(t,s) = \gamma_0^{-1}\left\langle \frac{\delta\phi(h_\mu^\ell(t))}{\delta r_\alpha^\ell(s)}\right\rangle, B_{\mu \alpha}^\ell(t,s) = \gamma_0^{-1}\left\langle \frac{\delta g_\mu^{\ell + 1}(t)}{\delta u_\alpha^{\ell + 1}(s)}\right\rangle$  which arise due to coupling between

This theory is easily extended to more general architectures such as networks with varying widths by layer (App. D.7), trainable bias parameter (App. H), multiple (but  $\mathcal{O}_N(1)$ ) output channels (App. I), convolutional architectures (App. G), networks trained with momentum (App. J), discrete time training (App. K), and alternative parameterization schemes (App. L), showing our setup is equivalent to the  $\mu P$  scheme of [22, 43]. Though prior  $\mu P$  analyses focus on one-pass training, our field theory accommodates batch training on  $P$  examples to capture how kernels evolve in time.

# 4 Solving the Self-Consistent DMFT

The saddle point equations obtained from the field theory discussed in the previous section must be solved self-consistently. By this we mean that, given knowledge of the kernels, we can characterize the

distribution of  $\{h^{\ell},z^{\ell}\}$ , and given the distribution of  $\{h^{\ell},z^{\ell}\}$ , we can compute the kernels [64, 61]. In the Appendix B we provide Algorithm a numerical procedure based on this idea to efficiently solve for the kernels with an alternating Monte-Carlo strategy. The output of the algorithm are the dynamical kernels  $\Phi_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell}(t,s),G_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell}(t,s),A_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell}(t,s),B_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell}(t,s)$  from which any network observable can be computed as we discuss in Appendix D. We provide an example of the solution to the saddle point equations compared to training a finite NN in Figure 1. We plot  $\Phi^{\ell},G^{\ell}$  at the end of training and the sample-trace of these kernels through time. Additionally, we compare the kernels of finite width  $N$  network to the DMFT predicted kernels using a cosine-similarity alignment metric  $A(\Phi^{DMFT},\Phi^{NN}) = \frac{\mathrm{Tr}\Phi^{DMFT}\Phi^{NN}}{|\Phi^{DMFT}||\Phi^{NN}|}$ . Additional examples are in Appendix Figures 5 and Figure 6.

# 4.1 Deep Linear Networks: Closed Form Self-Consistent Equations

Deep linear networks  $(\phi(h) = h)$  are of theoretical interest since they are simpler to analyze than nonlinear networks but preserve non-trivial training dynamics and feature learning [65-69, 25, 30, 23]. In a deep linear network, we can simplify our saddle point equations to algebraic formulas that close in terms of the kernels  $H_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell}(t,s) = \langle h_{\mu}^{\ell}(t)h_{\alpha}^{\ell}(s)\rangle$ ,  $G^{\ell}(t,s) = \langle g^{\ell}(t)g^{\ell}(s)\rangle$ . This is a significant simplification since it allows solution of the saddle point equations without a sampling procedure.

To describe the result, we first introduce a vectorization notation  $\pmb{h}^{\ell} = \mathrm{Vec}\{h_{\mu}^{\ell}(t)\}_{\mu \in [P], t \in \mathbb{R}_{+}}$ . Likewise we convert kernels  $H^{\ell} = \mathrm{Mat}\{H_{\mu \alpha}^{\ell}(t,s)\}_{\mu ,\alpha \in [P], t,s \in \mathbb{R}_{+}}$  into matrices. The inner product under this vectorization is defined as  $\pmb{a} \cdot \pmb{b} = \int_0^\infty dt \sum_{\mu=1}^P a_\mu(t)b_\mu(t)$ . In a practical computational implementation, the theory would be evaluated on a grid of  $T$  time points with discrete time gradient descent, so these kernels  $H^{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{PT \times PT}$  would indeed be matrices of the appropriate size. We can write the following algebraic expressions for fields  $h^{\ell}, g^{\ell}$  in terms of independent Gaussian processes  $\pmb{u}^{\ell}, \pmb{r}^{\ell}$  which have covariances  $H^{\ell-1}$  and  $G^{\ell+1}$  respectively

$$
\left(\mathbf {I} - \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} C ^ {\ell} D ^ {\ell}\right) h ^ {\ell} = \boldsymbol {u} ^ {\ell} + \gamma_ {0} C ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {r} ^ {\ell}, \left(\mathbf {I} - \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} D ^ {\ell} C ^ {\ell}\right) \boldsymbol {g} ^ {\ell} = \boldsymbol {r} ^ {\ell} + \gamma_ {0} D ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {u} ^ {\ell}. \tag {11}
$$

The matrices  $C^\ell$  and  $D^\ell$  are causal integral operators which depend on  $\{A^{\ell -1},H^{\ell -1}\}$  and  $\{B^{\ell},G^{\ell +1}\}$  respectively which we define in Appendix F. We see that the  $h,g$  fields are Gaussian in the linear network, not just at initialization, but throughout training. The saddle point equations which define the kernels in terms of two point correlators are

$$
\boldsymbol {H} ^ {\ell} = \left\langle \boldsymbol {h} ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {h} ^ {\ell \top} \right\rangle = \left(\mathbf {I} - \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {C} ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {D} ^ {\ell}\right) ^ {- 1} \left[ \boldsymbol {H} ^ {\ell - 1} + \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {C} ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {G} ^ {\ell + 1} \boldsymbol {C} ^ {\ell \top} \right] \left[ \left(\mathbf {I} - \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {C} ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {D} ^ {\ell}\right) ^ {- 1} \right] ^ {\top}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {G} ^ {\ell} = \left\langle \boldsymbol {g} ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {g} ^ {\ell \top} \right\rangle = \left(\mathbf {I} - \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {D} ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {C} ^ {\ell}\right) ^ {- 1} \left[ \boldsymbol {G} ^ {\ell + 1} + \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {D} ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {H} ^ {\ell - 1} \boldsymbol {D} ^ {\ell \top} \right] \left[ \left(\mathbf {I} - \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {D} ^ {\ell} \boldsymbol {C} ^ {\ell}\right) ^ {- 1} \right] ^ {\top}. \tag {12}
$$

Examples of the predictions obtained by solving these systems of equations are provided in Figure 2. We see that these DMFT equations describe kernel evolution for networks of a variety of depths and that the change in each layer's kernel increases with the depth of the network. We note the inverse  $\left(\mathbf{I} - \gamma_0^2 C^\ell D^\ell\right)^{-1}$ , when viewed as a function of  $\gamma_0^2$  has simple poles at the reciprocal singular values of  $C^\ell D^\ell$ , which suggests the existence of a maximal stable  $\gamma_0$ . In experiments we have observed kernels diverging for sufficiently large  $\gamma_0$ , but leave in-depth analysis of this to future work.

Unlike many prior results [65-68], our DMFT does not require any restrictions on the structure of the input data but hold for any  $K^x, y$ . However, for whitened data  $K^x = \mathbf{I}$  we show in Appendix F.1.1 that our DMFT learning curves interpolate between NTK dynamics and the sigmoidal trajectories of prior works [65, 66] as  $\gamma_0$  is increased. For example, in the two layer  $(L = 1)$  linear network with  $K^x = \mathbf{I}$ , the dynamics of the error norm  $\Delta(t) = ||\Delta(t)||$  takes the form  $\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Delta(t) = -\sqrt{1 + \gamma_0^2(y - \Delta(t))^2} \Delta(t)$  where  $y = ||y||$ . These dynamics give the linear convergence rate of the NTK if  $\gamma_0 \to 0$  but approaches logistic dynamics of [66] as  $\gamma_0 \to \infty$ . Further,  $H(t) = \langle h^1(t) h^1(t)^{\top} \rangle \in \mathbb{R}^{P \times P}$  only grows in the  $yy^\top$  direction with  $H_y(t) = \frac{1}{y^2} y^\top H(t) y = \sqrt{1 + \gamma_0^2(y - \Delta(t))^2}$ . At the end of training  $H(t) \to \mathbf{I} + \frac{1}{y^2} [\sqrt{1 + \gamma_0^2 y^2} - 1] y y^\top$ , recovering the rank one spike which was recently obtained in the small initialization limit [?].

# 5 Approximation Schemes

We now compare our exact DMFT with approximations of prior works, providing an explanation of when these approximations give accurate predictions and when they break down.

# 5.1 Gradient Independence Ansatz

We can study the accuracy of the ansatz  $A^\ell = B^\ell = 0$ , which is equivalent to treating the weight matrices  $\boldsymbol{W}^{\ell}(0)$  and  $\boldsymbol{W}^{\ell}(0)^{\top}$  which appear in forward and backward passes respectively as independent Gaussian matrices. This assumption was utilized in prior works on signal propagation in deep networks in the lazy regime [70-74]. A consequence of this approximation is the Gaussianity and statistical independence of  $\chi^{\ell}$  and  $\xi^{\ell}$  (conditional on  $\{\Phi^{\ell}, G^{\ell}\}$ ) in each layer as we show in Appendix M. This ansatz works very well near  $\gamma_0 \approx 0$  (the static kernel regime) since  $\frac{dh}{dr}$ ,  $\frac{dz}{du} \sim \mathcal{O}(\gamma_0)$  or around initialization  $t \approx 0$  but begins to fail at larger values of  $\gamma_0$ ,  $t$  (Figure 3).

# 5.2 Perturbation theory in  $\gamma_0$  at Infinite Width

In the  $\gamma_0\to 0$  limit, we recover static kernels, giving linear dynamics identical to the NTK limit [5]. Corrections to this lazy limit can be extracted at small but finite  $\gamma_0$ . This is conceptually similar to recent works which consider perturbation series for the NTK in powers of  $1 / N$  [33, 26, 27] (though not identical, see Appendix N.7). We expand all observables  $q(\gamma_0)$  in a power series in  $\gamma_0$ , giving  $q(\gamma_0) = q^{(0)} + \gamma_0q^{(1)} + \gamma_0^2q^{(2)} + \ldots$  and compute corrections up to  $\mathcal{O}(\gamma_0^2)$ . We show that the  $\mathcal{O}(\gamma_0)$  and  $\mathcal{O}(\gamma_0^3)$  corrections to kernels vanish, giving leading order expansions of the form  $\Phi = \Phi^0 +\gamma_0^2\Phi^2 +\mathcal{O}(\gamma_0^4)$  and  $\pmb {G} = \pmb {G}^0 +\gamma_0^2\pmb {G}^2 +\mathcal{O}(\gamma_0^4)$  (see Appendix N.2). Further, we show that the NTK has relative change at leading order which scales linearly with depth  $|\Delta K^{NTK}| / |K^{NTK,0}|\sim \mathcal{O}_{\gamma ,L}(L\gamma_0^2) = \mathcal{O}_{N,\gamma ,L}(\frac{\gamma^2L}{N})$ , which is consistent with finite width effective field theory at  $\gamma = \mathcal{O}_N(1)$  [26, 27] (Appendix N.6). Further, at the leading order correction, all temporal dependencies are controlled by  $P(P + 1)$  functions  $v_{\alpha}(t) = \int_{0}^{t}ds\Delta_{\alpha}^{0}(s)$  and  $v_{\alpha \beta}(t) = \int_{0}^{t}ds\Delta_{\alpha}^{0}(s)\int_{0}^{s}ds'\Delta_{\beta}^{0}(s')$ , which is consistent with those derived for finite width NNs using a truncation of the Neural Tangent Hierarchy [32, 33, 26]. To lighten notation, we focus our main

Using the timescales derived in the previous section, we find that the leading order correction to the kernels in infinite width deep linear network have the form

$$
\begin{array}{l} K _ {\mu \nu} ^ {N T K} (t, s) = (L + 1) K _ {\mu \nu} ^ {x} + \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} \frac {L (L + 1)}{2} K _ {\mu \nu} ^ {x} \sum_ {\alpha \beta} K _ {\alpha \beta} ^ {x} [ v _ {\alpha \beta} (t) + v _ {\beta \alpha} (s) + v _ {\alpha} (t) v _ {\beta} (s) ] \\ + \gamma_ {0} ^ {2} \frac {L (L + 1)}{2} \left[ \sum_ {\alpha \beta} K _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {x} K _ {\nu \beta} ^ {x} \left[ v _ {\alpha \beta} (t) + v _ {\beta \alpha} (s) \right] + \sum_ {\alpha \beta} K _ {\mu \alpha} ^ {x} K _ {\nu \beta} ^ {x} v _ {\alpha} (t) v _ {\beta} (s) \right] + \mathcal {O} \left(\gamma_ {0} ^ {4}\right). \tag {13} \\ \end{array}
$$

We see that the relative change in the NTK  $|\pmb{K}^{NTK} - \pmb{K}^{NTK}(0)| / |\pmb{K}^{NTK}(0)|\sim \mathcal{O}(\gamma_0^2 L) = \mathcal{O}(\gamma^2 L / N)$ , so that large depth  $L$  networks exhibit more significant kernel evolution, which agrees with other perturbative studies [33, 26, 25] as well as the non-perturbative results in Figure 2. However at large  $\gamma_0$  and large  $L$ , this theory begins to break down as we show in Figure 3

# 6 Feature Learning Dynamics is Preserved at Fixed  $\gamma_0$

Our DMFT suggests that for networks sufficiently wide for their kernels to concentrate, the dynamics of loss and kernels should be invariant under the rescaling  $N \to RN$ ,  $\gamma \to \gamma / \sqrt{R}$ , which keeps  $\gamma_0$  fixed. To evaluate how well this idea holds in a realistic deep learning problem, we trained CNNs of varying channel counts  $N$  on two-class CIFAR classification [75]. We tracked the dynamics of

the loss and the last layer  $\Phi^L$  kernel. The results are provided in Figure 4. We see that dynamics are largely independent of rescaling as predicted. Further, as expected, larger  $\gamma_0$  leads to larger changes in kernel norm and faster alignment to the target function  $y$ , as was also found in [76]. Consequently, the higher  $\gamma_0$  networks train more rapidly. The trend is consistent for width  $N = 250$  and  $N = 500$ . More details about the experiment can be found in Appendix C.2.

# 7 Discussion

In this work, we provided a unifying DMFT for feature learning in infinite networks trained with gradient based training. This theory smoothly interpolates between lazy infinite width behavior of a static NTK in  $\gamma_0\rightarrow 0$  and rich feature learning. At infinite width, each neuron's pre-activation and pre-gradient (or each channel in a CNN) is independent and identically distributed throughout training and the kernels in each layer can be computed from averages over the distribution of neurons. The saddle point equations for kernels are exactly solvable in deep linear networks and can be solved numerically method in the nonlinear case. Experimental comparisons with other approximation methods such as gradient independence and perturbation theory, show that DMFT can be accurate at a much wider range of  $\gamma_0$ . We believe this framework could be a useful starting point for future theoretical analyses of feature learning and generalization in wide networks.

Though our self-consistent DMFT is quite general in regards to the data, architecture and nonlinearity, a limitation is that it is still computationally expensive to evaluate. In Table [1] we compare the time taken for various theories to compute the feature kernels throughout  $T$  steps of gradient descent. For a width  $N$  network, computation of each forward pass on all  $P$  data points takes  $\mathcal{O}(PN^2)$  computations. The static NTK requires computation of  $\mathcal{O}(P^2)$  entries in the kernel which do not need to be recomputed. However, the DMFT requires matrix multiplications on  $PT \times PT$  matrices giving a  $\mathcal{O}(P^3 T^3)$  time scaling. Future work could aim to improve the computational overhead of the algorithm, by considering data averaged theories [61] or one pass SGD [22].

Table 1: Computational requirements to compute kernel dynamics and trained network predictions on  $P$  points in a depth  $N$  neural network on a grid of  $T$  time points trained with  $P$  data points for various theories. DMFT is faster and less memory intensive than a width  $N$  network only if  $N \gg PT$ . It is more computationally efficient to compute full DMFT kernels than leading order perturbation theory when  $T \ll \sqrt{P}$ . The expensive scaling with both samples and time are the cost of a full-batch non-perturbative theory of feature learning.
