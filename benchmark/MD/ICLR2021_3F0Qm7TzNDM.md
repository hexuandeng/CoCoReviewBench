# ABSTRACT

In the context of supervised learning of a function by a Neural Network (NN), we claim and empirically justify that a NN yields better results when the distribution of the data set focuses on regions where the function to learn is steeper. We first traduce this assumption in a mathematically workable way using Taylor expansion. Then, theoretical derivations allow to construct a methodology that we call Variance Based Samples Weighting (VBSW). VBSW uses local variance of the labels to weight the training points. This methodology is general, scalable, cost effective, and significantly increases the performances of a large class of models for various classification and regression tasks on image, text and multivariate data. We highlight its benefits with experiments involving NNs from shallow linear NN to ResNet (He et al., 2015) or Bert (Devlin et al., 2019).

# 1 INTRODUCTION

When a Machine Learning (ML) model is used to learn from data, the distribution of the training data set can have a strong impact on its performances. More specifically, in the context of Deep Learning (DL), several works have hinted at the importance of the training set. In Bengio et al. (2009); Matiisen et al. (2017), the authors exploit the observation that a human will benefit more from easy examples than from harder ones at the beginning of a learning task. They construct a curriculum, inducing a change in the distribution of the training data set that will make a Neural Network (NN) achieve better results in an ML problem. With a different approach, Active Learning (Settles, 2012) modifies dynamically the distribution of the training data, by selecting the data points that will make the training more efficient. Finally, in Reinforcement Learning, the distribution of experiments is crucial for the agent to learn efficiently. Nonetheless, the challenge of finding a good distribution is not specific to ML. Indeed, in the context of Monte Carlo estimation of a quantity of interest based on a random variable  $X \sim d\mathbb{P}_X$ , Importance Sampling owes its efficiency to the construction of a second random variable,  $\bar{X} \sim d\mathbb{P}_{\bar{X}}$  that will be used instead of  $X$  to improve the estimation of this quantity. Jie & Abbeel (2010) even make a connection between the success of likelihood ratio policy gradients and importance sampling, which shows that ML and Monte Carlo estimation, so distribution based methods, are closely linked.

In this paper, we leverage the importance of the training set distribution to improve performances of NNs in supervised ML. This task can be formalized as approximating a function  $f$  with a model  $f_{\theta}$  parametrized by  $\theta$ . We build a new distribution from the training points and their labels, based on the observation that a model  $f_{\theta}$  needs more data points to approximate  $f$  on the regions where it is steep. We use Taylor expansion of a function  $f$ , which links the local behaviour of  $f$  to its derivatives, to build this distribution. We show that up to a certain order and locally, variance is an estimator of Taylor expansion. It allows constructing a methodology, Variance Based Sample Weighting (VBSW) that weights each training data points using the local variance of their neighbor labels, prior to the training and regardless of the model, to simulate the new distribution. Sample weighting has already been explored in many works and for various goals. Kumar et al. (2010); Jiang et al. (2015) use it to prioritize easier samples for the training, Shrivastava et al. (2016) for hard example mining, Cui et al. (2019) to avoid class imbalance, or (Liu & Tao, 2016) to solve noisy label problem. Here, the weights' construction relies on a more general claim that can be applied to any data set and whose goal is to boost the performances of the model.

VBSW is general, because it can be applied to any supervised ML problem that involves a loss function. It is made scalable and cost effective, specifically for DL, by applying it within the feature space of NNs. We validate VBSW on various tasks like classification or regression of text, from Glue benchmark (Wang et al., 2019), image, from MNIST (LeCun & Cortes, 2010) and Cifar10 (Krizhevsky et al.) and multivariate data, from UCI ML repository (Dua & Graff, 2017), for several models ranging from linear regression to Bert (Devlin et al., 2019) or ResNet20 (He et al., 2015). As a highlight, we obtain up to  $1.65\%$  classification improvement on Cifar10 with a ResNet.

Contributions: (i) We present and investigate a new approach of the learning problem, based the variations of the function  $f$  to learn. (ii) We construct a new simple, scalable and cost effective methodology, VBSW, that allows to exploit these findings in order to boost the performances of a NN. (iii) We validate VBSW on various ML tasks.

# 2 RELATED WORKS

Active Learning - Our methodology is based on the consideration that not every sample bring the same amount of information. Active learning (AL) exploits the same idea, in the sense that it adapts the training strategy to the problem by introducing a data point selection rule. In (Gal et al., 2017), the authors introduce a methodology based on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) to adapt the selection of points used for the training. Using the variational properties of BNN, they design a rule to focus the training on points that will reduce the prediction uncertainty of the NN. In (Konyushkova et al., 2017), the construction of the selection rule is taken as a ML problem itself. See (Settles, 2012) for a review of more classical AL methods. The similarity between AL and VBSW goes beyond adapting the training to the data. Indeed, AL selects the data points, so modifies the distribution of the initial training data set. The main difference is that VBSW is prior to the training, and therefore the distribution of the weights can not change throughout the training. Our methodology could even be applied before the training and AL used during the training.

Examples Weighting - VBSW can be categorized as an example weighting algorithm. The idea of weighting the data set has already been explored in different ways and for different purposes. While curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009; Matisen et al., 2017) starts the training with easier examples, Self paced learning (Kumar et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2015) downscales harder examples. However, some works have proven that focusing on harder examples from the beginning of the learning could lead to faster training. In (Shrivastava et al., 2016), hard example mining is performed to give more importance to harder examples by selecting them primarily. Example weighting is used in (Cui et al., 2019) to tackle the class imbalance problem by weighting rarer, and so harder examples. At the contrary, in (Liu & Tao, 2016) it is used to solve the noisy label problem by focusing on cleaner, so easier examples. All these ideas show that depending on the application, example weighting can be performed in an opposed manner. Some works aim at moving beyond this opposition by introducing more general methodologies. In (Chang et al., 2017), the authors use the variance of the prediction of each point throughout the training to decide whether it should be weighted or not. A meta learning approach is proposed in (Ren et al., 2018), where the authors choose the weights after an optimization nested in the training. VBSW stands out from the previously mentioned example weighting methods because it is built on a more general claim that a model will simply need more points to learn more complicated functions. Its effect is to boost the performances of a NN, whatever the application is.

Importance Sampling - Some of the previously mentioned methods use importance sampling to design the weights of the data set or to correct the bias induced by the sample selection (Katharopoulos & Fleuret, 2018). Here, we construct a new distribution that could be interpreted as an importance distribution. However, we weight the data points to simulate this distribution, not to correct a bias induced by this distribution.

Generalization Bound - Generalization bound for the learning theory of NN have motivated many works, most of which are reviewed in (Jakubovitz et al., 2018). In Bartlett et al. (1998), Bartlett et al. (2019), the authors focus on VC-dimension, a measure which depends on the number of parameters of NNs. Arora et al. (2018) introduces a compression approach that aims at reducing the number of model parameters to investigate its generalization capacities. PAC-Bayes analysis constructs generalization bounds using a priori and a posteriori distributions over the possible models. It is investigated for example in Neyshabur et al. (2018); Bartlett et al. (2017), and Neyshabur et al.

(2017); Xu & Mannor (2012) links PAC-Bayes theory to the notion of sharpness of a NN, i.e. its robustness to small perturbation. While sharpness of the model is often mentioned in the previous works, our bound includes the derivatives of  $f$ , the function to approximate, which can be seen as its sharpness. Even if it uses elements of previous works, like the Lipschitz constant of  $f_{\theta}$ , our work does not pretend to tighten and improve the already existing generalization bounds, but only emphasizes the intuition that the NN will need more points to capture sharper functions. In a sense, it investigates the robustness to perturbations in the input space, not in the parameter space.

# 3 A NEW TRAINING DISTRIBUTION BASED ON TAYLOR EXPANSION

In this section, we first illustrate why a NN may need more points where  $f$  is steep by deriving a generalization bound that involves the derivatives of  $f$ . Then, using Taylor expansion, we build a new training distribution that improves the performances of a NN on simple functions.

# 3.1 PROBLEM FORMULATION

We formalize the supervised ML task as approximating a function  $f: \mathbf{S} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n_i} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_o}$  with an ML model  $f_{\theta}$  parametrized by  $\theta$ , where  $\mathbf{S}$  is a measured sub-space of  $\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$  depending on the application. To this end, we are given a training data set of  $N$  points,  $\{X_1, \dots, X_N\} \in \mathbf{S}$ , drawn from  $X \sim d\mathbb{P}_X$  and their point-wise values, or labels  $\{f(X_1), \dots, f(X_N)\}$ . Parameters  $\theta$  have to be found in order to minimize an integrated loss function  $J_X(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_X[L(f_{\theta}(X), f(X))]$ , with  $L$  the loss function,  $L: \mathbb{R}^{n_o} \times \mathbb{R}^{n_o} \to \mathbb{R}$ . The data allow estimating  $J_X(\theta)$  by  $\widehat{J_X}(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} L(f_{\theta}(X_i), f(X_i))$  and to use optimization algorithms to find a minimum of  $\widehat{J_X}(\theta)$  w.r.t.  $\theta$ .

# 3.2 INTUITION BEHIND TAYLOR EXPANSION

In the following, we illustrate the intuition with a Generalization Bound (GB) that include the derivatives of  $f$ , provided that these derivatives exist. The goal of the approximation problem is to be able to generalize to points not seen during the training. The generalization error  $\mathcal{J}_X(\theta) = J_X(\theta) - \widehat{J_X}(\theta)$  thus needs to be as small as possible. Let  $S_i$ ,  $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$  be some sub-spaces of  $\mathbf{S}$  such that  $\mathbf{S} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{N} S_i$ ,  $\bigcap_{i=1}^{N} S_i = \emptyset$ , and  $X_i \in S_i$ . Suppose that  $L$  is the squared  $L_2$  error,  $n_i = 1$ ,  $f$  is differentiable and  $f_\theta$  is  $K_\theta$ -Lipschitz. Provided that  $|S_i| < 1$ , we show that

$$
\mathcal {J} _ {X} (\theta) \leq \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \left(| f ^ {\prime} \left(X _ {i}\right) | + K _ {\theta}\right) ^ {2} \frac {\left| S _ {i} \right| ^ {3}}{4} + O \left(\left| S _ {i} \right| ^ {4}\right), \tag {1}
$$

where  $|S_i|$  is the volume of  $S_i$ . The proof can be found in Appendix B. We see that on the regions where  $f^{\prime}(X_i)$  is higher, quantity  $|S_i|$  has a stronger impact on the GB. This idea is illustrated on Figure 1. Then, since  $|S_i|$  can be seen as a metric for the local density of the data set (the smaller  $|S_i|$  is, the denser the data set is), the GB can be reduced more efficiently by adding more points around  $X_i$  in these regions. This bound also involves  $K_{\theta}$ , the Lipschitz constant of the NN, which

![](images/a15a3d7a913b57c475167b52da84c2b80c593f611aea8200a7c12f26012a4186.jpg)  
Figure 1: Illustration of the GB. The maximum error (the GB), at order  $O(|S_i|^4)$ , is obtained by comparing the maximum variations of  $f_{\theta}$ , and the first order approximation of  $f$ , whose trends are given by  $K_{\theta}$  and  $f^{\prime}(X_i)$ . We understand visually that because  $f^{\prime}(X_1)$  and  $f^{\prime}(X_3)$  are higher than  $f^{\prime}(X_2)$ , the GB is improved more efficiently by reducing  $S_1$  and  $S_3$  than  $S_2$ .

has the same impact than  $f^{\prime}(X_i)$ . It also illustrates the link between the Lipschitz constant and the generalization error, which has been pointed out by several works like (Gouk et al., 2018), (Bartlett et al., 2017) and (Qian & Wegman, 2019). Note that equation 1 only gives indications about  $n = 1$ . Indeed, this GB only has illustration purposes, and motivates the metric described in the next section, which is based on Taylor expansion and therefore involves derivatives of order  $n > 1$ .

# 3.3 A TAYLOR EXPANSION BASED METRIC

In this paragraph, we build a metric involving the derivatives of  $f$ . Using the Taylor expansion at order  $n$  on  $f$  and supposing that  $f$  is  $n$  times differentiable (multi index notation):

$$
f (x + \epsilon) _ {\| \epsilon \| \rightarrow 0} = \sum_ {0 \leq | k | \leq n} \epsilon^ {k} \frac {\partial^ {k} f (x)}{k !} + O (\epsilon^ {n}). \quad D f _ {\epsilon} ^ {n} (x) = \sum_ {1 \leq | k | \leq n} \frac {\| \epsilon \| ^ {k} \cdot \| \operatorname {V e c t} (\partial^ {k} f (x)) \|}{k !}. \tag {2}
$$

Quantity  $f(x + \epsilon) - f(x)$  gives an indication on how much  $f$  changes around  $x$ . By neglecting the orders above  $\epsilon^n$ , it is then possible to find the regions of interest by focusing on  $Df_{\epsilon}^{n}$ , given by equation 2, where  $\operatorname{Vect}(\mathbf{X})$  denotes the vectorization of a tensor  $\mathbf{X}$  and  $\| . \|$  the squared  $L_2$  norm. Note that  $Df_{\epsilon}^{n}$  is evaluated using  $\| \partial^k f(x) \|$  instead of  $\partial^k f(x)$  for derivatives not to cancel each other.  $f$  will be steeper and more irregular in the regions where  $x \to Df_{\epsilon}^{n}(x)$  is higher.

To focus the training set on these regions, one can use  $\{Df_{\epsilon}^{n}(X_{1}),\dots,Df_{\epsilon}^{n}(X_{N})\}$  to construct a probability density function (pdf) and sample new data points from it. This sampling is evaluated and validated in Appendix A for conciseness. Based on these experiments, we choose  $n = 2$ , i.e. we use  $\{Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(X_{1}),\dots,Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(X_{N})\}$ . The good results obtained confirm our observation and motivate its application to more complex ML problems.

# 4 VARIANCE BASED SAMPLES WEIGHTING (VBSW)

# 4.1 PRELIMINARIES

The new distribution cannot always be applied as is, because we do not have access to  $f$ . Problem 1:  $\{Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(X_{1}), \dots, Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(X_{N})\}$  cannot be evaluated since it requires to compute the derivatives of  $f$ . Moreover, it assumes that  $f$  is differentiable, which is often not true. **Problem 2:** even if  $\{Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(X_{1}), \dots, Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(X_{N})\}$  could be computed and new points sampled, we could not obtain their labels to complete the training data set.

Problem 1: Unavailability of derivatives To overcome problem 1, we construct a new metric based on statistical estimation. In this paragraph,  $n_i > 1$  but  $n_o = 1$ . The following derivations can be extended to  $n_o > 1$  by applying it to  $f$  element-wise and then taking the sum across the  $n_o$  dimensions. Let  $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\epsilon \mathbb{I}_{n_i})$  with  $\epsilon \in \mathbf{R}^{+}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{n_i}$  the identity matrix of dimension  $n_i$ . We claim that

$$
V a r (f (x + \epsilon)) = D f _ {\epsilon} ^ {2} (x) + O (| \epsilon | _ {2} ^ {3}).
$$

The demonstration can be found in Appendix B. Using the unbiased estimator of variance, we define new indices  $\widehat{Df_{\epsilon}^{2}}(x)$  by

$$
\widehat {D f _ {\epsilon} ^ {2}} (x) = \frac {1}{k - 1} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {k} \left(f (x + \epsilon_ {i}) - f (x)\right) ^ {2}, \tag {3}
$$

with  $\{\epsilon_1,\dots,\epsilon_k\} k$  samples of  $\pmb{\epsilon}$ . Note that  $\widehat{Df^2}_{\epsilon}(x)\underset {k\to \infty}{\rightarrow}\operatorname {Var}(f(x + \epsilon))$ . Since  $Var(f(x + \epsilon)) = Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(x) + O(|\epsilon |_{2}^{3})$ ,  $\widehat{Df^2}_{\epsilon}(x)$  is a biased estimator of  $Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(x)$ , with bias  $O(|\epsilon |_{2}^{3})$ . Hence, when  $\epsilon \to 0$ ,  $\widehat{Df^2}_{\epsilon}(x)$  becomes an unbiased estimator of  $Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(x)$ . It is possible to compute  $\widehat{Df^2} (x)$  from any set of points centered around  $x$ . Therefore, we compute  $\widehat{Df^2} (X_i)$  for each  $i\in \{1,\ldots ,N\}$  using the set  $S_{k}(X)$  of  $k$ -nearest neighbors of  $X_{i}$ . We obtain  $\widehat{Df^2} (X_i)$  using

$$
\widehat {D f ^ {2}} (X _ {i}) = \frac {1}{k - 1} \sum_ {X _ {j} \in \mathcal {S} _ {k} (X _ {i})} \left(f (X _ {j}) - \frac {1}{k} \sum_ {l = 1} ^ {k} f (X _ {l})\right) ^ {2}, \tag {4}
$$

The advantages of this formulation are twofold. First,  $\widehat{Df^2}$  can even be applied to non-differentiable functions. Second, all we need is  $\{f(X_1),\ldots ,f(X_N)\}$ . In other words, the points used by  $\widehat{Df^2} (X_i)$  are those used for the training of the NN. Finally, while the definition of  $Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(x)$  is local, the definition of  $\widehat{Df^2}_{\epsilon}(x)$  holds for any  $\epsilon$ . Note that equation 4 can even be applied when the data points are too sparse for the nearest neighbors of  $X_{i}$  to be considered as close to  $X_{i}$ . It can thus be seen as a generalization of  $Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(x)$ , which tends towards  $Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(x)$  locally.

Problem 2: Unavailability of new labels To tackle problem 2, recall that the goal of the training is to find  $\theta^{*} = \underset {\theta}{\mathrm{argmin}}\widehat{J_{X}} (\theta)$ , with  $\widehat{J_X} (\theta) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_iL(f(X_i),f_\theta (X_i))$ . With the new distribution based on previous derivations, the procedure is different. Since the training points are sampled using  $\widehat{Df^2}_{\epsilon}$ , we no longer minimize  $\widehat{J_X} (\theta)$ , but  $\widehat{J_{\bar{X}}} (\theta) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_iL(f(\bar{X}_i),f_\theta (\bar{X}_i))$ , with  $\bar{X}\sim d\mathbb{P}_{\bar{X}}$  the new distribution. However,  $\widehat{J_{\bar{X}}} (\theta)$  estimates

$$
J _ {\bar {X}} (\theta) = \int_ {\mathbf {S}} L (f (x), f _ {\theta} (x)) d \mathbb {P} _ {\bar {X}}.
$$

Let  $p_X(x)dx = d\mathbb{P}_X, p_{\bar{X}}(x)dx = d\mathbb{P}_{\bar{X}}$  be the pdf of  $X$  and  $\bar{X}$  (note that  $Df_{\epsilon}^{2}\propto p_{\bar{X}}$ ). Then,

$$
J _ {\bar {X}} (\theta) = \int_ {\mathbf {S}} L (f (x), f _ {\theta} (x)) \frac {p _ {\bar {X}} (x)}{p _ {X} (x)} d \mathbb {P} _ {X}.
$$

The straightforward Monte Carlo estimator for this expression of  $J_{\bar{X}}(\theta)$  is

$$
\widehat {J _ {\bar {X} , 2}} (\theta) = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i} L (f (X _ {i}), f _ {\theta} (X _ {i})) \frac {p _ {\bar {X}} (X _ {i})}{p _ {X} (X _ {i})} \propto \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i} L (f (X _ {i}), f _ {\theta} (X _ {i})) \frac {\widehat {D f ^ {2}} (X _ {i})}{p _ {X} (X _ {i})}. \tag {5}
$$

It is therefore possible to estimate  $J_{\bar{X}}(\theta)$  with the same points as  $J_{X}(\theta)$ . All we have to do is weighting these points by  $w_{i} = \frac{\widehat{Df^{2}}(X_{i})}{p_{X}(X_{i})}$ .

# 4.2 HYPERPARAMETERS OF VBSW

The expression of  $w_{i}$  involves  $Df_{\epsilon}^{2}(X_{i})$ , whose estimation has been the goal of the previous sections. However, it also involves  $p_{X}$ , the distribution of the data. Just like for  $f$ , we do not have access to  $p_{X}$ . The estimation of  $p_{X}$  is a challenging task by itself, and standard density estimation techniques such as K-nearest neighbors or Gaussian Mixture density estimation led to extreme estimated values of  $p_{X}(X_{i})$  in our experiments. Therefore, we decided to only apply  $\omega_{i} = \widehat{Df^{2}}(X_{i})$  as a first order approximation. In practice, we re-scale the weighting points to be between 1 and  $m$ , a hyperparameter. As a result, VBSW has two hyperparameters:  $m$  and  $k$ . Their effects and interactions are studied in Appendix C.

# 4.3 VBSW FOR DEEP LEARNING

We specified that the local variance could be computed using already existing points. This statement implies to find the nearest neighbors of each point. In extremely high dimension spaces like image spaces the curse of dimensionality makes nearest neighbors spurious. In addition, the structure of the data may be highly irregular, and the concept of nearest neighbor misleading. Thus, it may be irrelevant to evaluate  $\widehat{D^2f_\epsilon}$  directly on this data.

One of the strength of DL is to construct good representations of the data, embedded in lower dimensional latent spaces. For instance, in Computer Vision, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)'s deeper layers represent more abstract features. We could leverage this representational power of NNs, and simply apply our methodology within this latent feature space.

Variance Based Samples Weighting (VBSW) for DL is recapitulated in Algorithm 1. Here,  $\mathcal{M}$  is the initial NN whose latent space will be used to project the training data set and apply VBSW. Line 1:  $m$  and  $k$  are hyperparameters that can be chosen jointly with all other hyperparameters, e.g. using a random search. Line 2: The initial NN,  $\mathcal{M}$ , is trained as usual. Notations  $\left\{\left(\frac{1}{N}, X_1\right), \ldots, \left(\frac{1}{N}, X_N\right)\right\}$  is equivalent to  $\{X_1, \ldots, X_N\}$ , because all the weights are the same  $(\frac{1}{N})$ . Line 3: The last fully

connected layer is discarded, resulting in a new model  $\mathcal{M}^*$ , and the training data set is projected in the feature space. Line 4-5: equation 4 is applied to compute the weights  $w_{i}$  that are used to weight the projected data set. To perform nearest neighbors search, we use KD-Tree (Bentley, 1975). Line 6: The last layer is re-trained (which is often equivalent to fitting a linear model) using the weighted data set and added to  $\mathcal{M}^*$  to obtain the final model  $\mathcal{M}_f$ . As a result,  $\mathcal{M}_f$  is a composition of the already trained model  $\mathcal{M}^*$  and  $f_{\theta}$  trained using the weighted data set.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

We first test this methodology on toy datasets with linear models and small NNs. Then, to illustrate how general VBSW can be, we validate it for various tasks in image classification, text regression and classification, namely MNIST (LeCun & Cortes, 2010), Cifar10 (Krizhevsky et al.) and some of the glue benchmark data sets (Wang et al., 2019) (RTE, STS-B and MRPC). We use LeNet 5 (Lecun et al., 1998), ResNet20 (He et al., 2015), two CNNs and Bert (Devlin et al., 2019) a NN based on bi-directional Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017).

# 5.1 TOY EXPERIMENTS

VBSW is studied on a Double Moon (DM) classification, in the Boston Housing (BH) regression and Breast Cancer (BC) classification data sets.

For DM, Figure 2 (c) shows that the points with highest  $w_{i}$  (in red) are close to the boundary between the two classes. Indeed, in classification, VBSW can be interpreted as local label agreement. We train a Multi Layer Perceptron of 1 layer of 4 units, using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and binary cross-entropy loss function, on a 300 points training data set for

50 random seeds. In this experiment, VBSW, i.e. weighting the data set with  $w_{i}$  is compared to baseline where no weights are applied. Figure 2 (b) and (d) displays the decision boundary of best fit for each method. VBSW provides a cleaner decision boundary than baseline. These pictures as well as the results of Table 1 show the improvement obtained with VBSW.

For BH data set, a linear model is trained and for BC data set, a MLP of 1 layer and 30 units, with a train-validation split of  $80\% -20\%$ . Both models are trained with ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2014).

Table 1: best, mean + se for each method. The metric used is accuracy for DM and BC and Mean Squared Error for BH.

Since these data sets are small and the models are light, we study the effects of the choice of  $m$  and  $k$  on the performances. Moreover, BH is a regression task and BC a classification task, so it allows studying the effect of hyperparameters more extensively. We train the models for a grid of  $20 \times 20$  different values of  $m$  and  $k$ . These hyperparameters seem to have a different impact on performances for classification and regression. In both cases, low values for  $m$  yields better results, but in classification, low values of  $k$  are better, unlike in regression. Details and visualization of this experiment can be found in Appendix C. The best results obtained with this study are compared to the best result of the same models trained without VBSW in Table 1.

# 5.2 MNIST AND CIFAR10

For MNIST, we train 40 LeNet 5, i.e. with 40 different random seeds, and then apply VBSW for 10 different random seeds, with ADAM optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Note that in the following, ADAM is used with the default parameters of its keras implementation. We record the best value obtained from the 10 VBSW training. The same procedure is followed for Cifar10, except that we train a ResNet20 for 50 random seeds and with data augmentation. The networks have been trained on 4 Nvidia K80 GPUs. The values of the hyperparameters used can be found in Appendix C. We compare the test accuracy between LeNet  $5 + \mathrm{VBSW}$ , ResNet20 + VBSW and the initial test accuracies of LeNet 5 and ResNet20 (baseline) for each of the initial networks.

Table 2: best, mean + se for each method. The metric used is accuracy. For a model  $\mathcal{M}$ , the gain  $g$  for this model is given by  $g = \max_{1\leq i\leq 10}(acc(\mathcal{M}_f^i) - acc(\mathcal{M}))$  with  $acc$  the accuracy and  $\mathcal{M}_f^i$  the VBSW model trained at the  $i$ -th random seed.  

<table><tr><td></td><td>VBSW</td><td>baseline</td><td>gain per model</td></tr><tr><td>MNIST</td><td>99.09, 98.87 ± 0.01</td><td>98.99, 98.84 ± 0.01</td><td>0.15, 0.03 ± 0.01</td></tr><tr><td>Cifar10</td><td>91.30, 90.64 ± 0.07</td><td>91.01, 90.46 ± 0.10</td><td>1.65, 0.15 ± 0.04</td></tr></table>

The results statistics are gathered in Table 2, which also displays statistics about the gain due to VBSW for each model. The results on MNIST, for all statistics and for the gain are significantly better than baseline. For Cifar10, we get a  $0.3\%$  accuracy improvement for the best model and up to  $1.65\%$  accuracy gain, meaning that among the 50 ResNet20s, there is one whose accuracy has been improved by  $1.65\%$  by VBSW. Note that applying VBSW took less than 15 minutes on a laptop with an i7-7700HQ CPU. A visualization of the samples that were weighted by the highest  $w_{i}$  is given in Figure 3.

# 5.3 RTE, STS-B AND MRPC

For this application, we did not train Bert NN, like in the previous experiments, since its purpose is to be used as is and then fine-tuned on any NLP data set. However, because of the small size of the dataset and the high number of model parameters we chose not to fine-tune the Bert model, and only to use the representations of the data sets in its latent space to apply a linear model. More specifically, we use tiny-bert (Turc et al., 2019), which is a lighter version of the initial Bert NN. We train the linear model with tensorflow, to be able to add the trained model on top of the Bert model and obtain a unified model. RTE and MRPC are classification tasks, so we use binary cross-entropy loss function to train our model. STS-B is a regression task so the model is trained with Mean Squared Error. All the models are trained with ADAM optimizer. For each task, we compare the training of the linear model with VBSW, and without VBSW (baseline). The results obtained with

VBSW are better overall, except for Pearson Correlation in STS-B, which is slightly worse than baseline (Table 3).

Table 3: best, mean + se for each method. For RTE the metric used is accuracy (m1). For MRPC, metric 1 (m1) is accuracy and metric 2 (m2) is F1 score. For STS-B, metric 1 (m1) is Spearman correlation and metric 2 (m2) is Pearson correlation.

# 6 DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK

The previous experiments demonstrate the performance improvement that VBSW can bring in practice. In addition to these results, several advantages can be pointed out.

- VBSW is validated on several different tasks, which makes it quite versatile. Moreover, the problem of high dimensionality and irregularity of  $f$ , which often arises in DL problems, is alleviated by focusing on the latent space of NN. This makes VBSW scalable. As a result, VBSW can be applied from linear regression to complex models such as ResNet, a very deep and complex CNN or Bert, for various ML tasks.  
- This validation supports an original view of the learning problem, that involves the local variations of  $f$ . Note that the study of Appendix A supports this approach as well.  
- VBSW allows to extend this approach to problems where the derivatives of  $f$  are not accessible, and sometimes not defined. Indeed, VBSW comes from Taylor expansion, which is specific to derivable functions, but in the end can be applied regardless of the properties of  $f$ .  
- Finally, this method is cost effective. In most cases, it allows to quickly improve the performances of a NN using a regular CPU. In terms of energy consumption, it is better than carrying on a whole new training with a wider and deeper NN.

We first approximated  $p_X$  to be uniform, because we could not approximate it correctly. This still led to an efficient methodology, but VBSW may benefit from a finer approximation of  $p_X$ . Improving the approximation of  $p_X$  is among our perspectives. Finally, the KD-tree and even Approximate Nearest Neighbors algorithms struggle when the data set is too big. One possibility to overcome this problem would be to parallelize their execution.

We only considered the cases where we have not access to  $f$ . However, there are ML applications where we do. For instance, in numerical simulations, for physical sciences, economics or climatology, ML can be used for various reasons, e.g. sensitivity analysis, inverse problems or to speed up computer codes (Zhu et al., 2019), (Winovich et al., 2019) or (Feng et al., 2018). In this context the data comes from numerical models, so the derivatives of  $f$  are accessible and could be used to sample training points from the distribution obtained in Section 3.3.

# 7 CONCLUSION

Our work is based on the observation that, in supervised learning, a function  $f$  is more difficult to approximate by a ML model in the regions where it is steeper. We mathematically traduced this intuition and derived a generalization bound to illustrate it. Then, we constructed an original method, Variance Based Samples Weighting (VBSW), that uses the variance of the training samples to weight the training data set and boosts the model performances. VBSW is simple to use and to implement, because it only requires to compute statistics on the input space. In Deep Learning, applying VBSW on the data set projected in the feature space of an already trained NN allows to boost its performance by simply training its last layer. This method is applicable to any loss function based supervised learning problem, scalable, cost effective, and validated on several applications such as glue benchmark with Bert, for text classification and regression and Cifar10 with a ResNet20, for image classification.
