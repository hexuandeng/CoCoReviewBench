# ABSTRACT

Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured domains is a challenging problem. Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response quality (Liu et al., 2016). Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem. We present an evaluation model (ADEM) that learns to predict human-like scores to input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEM model's predictions correlate significantly, and at level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating dialogue models unseen during training, rendering it a strong basis for dialogue response evaluation.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Learning to communicate with humans is a crucial ability for intelligent agents. Among the primary forms of communication between humans is natural language dialogue. As such, building systems that can naturally and meaningfully converse with humans has been a central goal of artificial intelligence since the formulation of the Turing test (Turing, 1950). Research on one type of such systems, sometimes referred to as non-task-oriented dialogue systems, goes back to the mid-60s with Weizenbaum's famous program ELIZA: a rule-based system mimicking a Rogerian psychotherapist by persistently either rephrasing statements or asking questions (Weizenbaum, 1966). Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the research community towards building large-scale non-task-oriented dialogue systems using neural networks (Sordoni et al., 2015b; Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals & Le, 2015; Serban et al., 2016a; Li et al., 2015). These models are trained in an end-to-end manner to optimize a single objective, usually the likelihood of generating the responses from a fixed corpus. Such models have already had a substantial impact in industry, including Google's Smart Reply system (Kannan et al., 2016), and Microsoft's Xiaoice chatbot (Markoff & Mozur, 2015), which has over 20 million users. More recently, Amazon has announced the Alexa Prize Challenge: a research competition with the goal of developing a natural and engaging chatbot system (Farber, 2016).

One of the challenges when developing such systems is to have a good way of measuring progress, in this case the performance of the chatbot. The Turing test provides one solution to the evaluation of dialogue systems, but there are limitations with its original formulation. The test requires live human interactions, which is expensive and difficult to scale up. Furthermore, the test requires carefully designing the instructions to the human interlocutors, in order to balance their behaviour and expectations so that different systems may be ranked accurately by performance. Although unavoidable, these instructions introduce bias into the evaluation measure. The more common approach of having humans evaluate the quality of dialogue system responses, rather than distinguish them from human responses, induces similar drawbacks in terms of time, expense, and lack of

scalability. In the case of chatbots designed for specific conversation domains, it may also be difficult to find sufficient human evaluators with appropriate background in the topic (e.g. Lowe et al. (2015)).

Despite advances in neural network-based models, evaluating the quality of dialogue responses automatically remains a challenging and under-studied problem in the non-task-oriented setting. The most widely used metric for evaluating such dialogue systems is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), a metric measuring word overlaps originally developed for machine translation. However, it has been shown that BLEU and other word-overlap metrics are biased and correlate poorly with human judgements of response quality (Liu et al., 2016). There are many obvious cases where these metrics fail, as they are often incapable of considering the semantic similarity between responses (see Figure 1). Despite this, many researchers still use BLEU to evaluate their dialogue models (Ritter et al., 2011; Sordoni et al.,

2015b; Li et al., 2015; Galley et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016a), as there are few alternatives available that correlate with human judgements. While human evaluation should always be used to evaluate dialogue models, it is often too expensive and time-consuming to do this for every model specification (for example, for every combination of model hyperparameters). Therefore, having an accurate model that can evaluate dialogue response quality automatically — what could be considered an automatic Turing test — is critical in the quest for building human-like dialogue agents.

To make progress towards this goal, we first collect a dataset of human scores to various dialogue responses, and we use this dataset to train an automatic dialogue evaluation model, which we call ADEM. The model is trained in a semi-supervised manner using a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict human scores. We show that ADEM scores correlate significantly, and at a level much higher than BLEU, with human judgement at both the utterance-level and system-level. Crucially, we also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating new models, whose responses were unseen during training, without a drop in performance, making ADEM a powerful tool for dialogue response evaluation. $^{1}$

# 2 A DATASET FOR DIALOGUE RESPONSE EVALUATION

To train a model to predict human scores to dialogue responses, we first collect a dataset of human judgements (scores) of Twitter responses using the crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). The aim is to have accurate human scores for a variety of conversational responses — conditioned on dialogue contexts – which span the full range of response qualities. For example, the responses should include both relevant and irrelevant responses, both coherent and non-coherent responses and so on. To achieve this variety, we use candidate responses from several different models. Following Liu et al. (2016), we use the following 4 sources of candidate responses: (1) a response selected by a TF-IDF retrieval-based model, (2) a response selected by the Dual Encoder (DE) (Lowe et al., 2015), (3) a response generated using the hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder (HRED) model (Serban et al., 2016a), and (4) human-generated responses. It should be noted that the human-generated candidate responses are not the

reference responses from a fixed corpus, but novel human responses that are different from the reference. In addition to increasing response variety, this is necessary because we want our evaluation model to learn to compare the reference responses to the candidate responses.

Table 1: Statistics of the dialogue response evaluation dataset. Each example is in the form (context, model response, reference response, human score).

We conducted two rounds of AMT experiments. We first asked AMT workers to provide a reasonable continuation of a Twitter dialogue (i.e. generate the next response given the context of a conversation). Each survey contained 20 questions, including an attention check question. Workers were instructed to generate longer responses, in order to avoid simple one-word responses. In total, we obtained approximately 2,000 human responses.

Second, we filtered these human-generated responses for potentially offensive language, and combined them with approximately 1,000 responses from each of the above models into a single set of responses. We then asked AMT workers to rate the overall quality of each response on a scale of 1 (low quality) to 5 (high quality). Each user was asked to evaluate 4 responses from 50 different contexts. We included four additional attention-check questions and a set of five contexts was given to each participant for assessment of inter-annotator agreement. We removed all users who either failed an attention check question or achieved a  $\kappa$  inter-annotator agreement score lower than 0.2 (Cohen, 1968). The remaining evaluators had a median  $\kappa$  score of 0.63, indicating moderate agreement. This is consistent with results from Liu et al. (2016). Dataset statistics are provided in Table 1.

Table 2: Median  $\kappa$  inter-annotator agreement scores for various questions asked in the survey.

In initial experiments, we also asked humans to provide scores for topicality, informativeness, and whether the context required background information to be understandable. Note that we did not ask for fluency scores, as 3/4 of the responses were produced by humans (including the retrieval models). We found that scores for informativeness and background had low inter-annotator agreement (Table 2), and scores for topicality were highly correlated with the overall score (Pearson correlation of 0.72). Results on these auxiliary questions varied depending on the wording of the question. Thus, we continued our experiments by only asking for the overall score. We provide more details concerning the data collection in the Appendix, as it may aid others in developing effective crowdsourcing experiments.

To train evaluation models on human judgements, it is crucial that we obtain scores of responses that lie near the distribution produced by state-of-the-art models. This is why we use the Twitter Corpus (Ritter et al., 2011), as such models are pre-trained and readily available. Further, the set of topics discussed is quite broad — as opposed to the very specific Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus — and therefore the model should generalize better to other domains involving chit-chat. Finally, since it does not require domain specific knowledge (e.g. technical knowledge), it should be easy for AMT workers to annotate.

# 3 TECHNICAL BACKGROUND

# 3.1 RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network with time-delayed connections between the internal units. This leads to the formation of a hidden state  $h_t$ , which is updated for every input:  $h_t = f(W_{hh}h_{t-1} + W_{ih}x_t)$ , where  $W_{hh}$  and  $W_{ih}$  are parameter matrices,  $f$  is a smooth non-linear activation function such as tanh, and  $x_t$  is the input at time  $t$ . The hidden state allows for RNNs to better model sequential data, such as natural language.

In this paper, we consider RNNs augmented with long-short term memory (LSTM) units (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). LSTMs add a set of gates to the RNN that allow it to learn how much to update the hidden state. LSTMs are one of the most well-established methods for dealing with the vanishing gradient problem in recurrent networks (Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al., 1994).

# 3.2 WORD-OVERLAP METRICS

One of the most popular approaches for automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses is by computing their word overlap with the reference response. In particular, the most popular metrics are the BLEU and METEOR scores used for machine translation, and the ROUGE score used for automatic summarization. While these metrics tend to correlate with human judgements in their target domains, they have recently been shown to highly biaqsed and correlate very poorly with

human judgements for dialogue response evaluation (Liu et al., 2016). We briefly describe BLEU here, and provide a more detailed summary of word-overlap metrics in the Appendix.

BLEU BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) analyzes the co-occurrences of n-grams in the ground truth and the proposed responses. It computes the n-gram precision for the whole dataset, which is then multiplied by a brevity penalty to penalize short translations. For BLEU-  $N$ ,  $N$  denotes the largest value of n-grams considered (usually  $N = 4$ ).

Drawbacks One of the major drawbacks of word-overlap metrics is their failure in capturing the semantic similarity between the model and reference responses when there are few or no common words. This problem is less critical for machine translation; since the set of reasonable translations of a given sentence or document is rather small, one can reasonably infer the quality of a translated sentence by only measuring the word-overlap between it and one (or a few) reference translations. However, in dialogue, the set of appropriate responses given a context is much larger (Artstein et al., 2009); in other words, there is a very high response diversity that is unlikely to be captured by word-overlap comparison to a single response.

Further, word-overlap scores are computed directly between the model and reference responses. As such, they do not consider the context of the conversation. While this may be a reasonable assumption in machine translation, it is not the case for dialogue; whether a model response is an adequate substitute for the reference response is clearly context-dependent. For example, the two responses in Figure 1 are equally appropriate given the context. However, if we simply change the context to: "Have you heard of any good movies recently?", the model response is no longer relevant while the reference response remains valid.

# 4 AN AUTOMATIC DIALOGUE EVALUATION MODEL (ADEM)

To overcome the problems of evaluation with word-overlap metrics, we aim to construct a dialogue evaluation model that: (1) captures semantic similarity beyond word overlap statistics, and (2) exploits both the context of the conversation and the reference response to calculate its score for the model response. We call this evaluation model ADEM.

ADEM learns distributed representations of the context, model response, and reference response using a hierarchical RNN encoder. Given the dialogue context  $c$ , reference response  $r$ , and model response  $\hat{r}$ , ADEM first encodes each of them into vectors  $(\mathbf{c}, \hat{\mathbf{r}}$ , and  $\mathbf{r}$ , respectively) using the RNN encoder. Then, ADEM computes the score using a dot-product between the vector representations of  $c$ ,  $r$ , and  $\hat{r}$  in a linearly transformed space: :

$$
\operatorname {s c o r e} (c, r, \hat {r}) = \left(\mathbf {c} ^ {T} M \hat {\mathbf {r}} + \mathbf {r} ^ {T} N \hat {\mathbf {r}} - \alpha\right) / \beta \tag {1}
$$

where  $M, N \in \mathbb{R}^n$  are learned matrices initialized to the identity, and  $\alpha, \beta$  are scalar constants used to initialize the model's predictions in the range [0, 5]. The model is shown in Figure 2.

The matrices  $M$  and  $N$  can be interpreted as linear projections that map the model response  $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$  into the space of contexts and reference responses, respectively. The model gives high scores to responses that have similar vector representations to the context and reference response after this projection. The model is end-to-end differentiable; all the parameters can be learned by backpropagation. In our

implementation, the parameters  $\theta = \{M,N\}$  of the model are trained to minimize the squared error between the model predictions and the human score, with L1-regularization:

$$
\mathcal {L} = \sum_ {i = 1: K} \left[ \operatorname {s c o r e} \left(c _ {i}, r _ {i}, \hat {r} _ {i}\right) - \text {h u m a n ＿ s c o r e} _ {i} \right] ^ {2} + \gamma | | \theta | | _ {1} \tag {2}
$$

where  $\gamma$  is a scalar constant. The simplicity of our model leads to both accurate predictions and fast evaluation time (see Appendix), which is important to allow rapid prototyping of dialogue systems.

The hierarchical RNN encoder in our model consists of two layers of RNNs (El Hihi & Bengio, 1995; Sordoni et al., 2015a). The lower-level RNN, the utterance-level encoder, takes as input words from the dialogue, and produces a vector output at the end of each utterance. The context-level encoder takes the representation of each utterance as input and outputs a vector representation of the context. This hierarchical structure is useful for incorporating information from early utterances in the context (Serban et al., 2016a). Following previous work, we take the last hidden state of the context-level encoder as the vector representation of the input utterance or context.

Pre-training with VHRED We would like an evaluation model that can make accurate predictions from few labeled examples, since these examples are expensive to obtain. We therefore employ semi-supervised learning, and use a pre-training procedure to learn the parameters of the encoder. In particular, we train the encoder as part of a neural dialogue model; we attach a third decoder RNN that takes the output of the encoder as input, and train it to predict the next utterance of a dialogue conditioned on the context.

The dialogue model we employ for pre-training is the latent variable hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder (VHRED) model (Serban et al., 2016b). The VHRED model is an extension of the original hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder (HRED) model (Serban et al., 2016a) with a turn-level stochastic latent variable. The dialogue context is encoded into a vector using our hierarchical encoder, and the VHRED then samples a Gaussian variable that is used to condition the decoder (see Appendix for further details). After training VHRED, we use the last hidden state of the context-level encoder, when  $c$ ,  $r$ , and  $\hat{r}$  are fed as input, as the vector representations for  $\mathbf{c}$ ,  $\mathbf{r}$ , and  $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ , respectively. We use representations from the VHRED model as it produces more diverse and coherent responses compared to its HRED counterpart.

Maximizing the likelihood of generating the next utterance in a dialogue is not only a convenient way of training the encoder parameters; it is also an objective that is consistent with learning useful representations of the dialogue utterances. Two context vectors produced by the VHRED encoder are similar if the contexts induce a similar distribution over subsequent responses; this is consistent with the formulation of the evaluation model, which assigns high scores to responses that have similar vector representations to the context. VHRED is also closely related to the skip-thought-vector model (Kiros et al., 2015), which has been shown to learn useful representations of sentences for many tasks, including semantic relatedness and paraphrase detection. The skip-thought-vector model takes as input a single sentence and predicts the previous sentence and next sentence. On the other hand, VHRED takes as input several consecutive sentences and predicts the next sentence. This makes it particularly suitable for learning long-term context representations.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

# 5.1 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

In order to reduce the effective vocabulary size, we use byte pair encoding (BPE) (Gage, 1994; Sennrich et al., 2015), which splits each word into sub-words or characters. We also use layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) for the hierarchical encoder, which we found worked better at the task of dialogue generation than the related recurrent batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015; Coolijmans et al., 2016). To train the VHRED model, we employed several of the same techniques found in Serban et al. (2016b) and Bowman et al. (2016): we drop words in the decoder with a fixed rate of  $25\%$ , and we anneal the KL-divergence term linearly from 0 to 1 over the first 60,000 batches. We use Adam as our optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014).

For training VHRED, we use a context embedding size of 2000. However, we found the ADEM model learned more effectively when this embedding size was reduced. Thus, after training VHRED,

(c) ADEM

we use principal component analysis (PCA) (Pearson, 1901) to reduce the dimensionality of the context, model response, and reference response embeddings to  $n$ . While our results are robust to  $n$ , we found experimentally that  $n = 7$  provided slightly improved performance. We provide other hyperparameter values in the Appendix.

When evaluating our models, we conduct early stopping on a separate validation set to obtain the best parameter setting. For the evaluation dataset, we split the train/ validation/ test sets such that there is no context overlap (i.e. the contexts in the test set are unseen during training).

# 5.2 RESULTS

Utterance-level correlations We first present new utterance-level correlation results² for existing word-overlap metrics, in addition to results with embedding baselines and ADEM, in Table 3. The baseline metrics are evaluated on the entire dataset of 4,104 responses, which is more than an order of magnitude larger than the utterance-level correlation study in Liu et al. (2016) (50 examples), and should represent a more accurate value of the true correlation with a human evaluator.³ We measure the correlation for ADEM on the validation and test sets (616 responses each).

We first observe that the correlations for the word-overlap metrics are even lower than estimated in previous studies (Liu et al., 2016; Galley et al., 2015). In particular, this is the case for BLEU-4, which has frequently been used for dialogue response evaluation (Ritter et al., 2011; Sordoni et al., 2015b; Li et al., 2015; Galley et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016a). We conjecture that there are two reasons

for the lower correlation scores compared to those in Liu et al. (2016). First, Liu et al. average the scores from 21 users for each response, and use the result as the score for that response. This significantly reduces the variance of the score estimates, and leads to higher correlations. We did not average scores from multiple raters for the dataset in this paper as it would lead much to a much smaller dataset size. Second, the smaller size of the datasets from previous work increases the chance that the strengths of the correlations are over-estimated. The reader should note the quality of our dataset; the human inter-annotator agreement — as measured by the  $\kappa$  score — is similar or greater than those for existing dialogue evaluation datasets.

We can see from Table 3 that ADEM correlates far better with human judgement than the word-overlap baselines. This is further illustrated by the scatterplots in Figure 3. We also compare with ADEM using tweet2vec embeddings for c, r, and  $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ , which are computed at the character-level with a bidirectional GRU (Dhingra et al., 2016), and obtain comparable but slightly inferior performance compared to using VHRED embeddings.

System-level correlations We show the system-level correlations for various metrics in Table 4, and present it visually in Figure 4. Each point in the scatterplots represents a dialogue model; humans give low scores to TFIDF and DE responses, higher scores to HRED and the highest scores to other human responses. It is clear that existing word-overlap metrics are incapable of capturing this relationship for even 4 models. This renders them completely deficient for dialogue evaluation. However, ADEM produces the exact same model ranking as humans, achieving a significant Pearson correlation of 0.98. Thus, ADEM correlates well with humans both at the response and system level.

Table 5: Correlation for ADEM when various model responses are removed from the training set.

Generalization to previously unseen models When ADEM is used in practice, it will take as input responses from a new model that it has not seen during training. Thus, it is crucial that ADEM correlates with human judgements for new models. We test ADEM's generalization ability by performing a leave-one-out evaluation. For each dialogue model that was the source of response data for training ADEM (TF-IDF, Dual Encoder, HRED, humans), we conduct an experiment where we train on all model responses except those from the chosen model, and test only on the model that was unseen during training.

The results are given in Table 5. Overall, we observe that the ADEM model is very robust, and is capable of generalizing to new models in all cases. When testing the correlation on the entire test set, the model achieves comparable correlations to the ADEM model that was trained on  $25\%$  less data selected at random. This is particularly surprising for the HRED model; in this case, ADEM was trained only on responses that were written by humans (from retrieval models or human-generated), but is able to generalize to responses produced by a generative neural network model. This demonstrates ADEM's ability to accurately score new neural network-based dialogue models.

Qualitative Analysis To illustrate some strengths and weaknesses of ADEM, we show human and ADEM scores for each of the responses to various contexts in Table 6. There are several instances where ADEM predicts accurately: in particular, ADEM is often very good at assigning low scores to poor responses. This seen in the first two contexts, where most of the responses given a score of 1 from humans are given scores less than 2 by ADEM. The single exception in response (4) for the second context seems somewhat appropriate and should perhaps have been scored higher by the human evaluator. There are also several instances where the model assigns high scores to suitable responses, as in the first two contexts.

One drawback we observed is that ADEM tends to be too conservative when predicting response scores. This is the case in the third context, where the model assigns low scores to most of the responses that a human rated highly (although response (2) is arguably not relevant to the context). This behaviour is likely due to the squared error loss used to train ADEM; since the model receives a large penalty for incorrectly predicting an extreme value, it learns to predict scores closer to the average human score.

<table><tr><td>Metric scores</td><td># Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Human ≥ 4</td><td>237 out of 616</td></tr><tr><td>and (|BLEU-2| &lt;2, |ROUGE| &lt;2)</td><td>146 out of 237</td></tr><tr><td>and |ADEM| &gt;4</td><td>60 out of 146</td></tr><tr><td>and |ADEM| &lt;2</td><td>42 out of 237</td></tr><tr><td>and (|BLEU-2| &gt;4, or |ROUGE| &gt;4)</td><td>14 out of 42</td></tr></table>

Improvement over word-overlap metrics Next, we analyze more precisely how ADEM outperforms traditional word-overlap metrics such as BLEU-2 and ROUGE. We first normalize the metric scores to have the same mean and variance as human scores, clipping the resulting scores to the range [1, 5] (we assign raw scores of 0 a normalized

Table 7: In 60/146 cases, ADEM scores good responses (human score  $>4$ ) highly when word-overlap metrics fail. The bars around |metric| indicate that the metric scores have been normalized.

score of 1). We indicate normalization with vertical bars around the metric. We then select all of the good responses that were given low scores by word-overlap metrics (i.e. responses which humans scored as 4 or higher, and which |BLEU-2| and |ROUGE| scored as 2 or lower). The results are summarized in Table 7: of the 237 responses that humans scored 4 or higher, most of them (147/237) were ranked very poorly by both BLEU-2 and ROUGE. This quantitatively demonstrates what we argued qualitatively in Figure 1; a major failure of word-overlap metrics is the inability to consider reasonable responses that have no word-overlap with the reference response. We can also see that, in almost half (60/147) of the cases where both BLEU-2 and ROUGE fail, |ADEM| is able to correctly assign a score greater than 4. For comparison, there are only 42 responses where humans give a score of 4 and |ADEM| gives a score less than 2, and only 14 of these are assigned a score greater than 4 by either |BLEU-2| or |ROUGE|.

To provide further insight, we give specific examples of responses that are scored highly ( $>4$ ) by both humans and  $|\mathrm{ADEM}|$ , and poorly ( $<2$ ) by both  $|\mathrm{BLEU-2}|$  and  $|\mathrm{ROUGE}|$  in Table 8. We draw 3 responses randomly (i.e. no cherry-picking) from the 60 test set responses that meet this criteria. We can observe that ADEM is able to recognize short responses that are appropriate to the context, without word-overlap with the reference response. This is even the case when the model and reference responses have very little semantic similarity, as in the first and third examples in Table 8.

Finally, we show the behaviour of ADEM when there is a discrepancy between the lengths of the reference and model responses. In (Liu et al., 2016), the authors show that word-overlap metrics such as BLEU-1, BLEU-2, and METEOR exhibit a bias in this scenario: they tend to assign higher scores to responses that are closer in length to the reference response. However, humans do not exhibit this bias; in other words, the quality of a response as judged by a human is roughly independent of its length. In Table 9, we show that ADEM also does not exhibit this bias towards similar-length responses. This is likely because the utterance representations it learns depend primarily on the meaning of the utterance, rather than its length.

Table 8: Examples where both human and ADEM score the model response highly, while BLEU-2 and ROUGE do not. These examples are drawn randomly (i.e. no cherry-picking) from the examples where ADEM outperforms BLEU-2 and ROUGE (as defined in the text). ADEM is able to correctly assign high scores to short responses that have no word-overlap with the reference response. The bars around |metric| indicate that the metric scores have been normalized.

# 6 RELATED WORK

Related to our approach is the literature on novel methods for the evaluation of machine translation systems, especially through the WMT evaluation task (Callison-Burch et al., 2011; Machácek & Bojar, 2014; Stanojevic et al., 2015). In particular, Gupta et al. (2015) have recently proposed to

evaluate machine translation systems using Tree-LSTMs. Their approach differs from ours as, in the dialogue domain, we must additionally condition our score on the context of the conversation, which is not necessary in translation.

Several recent approaches use hand-crafted reward features to train dialogue models using reinforcement learning (RL). For example, Li et al. (2016b) use features related to ease of answering and information flow, and Yu et al. (2016) use metrics related to turn-level appropriateness and conversational depth. These metrics are based on hand-crafted features, which only capture a small set of relevant aspects; this inevitably leads to sub-optimal performance, and it is unclear whether such objectives are preferable over retrieval-based cross-entropy or word-level maximum log-likelihood objectives. Furthermore, many of these metrics are computed at the conversation-level, and are not available for evaluating single dialogue responses. The metrics that can be computed at the response-level could be incorporated into our framework, for example by adding a term to equation 1 consisting of a dot product between these features and a vector of learned parameters.

There has been significant work on evaluation methods for task-oriented dialogue systems, which attempt to solve a user's task such as finding a restaurant. These methods include the PARADISE framework (Walker et al., 1997) and MeMo (Möller et al., 2006), which consider a task completion signal. Our models do not attempt to model task completion, and thus fall outside this domain.

# 7 DISCUSSION

We use the Twitter Corpus to train our models as it contains a broad range of non-task-oriented conversations and has been used to train many state-of-the-art models. However, our model could easily be extended to other general-purpose datasets, such as Reddit, once similar pre-trained models become publicly available. Such models are necessary even for creating a test set in a new domain, which will help us determine if ADEM generalizes to related dialogue domains.

An extension to ADEM is the incorporation of multiple reference responses. Although such responses are not available on Twitter, they could be obtained in an approximate fashion, similar to the procedure by Sordoni et al. (2015b).

The evaluation model proposed in this paper favours dialogue models that generate responses that are rated as highly appropriate by humans. It is likely that this property does not fully capture the desired end-goal of chatbot systems. For example, one possible issue with building models to approximate human judgements of response quality is the problem of generic responses. Since humans often provide high scores to generic responses — due to their appropriateness for many given contexts — a model trained to predict these scores may exhibit the same behaviour. This could be alleviated by building a second evaluation model that assigns a score based on how easy it is to distinguish the dialogue model responses from human responses. In this case, a model that generates primarily generic responses will easily be distinguished from human responses and obtain a low score.

An important direction of future research is building models that can evaluate the capability of a dialogue system to have an engaging and meaningful interaction with a human. Compared to evaluating a single response in a dialogue, such an evaluation is arguably closer to the end-goal of chatbots. However, such an evaluation is extremely challenging to do in a completely automatic way. We view the evaluation procedure presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal; current dialogue systems are incapable of generating responses that are rated as highly appropriate by humans, and we believe our evaluation model will be critical for measuring and facilitating progress in this direction.
