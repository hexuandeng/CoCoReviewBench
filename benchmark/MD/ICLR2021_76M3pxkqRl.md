# ABSTRACT

Individual rationality, which involves maximizing expected individual return, does not always lead to optimal individual or group outcomes in multi-agent problems. For instance, in social dilemma situations, Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents trained to maximize individual rewards converge to mutual defection that is individually and socially sub-optimal. In contrast, humans evolve individual and socially optimal strategies in such social dilemmas. Inspired by ideas from human psychology that attribute this behavior in humans to the status-quo bias, we present a status-quo loss (SQLoss) and the corresponding policy gradient algorithm that incorporates this bias in an RL agent. We demonstrate that agents trained with SQLoss evolve individually as well as socially optimal behavior in several social dilemma matrix games. To apply SQLoss to games where cooperation and defection are determined by a sequence of non-trivial actions, we present GameDistill, an algorithm that reduces a multi-step game with visual input to a matrix game. We empirically show how agents trained with SQLoss on a GameDistill reduced version of the Coin Game evolve optimal policies.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In sequential social dilemmas, individually rational behavior leads to outcomes that are sub-optimal for each individual in the group (Hardin, 1968; Ostrom, 1990; Ostrom et al., 1999; Dietz et al., 2003). Current state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods that train agents independently can lead to agents that play selfishly and do not converge to optimal policies, even in simple social dilemmas (Foerster et al., 2018; Lerer & Peysakhovich, 2017).

To illustrate why it is challenging to evolve optimal policies in such dilemmas, we consider the Coin Game (Foerster et al., 2018). Each agent can play either selfishly (pick all coins) or cooperatively (pick only coins of its color). Regardless of the other agent's behavior, the individually rational choice for an agent is to play selfishly, either to minimize losses (avoid being exploited) or to maximize gains (exploit the other agent). However, when both agents behave rationally, they try to pick all coins and achieve an average long term reward of  $-0.5$ . In contrast, if both play cooperatively, then the average long term reward for each agent is 0.5. Therefore, when agents cooperate, they are both better off. Training Deep RL agents independently in the Coin Game using state-of-the-art methods leads to mutually harmful selfish behavior (Section 2.2).

The problem of how independently learning agents evolve optimal behavior in social dilemmas has been studied by researchers through human studies and simulation models (Fudenberg & Maskin, 1986; Green & Porter, 1984; Fudenberg et al., 1994; Kamada & Kominers, 2010; Abreu et al., 1990). A large body of work has looked at the mechanism of evolution of cooperation through reciprocal behaviour and indirect reciprocity (Trivers, 1971; Axelrod, 1984; Nowak & Sigmund, 1992; 1993; 1998), through variants of reinforcement using aspiration (Macy & Flache, 2002), attitude (Damer & Gini, 2008) or multi-agent reinforcement learning (Sandholm & Crites, 1996; Wunder et al., 2010), and under specific conditions (Banerjee & Sen, 2007) using different learning rates (de Cote et al., 2006) similar to WoLF (Bowling & Veloso, 2002) as well as using embedded emotion (Yu et al., 2015), social networks (Ohtsuki et al., 2006; Santos & Pacheco, 2006).

However, these approaches do not directly apply to Deep RL agents (Leibo et al., 2017). Recent work in this direction (Kleiman-Weiner et al., 2016; Julien et al., 2017; Peysakhovich & Lerer, 2018) focuses on letting agents learn strategies in multi-agent settings through interactions with

other agents. Leibo et al. (2017) defines the problem of social dilemmas in the Deep RL framework and analyzes the outcomes of a fruit-gathering game (Julien et al., 2017). They vary the abundance of resources and the cost of conflict in the fruit environment to generate degrees of cooperation between agents. Hughes et al. (2018) defines an intrinsic reward (inequality aversion) that attempts to reduce the difference in obtained rewards between agents. The agents are designed to have an aversion to both advantageous (guilt) and disadvantageous (unfairness) reward allocation. This handcrafting of loss with mutual fairness evolves cooperation, but it leaves the agent vulnerable to exploitation. LOLA (Foerster et al., 2018) uses opponent awareness to achieve high cooperation levels in the Coin Game and the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game. However, the LOLA agent assumes access to the other agent's network architecture, observations, and learning algorithms. This access level is analogous to getting complete access to the other agent's private information and therefore devising a strategy with full knowledge of how they are going to play. Wang et al. (2019) proposes an evolutionary Deep RL setup to evolve cooperation. They define an intrinsic reward that is based on features generated from the agent's past and future rewards, and this reward is shared with other agents. They use evolution to maximize the sum of rewards among the agents and thus evolve cooperative behavior. However, sharing rewards in this indirect way enforces cooperation rather than evolving it through independently learning agents.

Interestingly, humans evolve individual and socially optimal strategies in such social dilemmas without sharing rewards or having access to private information. Inspired by ideas from human psychology (Samuelson & Zeckhauser, 1988; Kahneman et al., 1991; Kahneman, 2011; Thaler & Sunstein, 2009) that attribute this behavior in humans to the status-quo bias (Guney & Richter, 2018), we present the  $SQLoss$  and the corresponding status-quo policy gradient formulation for RL. Agents trained with  $SQLoss$  evolve optimal policies in multi-agent social dilemmas without sharing rewards, gradients, or using a communication channel. Intuitively,  $SQLoss$  encourages an agent to stick to the action taken previously, with the encouragement proportional to the reward received previously. Therefore, mutually cooperating agents stick to cooperation since the status-quo yields higher individual reward, while unilateral defection by any agent leads to the other agent also switching to defection due to the status-quo loss. Subsequently, the short-term reward of exploitation is overcome by the long-term cost of mutual defection, and agents gradually switch to cooperation.

To apply  $SQLoss$  to games where a sequence of non-trivial actions determines cooperation and defection, we present GameDistill, an algorithm that reduces a dynamic game with visual input to a matrix game. GameDistill uses self-supervision and clustering to extract distinct policies from a sequential social dilemma game automatically.

Our key contributions can be summarised as:

1. We introduce a Status-Quo loss (SQLoss, Section 2.3) and an associated policy gradient-based algorithm to evolve optimal behavior for agents playing matrix games that can act in either a cooperative or a selfish manner, by choosing between a cooperative and selfish policy. We empirically demonstrate that agents trained with the SQLoss evolve optimal behavior in several social dilemmas iterated matrix games (Section 4).  
2. We propose GameDistill (Section 2.4), an algorithm that reduces a social dilemma game with visual observations to an iterated matrix game by extracting policies that implement cooperative and selfish behavior. We empirically demonstrate that GameDistill extracts cooperative and selfish policies for the Coin Game (Section 4.2).  
3. We demonstrate that when agents run GameDistill followed by MARL game-play using SQLoss, they converge to individually as well as socially desirable cooperative behavior in a social dilemma game with visual observations (Section 4.2).

# 2 APPROACH

# 2.1 SOCIAL DILEMMAS MODELED AS ITERATED MATRIX GAMES

To remain consistent with previous work, we adopt the notations from Foerster et al. (2018). We model social dilemmas as general-sum Markov (simultaneous move) games. A multi-agent Markov game is specified by  $G = \langle S, A, U, P, r, n, \gamma \rangle$ .  $S$  denotes the state space of the game.  $n$  denotes the

number of agents playing the game. At each step of the game, each agent  $a \in A$ , selects an action  $u^a \in U$ .  $\vec{u}$  denotes the joint action vector that represents the simultaneous actions of all agents. The joint action  $\vec{u}$  changes the state of the game from  $s$  to  $s'$  according to the state transition function  $P(s'| \vec{u}, s): S \times \mathbf{U} \times S \to [0,1]$ . At the end of each step, each agent  $a$  gets a reward according to the reward function  $r^a(s, \vec{u}): S \times \mathbf{U} \to \mathbb{R}$ . The reward obtained by an agent at each step is a function of the actions played by all agents. For an agent  $a$ , the discounted future return from time  $t$  is defined as  $R_t^a = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \gamma^l r_{t+l}^a$ , where  $\gamma \in [0,1)$  is the discount factor. Each agent independently attempts to maximize its expected discounted return.

Matrix games are the special case of two-player perfectly observable Markov games (Foerster et al., 2018). Table 1 shows examples of matrix games that represent social dilemmas. Consider the Prisoner's Dilemma game in Table 1a. Each agent can either cooperate  $(C)$  or defect  $(D)$ . Playing  $D$  is the rational choice for an agent, regardless of whether the other agent plays  $C$  or  $D$ . Therefore, if both agents play rationally, they each receive a reward of  $-2$ . However, if each agent plays  $C$ , then it will obtain a reward of  $-1$ . This fact that individually rational behavior leads to a sub-optimal group (and individual) outcome highlights the dilemma.

In Infinitely Iterated Matrix Games, agents repeatedly play a particular matrix game against each other. In each iteration of the game, each agent has access to the actions played by both agents in the previous iteration. Therefore, the state input to an RL agent consists of both agents' actions in the previous iteration of the game. We adopt this state formulation as is typically done in such games (Press & Dyson, 2012; Foerster et al., 2018). The infinitely iterated variations of the matrix games in Table 1 represent sequential social dilemmas. We refer to infinitely iterated matrix games as iterated matrix games in subsequent sections for ease of presentation.

# 2.2 LEARNING POLICIES IN ITERATED MATRIX GAMES: THE SELFISH LEARNER

The standard method to model agents in iterated matrix games is to model each agent as an RL agent that independently attempts to maximize its expected total discounted reward. Several approaches to model agents in this way use policy gradient-based methods (Sutton et al., 2000; Williams, 1992). Policy gradient methods update an agent's policy, parameterized by  $\theta^a$ , by performing gradient ascent on the expected total discounted reward  $\mathbb{E}[R_0^a]$ . Formally, let  $\theta^a$  denote the parameterized version of an agent's policy  $\pi^a$  and  $V_{\theta^{1},\theta^{2}}^a$  denote the total expected discounted reward for agent  $a$ . Here,  $V^a$  is a function of the policy parameters  $(\theta^1,\theta^2)$  of both agents. In the  $i^{th}$  iteration of the game, each agent updates  $\theta_i^a$  to  $\theta_{i + 1}^a$ , such that it maximizes its total expected discounted reward.  $\theta_{i + 1}^a$  is computed as follows:

$$
\theta_ {i + 1} ^ {1} = \operatorname {a r g m a x} _ {\theta^ {1}} V ^ {1} \left(\theta^ {1}, \theta_ {i} ^ {2}\right) \quad \text {a n d} \quad \theta_ {i + 1} ^ {2} = \operatorname {a r g m a x} _ {\theta^ {2}} V ^ {2} \left(\theta_ {i} ^ {1}, \theta^ {2}\right) \tag {1}
$$

For agents trained using reinforcement learning, the gradient ascent rule to update  $\theta_{i + 1}^{1}$  is,

$$
f _ {n l} ^ {1} = \nabla_ {\theta_ {1} ^ {i}} V ^ {1} \left(\theta_ {i} ^ {1}, \theta_ {i} ^ {2}\right) \cdot \delta \quad \text {a n d} \quad \theta_ {i + 1} ^ {1} = \theta_ {i} ^ {1} + f _ {n l} ^ {1} \left(\theta_ {i} ^ {1}, \theta_ {i} ^ {2}\right) \tag {2}
$$

where  $\delta$  is the step size of the updates. In the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game, agents trained with the policy gradient update method converge to a sub-optimal mutual defection equilibrium (Figure 3a, Lerer & Peysakhovich (2017)). This sub-optimal equilibrium attained by Selfish Learners motivates us to explore alternative methods that could lead to a desirable cooperative equilibrium. We denote the agent trained using policy gradient updates as a Selfish Learner  $(SL)$ .

# 2.3 LEARNING POLICIES IN ITERATED MATRIX GAMES: THE STATUS-QUO AWARE LEARNER (SQLoss)

Figure 1 shows the high-level architecture of our approach.

# 2.3.1 SQLoss: INTUITION

Why do independent, selfish learners converge to mutually harmful behavior in the IPD? To understand this, consider the payoff matrix for a single iteration of the IPD in Table 1a. In each iteration, an agent can play either  $C$  or  $D$ . Mutual defection  $(DD)$  is worse for each agent than mutual cooperation  $(CC)$ . However, one-sided exploitation  $(DC$  or  $CD)$  is better than mutual cooperation for the exploiter and far worse for the exploited. Therefore, as long as an agent perceives the possibility

Figure 1: High-level architecture of our approach. Each agent runs GameDistill by performing steps (1), (2), (3) individually to obtain two oracles per agent. During game-play(4), each agent (with  $SQLoss$ ) takes either the action suggested by the cooperation or the defection oracle

of exploitation, it is drawn to defect, both to maximize the reward (through exploitation) and minimize its loss (through being exploited). To increase the likelihood of cooperation, it is important to reduce instances of exploitation between agents. We posit that, if agents either mutually cooperate  $(CC)$  or mutually defect  $(DD)$ , then they will learn to prefer  $C$  over  $D$  and achieve a socially desirable equilibrium. (for a detailed illustration of the evolution of cooperation, see Appendix C, which is part of the Supplementary Material)

Motivated by ideas from human psychology that attribute cooperation in humans to the status-quo bias (Guney & Richter, 2018), we introduce a status-quo loss (SQLoss) for each agent, derived from the idea of imaginary game-play (Figure 2). Intuitively, the loss encourages an agent to imagine an episode where the status-quo (current situation) is repeated for several steps. This imagined episode causes the exploited agent (in  $DC$ ) to perceive a continued risk of exploitation and, therefore, quickly move to  $(DD)$ . Hence, for the exploiting agent, the short-term gain from exploitation  $(DC)$  is overcome by the long-term loss from mutual defection  $(DD)$ . Therefore, agents move towards mutual cooperation  $(CC)$  or mutual defection  $(DD)$ . With exploitation (and subsequently, the fear of being exploited) being discouraged, agents move towards cooperation.

Figure 2: Intuition behind Status - Quo-aware learner. At each step, the  $SQLoss$  encourages an agent to imagine the consequences of sticking to the status-quo by imagining an episode where the status-quo is repeated for  $\kappa$  steps. Section 2.3 describes  $SQLoss$  in more detail.

# 2.3.2 SQLoss: FORMULATION

We describe below the formulation of SQLoss with respect to agent 1. The formulation for agent 2 is identical to that of agent 1. Let  $\tau_{a} = (s_{0},u_{0}^{1},u_{0}^{2},r_{0}^{1},\dots s_{T},u_{T}^{1},u_{T}^{2},r_{T}^{1})$  denote the collection of an agent's experiences after  $T$  time steps. Let  $R_{t}^{1}(\tau_{1}) = \sum_{l = t}^{T}\gamma^{l - t}r_{l}^{1}$  denote the discounted future return for agent 1 starting at  $s_t$  in actual game-play. Let  $\hat{\tau}_{1}$  denote the collection of an agent's imagined experiences. For a state  $s_t$ , where  $t\in [0,T]$ , an agent imagines an episode by starting at  $s_t$  and repeating  $u_{t - 1}^{1},u_{t - 1}^{2}$  for  $\kappa_{t}$  steps. This is equivalent to imagining a  $\kappa_{t}$  step repetition of already played actions. We sample  $\kappa_{t}$  from a Discrete Uniform distribution  $\mathbb{U}\{1,z\}$  where  $z$  is a hyper-parameter  $\geq 1$ . To simplify notation, let  $\phi_t(s_t,\kappa_t)$  denote the ordered set of state, actions, and rewards starting at time  $t$  and repeated  $\kappa_{t}$  times for imagined game-play. Let  $\hat{R}_t^1 (\hat{\tau}_1)$  denote the discounted future return starting at  $s_t$  in imagined status-quo game-play.

$$
\phi_ {t} \left(s _ {t}, \kappa_ {t}\right) = \left[ \left(s _ {t}, u _ {t - 1} ^ {1}, u _ {t - 1} ^ {2}, r _ {t - 1} ^ {1}\right) _ {0}, \left(s _ {t}, u _ {t - 1} ^ {1}, u _ {t - 1} ^ {2}, r _ {t - 1} ^ {1}\right) _ {1}, \dots , \left(s _ {t}, u _ {t - 1} ^ {1}, u _ {t - 1} ^ {2}, r _ {t - 1} ^ {1}\right) _ {\kappa_ {t} - 1} \right] \tag {3}
$$

$$
\hat {\tau} _ {1} = \left(\phi_ {t} \left(s _ {t}, \kappa_ {t}\right), \left(s _ {t + 1}, u _ {t + 1} ^ {1}, u _ {t + 1} ^ {2}, r _ {t + 1} ^ {1}\right) _ {\kappa_ {t} + 1}, \dots , \left(s _ {T}, u _ {T} ^ {1}, u _ {T} ^ {2}, r _ {T} ^ {1}\right) _ {T + \kappa_ {t} - t}\right) \tag {4}
$$

$$
\hat {R} _ {t} ^ {1} \left(\hat {\tau} _ {1}\right) = \left(\frac {1 - \gamma^ {\kappa}}{1 - \gamma}\right) r _ {t - 1} ^ {1} + \gamma^ {\kappa} R _ {t} ^ {1} \left(\tau_ {1}\right) = \left(\frac {1 - \gamma^ {\kappa}}{1 - \gamma}\right) r _ {t - 1} ^ {1} + \gamma^ {\kappa} \sum_ {l = t} ^ {T} \gamma^ {l - t} r _ {l} ^ {1} \tag {5}
$$

$V_{\theta^1,\theta^2}^1$  and  $\hat{V}_{\theta^1,\theta^2}^1$  are approximated by  $\mathbb{E}[R_0^1 (\tau_1)]$  and  $\mathbb{E}[\hat{R}_0^1 (\hat{\tau}_1)]$  respectively. These  $V$  values are the expected rewards conditioned on both agents' policies  $(\pi^1,\pi^2)$ . For agent 1, the regular gradients and the Status-Quo gradients,  $\nabla_{\theta^1}\mathbb{E}[R_0^1 (\tau_1)]$  and  $\nabla_{\theta^1}\mathbb{E}[\hat{R}_0^1 (\hat{\tau}_1)]$ , can be derived from the policy gradient formulation as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} \mathbb {E} \left[ R _ {0} ^ {1} \left(\tau_ {1}\right) \right] = \mathbb {E} \left[ R _ {0} ^ {1} \left(\tau_ {1}\right) \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} \log \pi^ {1} \left(\tau_ {1}\right) \right] = \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} \log \pi^ {1} \left(u _ {t} ^ {1} \mid s _ {t}\right) \cdot \sum_ {l = t} ^ {T} \gamma^ {l} r _ {l} ^ {1} \right] \tag {6} \\ = \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} \log \pi^ {1} (u _ {t} ^ {1} | s _ {t}) \gamma^ {t} \left(R _ {t} ^ {1} (\tau_ {1}) - b (s _ {t})\right) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \hat {R} _ {0} ^ {1} (\hat {\tau} _ {1}) \right] = \mathbb {E} \left[ \hat {R} _ {0} ^ {1} (\hat {\tau} _ {1}) \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} \log \pi^ {1} (\hat {\tau} _ {1}) \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} l o g \pi^ {1} \left(u _ {t - 1} ^ {1} | s _ {t}\right) \times \left(\sum_ {l = t} ^ {t + \kappa} \gamma^ {l} r _ {t - 1} ^ {1} + \sum_ {l = t} ^ {T} \gamma^ {l + \kappa} r _ {l} ^ {1}\right) \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} \log \pi^ {1} \left(u _ {t - 1} ^ {1} \mid s _ {t}\right) \times \left(\left(\frac {1 - \gamma^ {\kappa}}{1 - \gamma}\right) \gamma^ {t} r _ {t - 1} ^ {1} + \gamma^ {\kappa} \sum_ {l = t} ^ {T} \gamma^ {l} r _ {l} ^ {1}\right) \right] \tag {7} \\ = \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} l o g \pi^ {1} \left(u _ {t - 1} ^ {1} | s _ {t}\right) \gamma^ {t} \left(\hat {R} _ {t} ^ {1} (\hat {\tau} _ {1}) - b (s _ {t})\right) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $b(s_{t})$  is a baseline for variance reduction.

Then the update rule  $f_{sql,pg}$  for the policy gradient-based Status-Quo Learner (SQL-PG) is,

$$
f _ {s q l, p g} ^ {1} = \left(\alpha \cdot \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} \mathbb {E} \left[ R _ {0} ^ {1} \left(\tau_ {1}\right) \right] + \beta \cdot \nabla_ {\theta^ {1}} \mathbb {E} \left[ \hat {R} _ {0} ^ {1} \left(\tau_ {1}\right) \right]\right) \cdot \delta \tag {8}
$$

where  $\alpha, \beta$  denote the loss scaling factor for REINFORCE, imaginative game-play respectively.

# 2.4 LEARNING POLICIES IN DYNAMIC NON-MATRIX GAMES USING SQLoss AND GameDistill

The previous section focused on evolving optimal policies in iterated matrix games that represent sequential social dilemmas. In such games, an agent can take one of a discrete set of policies at each step. For instance, in IPD, an agent can either cooperate or defect at each step. However, in social dilemmas such as the Coin Game (Appendix A), cooperation and defection policies are composed of a sequence of state-dependent actions. To apply the Status-Quo policy gradient to these games, we present GameDistill, a self-supervised algorithm that reduces a dynamic game with visual input to a matrix game. GameDistill takes as input game-play episodes between agents with random policies and learns oracles (or policies) that lead to distinct outcomes. GameDistill (Figure 1) works as follows.

1. We initialize agents with random weights and play them against each other in the game. In these random game-play episodes, whenever an agent receives a reward, we store the sequence of states along with the rewards for both agents.  
2. This collection of state sequences is used to train the GameDistill network, which is a self-supervised trajectory encoder. It takes as input a sequence of states and predicts the rewards of both agents during training.  
3. We then extract the embeddings from the penultimate layer of the trained GameDistill network for each state sequence. Each embedding is a finite-dimensional representation of the corresponding state sequence. We cluster these embeddings using Agglomerative Clustering (Friedman et al., 2001). Each cluster represents a collection of state sequences that lead to a consistent outcome (with respect to rewards). For the Coin Game, when we

Table 1: Payoff matrices for the different games used in our experiments.  $(X,Y)$  in a cell represents a reward of  $X$  to the row and  $Y$  to the column player.  $C, D, H,$  and  $T$  denote the actions for the row and column players. In the iterated versions of these games, agents play against each other over several iterations. In each iteration, an agent takes an action and receives a reward based on the actions of both agents. Each matrix represents a different kind of social dilemma.

use the number of clusters as 2, we find that one cluster consists of state sequences that represent cooperative behavior (cooperation cluster) while the other cluster represents state sequences that lead to defection (defection cluster).

4. Using the state sequences in each cluster, we train an oracle to predict the next action given the current state. For the Coin Game, the oracle trained on state sequences from the cooperation cluster predicts the cooperative action for a given state. Similarly, the oracle trained on the defection cluster predicts the defection action for a given state. Each agent uses GameDistill independently to extract a cooperation and a defection oracle. Figure 8 (Appendix D.4) illustrates the cooperation and defection oracles extracted by the Red agent using GameDistill.

During game-play, an agent can consult either oracle at each step. In the Coin Game, this is equivalent to either cooperating (consulting the cooperation oracle) or defecting (consulting the defection oracle). In this way, an agent reduces a dynamic game to its matrix equivalent using GameDistill. We then apply the Status-Quo policy gradient to evolve optimal policies in this matrix game. For the Coin Game, this leads to agents who cooperate by only picking coins of their color (Figure 4a). It is important to note that for games such as the Coin Game, we could have also learned cooperation and defection oracles by training agents using the sum of rewards for both agents and individual reward, respectively (Lerer & Peysakhovich, 2017). However, GameDistill learns these distinct policies without using hand-crafted reward functions.

Appendix B provides additional details about the architecture and pseudo-code for GameDistill.

# 3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

In order to compare our results to previous work, we use the Normalized Discounted Reward or  $NDR = (1 - \gamma)\sum_{t=0}^{T}\gamma^{t}r_{t}$ . A higher NDR implies that an agent obtains a higher reward in the environment. We compare our approach (Status-Quo Aware Learner or SQLLearner) to Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (Lola-PG) (Foerster et al., 2018) and the Selfish Learner (SL) agents. For all experiments, we perform 20 runs and report average  $NDR$ , along with variance across runs. The bold line in all the figures is the mean, and the shaded region is the one standard deviation region around the mean. All of our code is available at https://github.com/user12423/MARL-with-SQLLoss/.

# 3.1 ITERATED MATRIX GAME SOCIAL DILEMMAS

For our experiments with social dilemma matrix games, we use the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma (IPD) (Luce & Raiffa, 1989), Iterated Matching Pennies (IMP) (Lee & Louis, 1967), and the Iterated Stag Hunt (ISH) (Fang et al., 2002). Each matrix game in Table 1 represents a different dilemma. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the rational policy for each agent is to defect, regardless of the other agent's policy. However, when each agent plays rationally, each is worse off. In Matching Pennies, if an agent plays predictably, it is prone to exploitation by the other agent. Therefore, the optimal policy is to randomize between  $H$  and  $T$ , obtaining an average NDR of 0. The Stag Hunt game represents a coordination dilemma. In the game, given that the other agent will cooperate, an agent's optimal action is to cooperate as well. However, each agent has an attractive alternative at each step, that of defecting and obtaining a guaranteed reward of  $-1$ . Therefore, the promise of a safer alternative

and the fear that the other agent might select the safer choice could drive an agent to select the safer alternative, thereby sacrificing the higher reward of mutual cooperation.

In iterated matrix games, at each iteration, agents take an action according to a policy and receive the rewards in Table 1. To simulate an infinitely iterated game, we let the agents play 200 iterations of the game against each other, and do not provide an agent with any information about the number of remaining iterations. In an iteration, the state for an agent is the actions played by both agents in the previous iteration.

# 3.2 ITERATED DYNAMIC GAME SOCIAL DILEMMAS

For our experiments on a social dilemma with extended actions, we use the Coin Game (Figure 5a) (Foerster et al., 2018) and the non-matrix variant of the Stag Hunt (Figure 5b). We provide details of these games in Appendix A due to space considerations.

# 4.1 LEARNING OPTIMAL POLICIES IN ITERATED MATRIX DILEMMAS

Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD): We train different learners to play the IPD game. Figure 3a shows the results. For all learners, agents initially defect and move towards an NDR of  $-2.0$ . This initial bias towards defection is expected, since, for agents trained with random game-play episodes, the benefits of exploitation outweigh the costs of mutual defection. For Selfish Learner (SL) agents, the bias intensifies, and the agents converge to mutually harmful selfish behavior (NDR of  $-2.0$ ). Lola-PG agents learn to predict each other's behavior and realize that defection is more likely to lead to mutual harm. They subsequently move towards cooperation, but occasionally defect (NDR of  $-1.2$ ). In contrast,  $SQLearner$  agents quickly realize the costs of defection, indicated by the small initial dip in the NDR curves. They subsequently move towards close to  $100\%$  cooperation, with an NDR of  $-1.0$ . Finally, it is important to note that  $SQLearner$  agents have close to zero variance, unlike other methods where the variance in NDR across runs is significant.

Iterated Matching Pennies (IMP): We train different learners to play the IMP game. Figure 3b shows the results.  $SQLearner$  agents learn to play optimally and obtain an NDR close to 0. Interestingly, Selfish Learner and Lola-PG agents converge to an exploiter-exploited equilibrium where one agent consistently exploits the other agent. This asymmetric exploitation equilibrium is more pronounced for Selfish Learner agents than for Lola-PG agents. As before, we observe that  $SQLearner$  agents have close to zero variance across runs, unlike other methods where the variance in NDR across runs is significant.

Iterated Stag Hunt (ISH): Appendix D.5 shows additional results for the ISH game.

GameDistill: To evaluate the Agglomerative clustering step in GameDistill, we make two t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) plots of the 100-dimensional feature vectors extracted from the penultimate layer of the trained GameDistill network in Figure 4b. In the first plot, we color each point (or state sequence) by the rewards obtained by both agents in the format  $r_1|r_2$ . In the second, we color each point by the cluster label output by the clustering technique. GameDistill correctly learns two clusters, one for state sequences that represent cooperation (Red cluster) and the other for state sequences that represent defection (Blue cluster). We experiment with different values for feature vector dimensions and obtain similar results (see Appendix B for details). Results on Stag Hunt using GameDistill are presented in Appendix D.3. To evaluate the trained oracles that represent cooperation and a defection policy, we alter the Coin Game environment to contain only a single agent (the Red agent). We then play two variations of the game. In the first variation, the Red agent is forced to play the action suggested by the first oracle. In this variation, we find that the Red agent picks only  $8.4\%$  of Blue coins, indicating a high cooperation rate. Therefore, the first oracle represents a cooperation policy. In the second variation, the Red agent is forced to play the action suggested by the second oracle. We find that the Red agent picks  $99.4\%$  of Blue coins, indicating a high defection rate, and the second oracle represents a defection policy.

SQ Loss: During game-play, at each step, an agent follows either the action suggested by its cooperation oracle or the action suggested by its defection oracle. We compare approaches using the degree of cooperation between agents, measured by the probability that an agent will pick the coin of its color (Foerster et al., 2018). Figure 4a shows the results. The probability that an  $SQLearner$  agent will pick the coin of its color is close to 1. This high probability indicates that the other  $SQLearner$  agent is cooperating with this agent and only picking coins of its color. In contrast, the probability that a Lola-PG agent will pick a coin of its color is close to 0.8, indicating higher defection rates. As expected, the probability of an agent picking its own coin is the smallest for the selfish learner (SL).

# 5 CONCLUSION

We presented a status-quo policy gradient inspired by human psychology that encourages an agent to imagine the counterfactual of sticking to the status quo. We demonstrated how agents trained with  $SQLoss$  evolve optimal policies in several social dilemmas without sharing rewards, gradients, or using a communication channel. To work with dynamic games, we proposed GameDistill, an algorithm that reduces a dynamic game with visual input to a matrix game. We combined GameDistill and  $SQLoss$  to demonstrate how agents evolve optimal policies in dynamic social dilemmas with visual observations.
