# ABSTRACT

Most of the conventional semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods assume that the classes of unlabeled data are contained in the set of classes of labeled data. In addition, these methods do not discriminate unlabeled samples and use all the unlabeled data for learning, which is not suitable for realistic situations. In this paper, we propose an SSL method called selective self-training (SST), which selectively decides whether to include each unlabeled sample in the training process or not. It is also designed to be applied to a more realistic situation where classes of unlabeled data are different from the ones of the labeled data. For the conventional SSL problems of fixed classes, the proposed method not only performs comparable to other conventional SSL algorithms, but also can be combined with other SSL algorithms. For the new SSL problems of increased classes where the conventional methods cannot be applied, the proposed method does not show any performance degradation even if the classes of unlabeled data are different from those of the labeled data.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Recently, machine learning has achieved a lot of successes in various fields, and high-quality data is one of the most important factors for the successes (Everingham et al., 2010; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Russakovsky et al., 2015). However, since we do not know the underlying real distribution of data, we need a lot of samples to estimate it correctly (Nasrabadi, 2007). On the other hand, creating a large amount of dataset requires huge amount of time, cost and manpower (Odena et al., 2018).

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a method of solving the problem of inefficiencies in data collection and annotation processes, which lies in between the supervised learning and unsupervised learning in that both the labeled and unlabeled data are used in the learning process (Chapelle et al., 2009; Odena et al., 2018). It efficiently improves the performance of a model by applying a supervised learning method to unlabeled data with an appropriate loss function. Also, it has been studied in various ways and has greatly improved performances (Zhu et al., 2003; Rosenberg et al., 2005; Kingma et al., 2014; Rasmus et al., 2015; Odena, 2016).

However, there is a recent research discussing the limitations of conventional SSL methods (Odena et al., 2018). They pointed out that conventional SSL algorithms are difficult to be applied to real applications. The conventional methods assume that all the unlabeled data belong to one of the classes of the training labeled data. Therefore, if there are unlabeled data that do not belong to the training classes, the performance of traditional SSL techniques may degrade. We could experimentally find some algorithms that do not degrade performance much in this situation, although they are not suitable for incremental learning which is a required aspect in many real applications. Also, whenever a new set of data is available, they should be trained from the start using all the data including out-of-class $^{1}$  data.

In this paper, we propose a method named as selective self-training (SST) to solve the limitations mentioned above. Unlike the conventional methods, our algorithm does not use all of the unlabeled

data for the training, and it rather uses them selectively. By the proposed selection method, reliable samples can be added to the training set, and uncertain samples including out-of-class data may be excluded. SST does not use the output of a classification network for data selection. Instead, we adopt a separate selection network so that the network decides whether to add each sample or not. Our selection network does not utilize softmax function because it outputs a relative value and it can output a high value even for an out-of-class sample. Instead, our selection network is designed to output an absolute confidence score using the sigmoid activation function.

SST requires fewer hyper-parameters and settings than other algorithms. Conventional algorithms require various hyper-parameters and detailed settings (Salimans & Kingma, 2016; Laine & Aila, 2016; Luo et al., 2017). On the other hand, in the SST, only one hyper-parameter of selection threshold is added to the ones for the supervised learning. In addition, the proposed SST is suitable for lifelong learning which make use of more knowledge from previously acquired knowledge (Thrun & Mitchell, 1995; Carlson et al., 2010; Chen & Liu, 2018). Since SSL can be learned with unlabeled data, any algorithm for SSL may seem appropriate for lifelong learning. But conventional SSL algorithms are inefficient when out-of-class samples are included in the unlabeled data. However, SST can only add samples highly related with in-class data and is suitable for lifelong learning.

SST can be categorized as a self-training method (McLachlan, 1975; Zhu, 2007; Zhu & Goldberg, 2009), but it is a new approach to add data using the selection network. With the new approach, SST has the following advantages.

- For the conventional SSL problems of fixed classes, the proposed SST method not only performs comparable to other conventional SSL algorithms, but also can be combined with other algorithms.  
- For the new SSL problems of increased classes where the conventional methods cannot be applied, the proposed SSL method does not show any performance degradation even for the out-of-class data.  
- SST does not require many hyper-parameters and can be easily implemented.  
- SST is more suitable for lifelong learning compared to other SSL algorithms.

# 2 BACKGROUND

In this section, we introduce the background of our research. First, we introduce the methods of self-training (McLachlan, 1975; Zhu, 2007; Zhu & Goldberg, 2009) on which our work is based. Then we describe consistency regularization-based algorithms such as temporal ensembling (Laine & Aila, 2016) and Smooth Neighbors on Teacher Graphs (SNTG) (Luo et al., 2017).

# 2.1 SELF-TRAINING

The self-training method has long been used for semi-supervised learning (McLachlan, 1975; Zhu, 2007; Zhu & Goldberg, 2009). Self-training is an iterative process, where an algorithm sets a pseudolabels which have been classified in the previous iteration (Chapelle et al., 2009). An overview of the self-training process is as follows:

1. train a model with labeled data  
2. predict the unlabeled data with the learned model  
3. retrain the model with labeled data and all the predicted unlabeled data  
4. repeat the above process

Since our proposed algorithm is based on self-training, it may be helpful to look at our overview in Figure 1. Self-training is easy to implement and apply to various data. However, the addition of erroneous data can spoil the network. As shown in Figure 1, there are cases where a circle is predicted as blue or green in the unlabeled dataset. In self-training, these circles will be trained incorrectly. Furthermore, other classes with different distribution such as star can be trained to green.

# 2.2 CONSISTENCY REGULARIZATION

Consistency regularization is one of the popular SSL methods, and many recent researches have been conducted (Laine & Aila, 2016; Miyato et al., 2017; Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017). Among

Figure 1: An overview of the proposed SST. Different shapes represent the input data with different underlying distribution, and different colors (orange, blue, and green) are for different classes. In the initial training dataset, only three classes with their corresponding distributions  $(\bigcirc, \square, \triangle)$  exist and are used for initial training. Then the unlabeled data which include unseen distribution  $(\star, \ddagger)$  are inputted to the classification as well as the selection network. At the bottom right, unlabeled samples with higher selection network output values than a certain threshold are denoted by yellow and selected to be included in the training process for the next iteration, while the remaining are not used for training.

them,  $\Pi$  model and temporal ensembling are widely used (Laine & Aila, 2016). They defined new types of loss functions for unlabeled data. The  $\Pi$  model outputs  $f(x)$  and  $f(\hat{x})$  according to input  $x$  through different random noise and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), and minimizes the difference between these values. Temporal ensembling does not make different predictions  $f(x)$  and  $f(\hat{x})$ , but minimizes the difference between the previous output  $f_{t-1}(x)$  and the current one  $f_t(x)$  for computational efficiency. These methods have greatly improved performance. However, there are lots of things to consider for training, and it is difficult to optimize each hyper-parameter. These methods have various hyper-parameters such as 'ramp up', 'ramp down', 'unsupervised loss weight' and so on. In addition, customized settings for training such as ZCA preprocessing and mean-only batch normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016) are also very important aspects for improving the performance (Odena et al., 2018).

# 3 METHOD

In this section, we introduce our selective self-training (SST) method. Figure 1 shows an overview of the proposed SST method, which can be represented in four steps. First, SST trains the model using the labeled dataset by an ordinary supervised learning method. The next step is to predict all the unlabeled data and select a partial set of data which has high confidence with the current trained model. In doing so, the confidence is outputted by a separate selection network. Then, the selected data is added to the training dataset by labeling it as estimated. Finally, the model is re-trained with the new training dataset. The overall process of SST is described in Algorithm 1 and the details of each of the four phases will be described later.

The proposed architecture consists of a backbone network, a classification network and a selection network as shown in the lower part of Figure 1. Conventionally, the classification network is connected to the backbone network. We additionally adopt a selection network connected to the backbone network.

# 3.1 SUPERVISED LEARNING

The SST algorithm first trains a model with supervised learning. At this time, not only the backbone network and the classification network but also the selection network are trained. The classification network  $f_{cl}$  is trained in the same way as the basic classification method. We use the softmax function for the final activations and cross entropy for the loss. The selection network learns as follows. The labels for training the selection network is obtained through an adversarial way motivated by generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Yoo et al., 2017). An  $i$ -th sample  $J_{i}$  with a class label  $l_{i}$  is fed into the classification network  $f_{cl}$ . Then the class label for the selection network is set as:

$$
s _ {i} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1, & \text {i f} r _ {i} = l _ {i} \\ 0, & \text {e l s e}, \end{array} \right. \tag {1}
$$

where  $r_i$  represents the output of the classification network, i.e.,  $r_i = \arg \max f_{cl}(J_i)$ . The selection network is trained based on  $s_i$ , which is a fully connected network that takes outputs of the final layer of the backbone network  $f_n$  as inputs. We use the sigmoid function for the final activations and binary cross entropy for the loss. If the top-1 output value of the classification network is the same as the ground truth label i.e.,  $s_i = 1$ , it is set to the label to be added. Otherwise, the sample is not used for the next iteration of training. Our final loss function is a sum of the classification loss  $(L_{cl})$  and the selection loss  $(L_{sel})$ :

$$
L _ {t o t a l} = L _ {c l} + L _ {s e l}. \tag {2}
$$

# 3.2 PREDICTION AND SELECTION

After learning in a supervised manner, SST performs predictions of unlabeled dataset. While so, SST not only predicts scores for the class candidates, but also outputs a value from the selection network. If the value exceeds a certain threshold, the data is added to the training set. It is very important to set the threshold, because it determines the quality of the added unlabeled samples for the next training. During training, if the classifier network works appropriately, training accuracy will be high and the score  $s_i$  will have a value close to 1. Therefore, the threshold is set to  $1 - \epsilon$  and the data quality can be controlled by changing  $\epsilon$ .

SST makes use of the previous selection score by taking ensemble of the previous selection score and the current one, which can prevent sudden changes over iterations. In the ensemble process, for each sample, the predicted label of the previous iteration can be compared with the current predicted

label. If this value is different, the ensemble confidence is set to 0 and the sample is excluded from the candidate training set. The detailed ensemble process is described in line 6 to 9 of Algorithm 1.

# 3.3 NEW TRAINING DATASET

After performing the prediction, we add additional selected data to the new training dataset. However, just before adding selected data, we control the number of added samples in consideration of the balance among classes. The amount of added data depends on the distribution of each data. For example, a rigid body such as cars would have a smaller variation than a non-rigid body such as people. In this case, the additional dataset would contain more cars than people. If one class dominates the dataset, the model tends to overfit. Therefore, we balance the number of added samples by adjusting the number of samples for each class to be the fewest number for a class. For other classes, we randomly sample the data and add them to the additional dataset.

# 3.4 RE-TRAINING

After combining the additional data and the existing training dataset to a new training dataset, the model is trained with the new dataset. This process is repeated iteratively.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we conduct two types of experiments. First, we evaluate the proposed SST algorithm for the conventional SSL problems of the fixed classes using in-class unlabeled data. Then, SST is tested for the new SSL problems of the increased classes using out-of-class unlabeled data. For comparison with other works, the basic experimental setup was implemented in the same way as the original works, and also the same network structure as in (Laine & Aila, 2016; Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) was used. Detailed architectures can be found in the supplementary materials.

The basic settings of our experiments are as follows. Different from (Laine & Aila, 2016; Luo et al., 2017), we use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a weight decay of 0.0005 as an optimizer. Also, we do not use mean-only batch normalization layer (Salimans & Kingma, 2016) and Gaussian noise. For supervised learning with labeled data, we first trained the model for 300 epochs. After that, we trained the network for 150 epochs with a new training dataset. The learning rate is reduced by 0.1 from  $10^{-1}$  to  $10^{-3}$  in the step decay mode. In 300 epoch training, it decreased by 0.1 at 150 epoch and 225 epoch. In 150 epoch training, it decreased by 0.1 at 75 epoch and 113 epoch. Our supervised learning results in a slightly higher performance than the ones reported in other papers (Laine & Aila, 2016; Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Luo et al., 2017) because of different settings such as Gaussian noise of inputs, optimizer, mean only batch normalization and learning rate.

# 4.1 CONVENTIONAL SSL PROBLEMS OF FIXED CLASSES WITH IN-CLASS UNLAGELED DATA

In this setting, since all the classes of the unlabeled data are included in the labeled data, we decreased selection threshold  $(1 - \epsilon)$  as the iteration goes on. The values for  $\epsilon$  were increased from  $10^{-5}$  to  $10^{-2}$  in a log scale for all the datasets except for synthetic ones.

We experiment with a couple of simple synthetic datasets (two moons, four spins) and three popular datasets which are CIFAR-10, SVHN and CIFAR-100 (Netzer et al., 2011; Krizhevsky et al., 2014). The settings of labeled vs. unlabeled data separation for each dataset are shown in Table 1. The results of the synthetic datasets can be found in the supplementary material.

'balance' denotes the usage of data balancing scheme during data addition as described in Sec. 3.3, 'ensemble' is for the usage of previous selection scores as in the 9th line of Algorithm 1, and 'multiplication' is the scheme of multiplying top-1 softmax output of the classifier network to the selection score and use it as a new selection score.

# 4.1.1 ABLATION STUDY

We performed experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset with three types of ablations. As described in Table 2, these are whether to use data balancing scheme described in Section 3.3 (balance), whether to use selection score ensemble in the 9th line of Algorithm 1 (ensemble) and whether to multiply the selection score with the top-1 softmax output of the classifier network to set a new selection score for comparison with the threshold (multiplication). First, when SST did not use all of these, the error  $21.44\%$  was lower than that of supervised learning which did not use unlabeled data. This is because the model is spoiled by the added data as described in subsection 3.3. When the data balance is used, the error is  $14.43\%$ , which is better than the baseline of supervised learning. Adding the ensemble scheme results in  $11.82\%$  error, and the multiplication scheme shows a slight drop in performance. Since all of the experiments use the same threshold, the number of candidate samples to be added is reduced by the multiplication with the top-1 softmax output and the variation becomes smaller because only confident data are added. However, we have not used the multiplication scheme in what follows because the softmax classification output is dominant in multiplication. Therefore, we used only balance and ensemble schemes in the following experiments.

# 4.1.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Table 3 shows the results of supervised learning, conventional SSL algorithms and the proposed SST on CIFAR-10, SVHN and CIFAR-100 datasets. For all the datasets, we have also performed experiments of combining SST with the temporal ensembling (TempEns) as well as SNTG. For the TempEns+SNTG, the pseudo-label of SST's last iteration was used as if it were the true class label. Figure 2 shows the number of samples used in the training and the corresponding accuracy on the test set for each dataset.

CIFAR-10: When supervised learning was trained with 4,000 images, the test error was  $18.97\%$ , while it was  $5.58\%$  with 50,000 labeled images. The test error in the SST algorithm is  $11.82\%$ , which is comparable to other algorithms. The combined SST+TempEns+SNTG results in a test error of  $9.99\%$  which is  $1.83\%$  better than SST only case. As stated before, TempEns+SNTG was applied once after SST had completed in our experiment. Unlike this, if SST were trained with

TempEns+SNTG in every iteration, SST could have obtained better performance. However, this method requires enormous training time and we could not experiment this setting.

SVHN: When supervised learning was trained with 1,000 images, the test error was  $13.45\%$ . SST has an error of  $6.88\%$  which is relatively higher than those of other SSL algorithms. This is due to the inherent characteristics of the dataset. Unlike other datasets, SVHN dataset is not well balanced. On the other hand, the SST algorithm increases the volume of data with balance as mentioned in Section 3.3. The smallest class contains about 5,000 images in SVHN, and SST has not learned more than 50,000 images during learning. For this reason, the performance is lower than other algorithms. SST with TempEns+SNTG shows  $4.74\%$  error, which is better than that of SST-only case but is worse than TempEns+SNTG. Since SVHN is a relatively easy dataset, the accuracy seems to be easily saturated. As shown in Figure 2, in CIFAR-10, as data increases, the accuracy is not fully saturated. On the other hand, SVHN is saturated, and there is no performance improvement when data are added at last iterations. We think this is owing to the use of hard labels in SST where incorrectly estimated samples deteriorate the performance.

CIFAR-100 : We had an error of  $40.24\%$  with supervised learning only, and an error of  $35.2\%$  when SST was performed. The performance improvement was about  $5\%$ . As one can see in the Figure 2, the CIFAR-100 dataset has not been saturated yet. If SST is trained more with a lower threshold, SST may get better performance. We observed that performance was lower than TempEns when we used TempEns+SNTG together. Also, when TempEns+SNTG were added to SST, performance dropped slightly  $^{2}$ . The reason for this can be conjectured that the hyper-parameter in the current temporal ensembling and SNTG may not have been optimized.

# 4.2 NEW SSL PROBLEMS OF INCREASED CLASSES WITH OUT-OF-CLASS UNLAGELED DATA

We experimented with the following settings for real applications. In CIFAR-10, each 400 images of 6 animal classes are used as the labeled data and the other 20,000 data are used as unlabeled ones. In CIFAR-100, each 100 images of 50 animal classes are used as the labeled data and 20,000 unlabeled data are used. Unlike the experimental setting in (Odena et al., 2018), we experiment according to the ratio (\%) of out-of-class data in the unlabeled set. More details are in supplementary material.

Figure 3 shows the average of the results obtained by performing SST 5 times for each ratio in CIFAR-10. As shown in Figure 3(a), as the number of iterations increases, the threshold decreases and data increases gradually. Obviously,  $0 \sim 75\%$  of the non-animal data and  $100\%$  of the non-animal data show different trends. In case of  $0 \sim 75\%$ , the data shows a slight increase from  $30 \sim 40$  iterations. On the other hand, in the case of  $100\%$ , data is added little by little from  $55 \sim 65$  iterations. This tendency has been observed in many previous researches on classification (Viola & Jones, 2001; Zhang & Viola, 2008) and we applied a fixed threshold in a similar way. We have set the fixed threshold to the threshold at 47th iteration. To prevent data being added suddenly, no data was added until 5 iterations.

CIFAR-10: Table 4 shows performance according to non-animal ratio. In the case of SST (decay), the performance is improved at  $0\%$ , but at  $100\%$ , the performance is degraded as in other algorithms. On the other hand, in the case of SST (fixed), samples are not added much and performance was improved at  $100\%$  non-animal ratio as shown in Figure 3(c). Furthermore, at  $0\%$ , there was a more performance improvement than  $100\%$ , but less performance improvement than decay. Because less but stable data are added by fixed SST, the performance is improved for all the cases compared to that of supervised learning. Therefore, it is more suitable for real applications where the origin of data is unknown.

CIFAR-100 : The fixed threshold at CIFAR-100 is the threshold value at 35 iterations. In the decay mode, the performance is much improved at  $0\%$ , and at  $100\%$ , the performance is degraded. On the other hand, in the fixed mode, there was no performance degradation from  $0\%$  to  $100\%$ . In CIFAR-100, the difference between  $0\%$  and  $100\%$  is less than CIFAR-10, because the gap between animal and non-animal is small and additional data is small. More details are in supplementary material.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We proposed selective self-training (SST) for semi-supervised learning (SSL) problem. Unlike conventional methods, SST selectively samples unlabeled data and trains the model with a subset of the dataset. Using selection network, reliable samples can be added to the new training dataset. In this paper, We conduct two types of experiments. First, we experiment with the assumption that unlabeled data are in-class like conventional SSL problems. Then, we experiment how SST performs for out-of-class unlabeled data.

For the conventional SSL problems, we achieved competitive results on several datasets and our method could be combined with conventional algorithms to improve performance. The accuracy of SST is either saturated or not depending on the dataset. Nonetheless, SST have shown performance improvements as number of data increases. In addition, the results of the combined experiments of SST and other algorithms show the possibility of performance improvement.

For the new SSL problems, SST did not show any performance degradation even if the model is learned from in-class data and out-of-class unlabeled data. Decreasing the threshold of the selection network in new SSL problem, performance degrades like other algorithms. However, the output of the selection network shows different trends according to in-class and out-of-class. By setting a threshold that does not add out-of-class data, SST have prevented the addition of out-of-class samples to the new training dataset. It means that it is possible to prevent the erroneous data from being added to the unlabeled dataset in a real environment.
