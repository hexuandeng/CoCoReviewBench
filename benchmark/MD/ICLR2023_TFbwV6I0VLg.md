# ABSTRACT

Understanding dynamics from visual observations is a challenging problem that requires disentangling individual objects from the scene and learning their interactions. While recent object-centric models can successfully decompose a scene into objects, modeling their dynamics effectively still remains a challenge. We address this problem by introducing SlotFormer – a Transformer-based autoregressive model operating on learned object-centric representations. Given a video clip, our approach reasons over object features to model spatio-temporal relationships and predicts accurate future object states. In this paper, we successfully apply SlotFormer to perform video prediction on datasets with complex object interactions. Moreover, the unsupervised SlotFormer's dynamics model can be used to improve the performance on supervised downstream tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), and goal-conditioned planning. Compared to past works on dynamics modeling, our method achieves significantly better long-term synthesis of object dynamics, while retaining high quality visual generation. Besides, SlotFormer enables VQA models to reason about the future without object-level labels, even outperforming counterparts that use ground-truth annotations. Finally, we show its ability to serve as a world model for model-based planning, which is competitive with methods designed specifically for such tasks. Additional results and details are available at our Website.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The ability to understand complex systems and interactions between its elements is a key component of intelligent systems. Learning the dynamics of a multi-object systems from visual observations entails capturing object instances, their appearance, position and motion, and simulating their spatiotemporal interactions. Both in robotics (Finn et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018) and computer vision (Shi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017), unsupervised learning of dynamics has been a central problem due to its important practical implications. Obtaining a faithful dynamics model of the environment enables future prediction, planning and, crucially, allows to transfer the dynamics knowledge to improve downstream supervised tasks, such as visual reasoning (Chen et al., 2020b; Ding et al., 2021b), planning (Sun et al., 2022) and model-based control (Micheli et al., 2022). Yet, an effective domain-independent approach for unsupervised visual dynamics learning from video remains elusive.

One approach to visual dynamics modeling is to frame it as a prediction problem directly in the pixel space (Shi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Denton & Fergus, 2018). This paradigm builds on global frame-level representations, and uses dense feature maps of past frames to predict future features. By design, such models are object-agnostic, treating background and foreground modeling as equal. This frequently results in poorly learned object dynamics, producing unrealistic future predictions over longer horizons (Oprea et al., 2020). Another perspective to dynamics learning is through object-centric dynamics models (Kosiorek et al., 2018; van Steenkiste et al., 2018; Kossen et al., 2019). This class of methods first represents a scene as a set of object-centric features (a.k.a. slots), and then learns the interactions among the slots to model scene dynamics. As a result, decomposing a scene into objects and learning their interactions allows for more natural dynamics modeling and leads to more faithful simulation (Veerapaneni et al., 2020; Zoran et al., 2021). To achieve this goal, earlier object-centric models bake in strong scene (Jiang et al., 2019) or object (Lin et al., 2020) priors in their frameworks, while more recent methods (Kipf et al., 2019; Zoran et al., 2021) learn object interactions purely from data, with the aid of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Battaglia

et al., 2018) or Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Yet, these approaches independently model the per-frame object interactions and their temporal evolution, using different networks. This suggests that a simpler and more effective dynamics model is yet to be designed.

In this work, we argue that learning a system's dynamics from video effectively requires two key components: i) strong unsupervised object-centric representations (to capture objects in each frame) and ii) a powerful dynamical module (to simulate spatio-temporal interactions between the objects). To this end, we propose SlotFormer: an elegant and effective Transformer-based object-centric dynamics model, which builds upon object-centric features (Kipf et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2022), and requires no human supervision. We treat dynamics modeling as a sequential learning problem: given a sequence of input images, SlotFormer takes in the object-centric representations extracted from these frames, and predicts the object features in the future steps. By conditioning on multiple frames, our method is capable of capturing the spatio-temporal object relationships simultaneously, thus ensuring consistency of object properties and motion in the synthesized frames. We evaluate SlotFormer on four video datasets consisting of diverse object dynamics. Our method not only presents competitive results on standard video prediction metrics, but also achieves significant gains when evaluating on object-aware metrics in the long range. Crucially, we demonstrate that SlotFormer's unsupervised dynamics knowledge can be successfully transferred to downstream supervised tasks (e.g., VQA and goal-conditional planning) to improve their performance "for free". In summary, this work makes the following contributions:

1. SlotFormer: a Transformer-based model for object-centric visual simulation;  
2. SlotFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video prediction datasets, with significant advantage in modeling long-term dynamics;  
3. SlotFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on two VQA datasets and competitive results in one planning task, when equipped with a corresponding task-specific readout module.

# 2 RELATED WORK

In this section, we provide a brief overview of related works on physical reasoning, object-centric models and Transformers, which is further expanded in Appendix A.

Dynamics modeling and intuitive physics. Video prediction methods treat dynamics modeling as an image translation problem (Shi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Denton & Fergus, 2018; Lee et al., 2018), and model changes in the pixel space. However, methods that model dynamics using global image-level features usually struggle with long-horizon predictions. Some approaches leverage local priors (Finn et al., 2016; Ebert et al., 2017), or extra input information (Walker et al., 2016; Villegas et al., 2017), which only help in the short term. More recent works improve modeling visual dynamics using explicit object-centric representations. Several works directly learn deep models in the abstracted state space of objects (Wu et al., 2015; Battaglia et al., 2016; Fragkiadaki et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2016). However, they require ground-truth physical properties for training, which is unrealistic for visual dynamics simulation. Instead, recent works use object features from a supervised detector as the base representation for visual simulation (Ye et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Qi et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2022) with a GNN-based dynamics model. In contrast to the above works, our model is completely unsupervised; SlotFormer belongs to the class of models that learn both object discovery and scene dynamics without supervision. We review this class of models below.

Unsupervised object-centric representation learning from videos. Our work builds upon recent efforts in decomposing raw videos into temporally aligned slots (Kipf et al., 2021; Kabra et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2022). Earlier works often make strong assumptions on the underlying object representations. Jiang et al. (2019) explicitly decompose the scene into foreground and background to apply fixed object size and presence priors. Lin et al. (2020) further disentangle object features to represent object positions, depth and semantic attributes separately. Some methods leverage the power of GNNs or Transformers to eliminate these domain-specific priors (Veerapaneni et al., 2020; van Steenkiste et al., 2018; Creswell et al., 2021; Zoran et al., 2021). However, they still model the object interactions and temporal scene dynamics using separate modules; and set the context window of the recurrent dynamics module to only a single timestep. The most relevant work to ours is OCVT (Wu et al., 2021), which also applies Transformers to slots from multiple frames. However, OCVT utilizes manually disentangled object features, and needs Hungarian matching for latent alignment during training. Therefore, it still underperforms RNN-based baselines in the video

Figure 1: SlotFormer architecture overview. Taking multiple video frames  $\{\pmb{x}_t\}_{t=1}^T$  as input, we first extract object slots  $\{S_t\}_{t=1}^T$  using the pretrained object-centric model. Then, slots are linearly projected and added with temporal positional encoding. The resulting tokens are fed to the Transformer module to generate future slots  $\{\hat{S}_{T+k}\}_{k=1}^K$  in an autoregressive manner.

prediction task. In contrast, SlotFormer is a general Transformer-based dynamics model which is agnostic to the underlying object-centric representations. It performs joint spatio-temporal reasoning over object slots simultaneously, enabling consistent long-term dynamics modeling.

Transformers for sequential modeling. Inspired by the success of autoregressive Transformers in language modeling (Radford et al., 2018; 2019; Brown et al., 2020), they were adapted to video generation tasks (Yan et al., 2021; Ren & Wang, 2022; Micheli et al., 2022; Nash et al., 2022). To handle the high dimensionality of images, these methods often adopt a two-stage training strategy by first mapping images to discrete tokens (Esser et al., 2021), and then learning a Transformer over tokens. However, since they operate on a regular image grid, the mapping ignores the boundary of objects and usually splits one object into multiple tokens. In this work, we learn a Transformer-based dynamics model over slot-based representations that capture the entire object in a single vector, thus generating more consistent future object states as will be shown in the experiments.

# 3 SLOTFORMER: OBJECT-ORIENTED DYNAMICS LEARNING

In this section, we describe our Transformer-based autoregressive model for dynamics learning. Taking  $T$  video frames as inputs, SlotFormer first leverages a pre-trained object-centric model to extract object features (a.k.a. slots) from each frame (Section 3.1). These slots are then forwarded to the Transformer module for joint spatio-temporal reasoning, and used to predict future slots (Section 3.2). The whole pipeline is trained by minimizing reconstruction loss in both feature and image space (Section 3.3). We show the overall model architecture in Figure 1.

# 3.1 SLOT-BASED OBJECT-CENTRIC REPRESENTATION

We build on the Slot Attention architecture to extract slots from videos due to their strong performance in unsupervised object discovery. Given  $T$  input frames  $\{\pmb{x}_t\}_{t=1}^T$ , our object-centric model first extracts image features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder, then adds positional encodings, and flattens them into a set of vectors  $\pmb{h}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times D_{enc}}$ , where  $M$  is the size of the flattened feature grid and  $D_{enc}$  is the feature dimension. Then, the model initializes  $N$  slots  $\tilde{S}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D_{slot}}$  from a set of learnable vectors  $(t = 1)$ , and performs Slot Attention (Locatello et al., 2020) to update the slot representations as  $\mathcal{S}_t = f_{SA}(\tilde{S}_t, \pmb{h}_t)$ . Here,  $f_{SA}$  binds slots to objects via iterative Scaled Dot-Product Attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), encouraging scene decomposition. To

achieve temporal alignment of slots,  $\tilde{S}_t$  for  $t\geq 2$  is initialized as  $\tilde{S}_t = f_{trans}(\mathcal{S}_{t - 1})$ , where  $f_{trans}$  is the transition function implemented as a Transformer encoder.

Before training the Transformer-based dynamics model, we first pre-train the object-centric model using reconstruction loss on videos from the target dataset. This ensures the learned slots can accurately capture both foreground objects and background environment of the scene.

# 3.2 DYNAMICS PREDICTION WITH AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSFORMER

Overview. Given slots  $\{\mathcal{S}_t\}_{t=1}^T$  extracted from  $T$  video frames, SlotFormer is able to synthesize a sequence of future slots  $\{\mathcal{S}_{T+k}\}_{k=1}^K$  for any given horizon  $K$ . Our model operates by alternating between two steps: i) feed the slots into a Transformer that performs joint spatio-temporal reasoning and predicts slots at the next timestep,  $\hat{S}_{t+1}$ , ii) feed the predicted slots back into the Transformer to keep generating future rollout autoregressively. See Figure 1 for the pipeline overview.

Architecture. To build the SlotFormer's dynamics module,  $\mathcal{T}$ , we adopt the standard Transformer encoder module with  $N_{\mathcal{T}}$  layers. To match the inner dimensionality  $D_{e}$  of  $\mathcal{T}$ , we linearly project the input sequence of slots to a latent space  $G_{t} = \mathrm{Linear}(S_{t}) \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D_{e}}$ . To indicate the order of input slots, we add positional encoding (P.E.) to the latent embeddings. A naive solution would be to add a sinusoidal positional encoding to every slot regardless of its timestep, as done in Ding et al. (2021a). However, this would break the permutation equivariance among slots, which is a useful property of our model. Therefore, we only apply positional encoding at the temporal level, such that the slots at the same timestep receive the same positional encoding:

$$
V = \left[ G _ {1}, G _ {2}, \dots , G _ {T} \right] + \left[ P _ {1}, P _ {2}, \dots , P _ {T} \right], \tag {1}
$$

where  $V \in \mathbb{R}^{(TN) \times D_e}$  is the resulting input to the transformer  $\mathcal{T}$  and  $P_t \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D_e}$  denotes the sinusoidal positional encoding duplicated  $N$  times. As we will show in the ablation study, the temporal positional encoding enables better prediction results despite having fewer parameters.

Now, we can utilize the Transformer  $\mathcal{T}$  to reason about the dynamics of the scene. Denote the Transformer output features as  $U = [U_{1}, U_{2}, \dots, U_{T}] \in \mathbb{R}^{(TN) \times D_{e}}$ , we take the last  $N$  features  $U_{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D_{e}}$  and feed them to a linear layer to obtain the predicted slots at timestep  $T + 1$ :

$$
U = \mathcal {T} (V), \quad \hat {\mathcal {S}} _ {T + 1} = \operatorname {L i n e a r} \left(U _ {T}\right). \tag {2}
$$

For consequent future predictions,  $\hat{S}_{T + 1}$  will be treated as the ground-truth slots along with  $\{S_t\}_{t = 2}^T$  to predict  $\hat{S}_{T + 2}$ . In this way, the Transformer can be applied autoregressively to generate any given number,  $K$ , of future frames, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Remark. The SlotFormer's architecture allows to preserve temporal consistency among slots at different timesteps. To realize such consistency, we employ residual connections from  $S_{t}$  to  $\hat{S}_{t + 1}$ , which forces the Transformer  $\mathcal{T}$  to apply refinement to the slots while preserving their absolute order. Owing to this order invariance, SlotFormer can be used to reason about individual object's dynamics for long-term rollout, and can be seamlessly integrated with downstream task models.

# 3.3 MODEL TRAINING

In contrast to prior research that predicts image tokens one by one with a causal attention mask in GPT-style, we generate all the slots at the next timestep in parallel. Therefore, we do not need the teacher forcing strategy (Radford et al., 2018) for training. Instead, we train the model using the predicted slots as inputs. This simulates the error accumulation process in long-term sequence generation, and improves the quality of the generated videos, as we will show in our experiments.

For training, we use a slot reconstruction loss (in  $L_{2}$ ) denoted as:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {S} = \frac {1}{K \cdot N} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \left\| \hat {\boldsymbol {s}} _ {T + k} ^ {n} - \boldsymbol {s} _ {T + k} ^ {n} \right\| ^ {2}. \tag {3}
$$

When using SAVi as the object-centric model, we also employ an image reconstruction loss to promote prediction of consistent object attributes such as colors and shapes. The predicted slots are decoded to images by the frozen SAVi decoder  $f_{dec}$ , and then matched to the original frames as:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {I} = \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \left| \left| f _ {\text {d e c}} \left(\hat {\mathcal {S}} _ {T + k}\right) - \boldsymbol {x} _ {T + k} \right| \right| ^ {2}. \tag {4}
$$

The final objective function is a weighted combination of the two losses with a hyper-parameter  $\lambda$ :

$$
\mathcal {L} = \mathcal {L} _ {S} + \lambda \mathcal {L} _ {I}. \tag {5}
$$

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

SlotFormer is a generic architecture for many tasks requiring object-oriented reasoning. We evaluate the dynamics modeling capability of SlotFormer in three such tasks: video prediction, VQA and action planning. Our experiments aim to answer the following questions: (1) Can an autoregressive Transformer operating on slots generate future frames with both high visual quality and accurate object dynamics? (Section 4.2) (2) Are the future states synthesized by SlotFormer useful for reasoning in VQA? (Section 4.3) (3) How well can SlotFormer serve as a world model for planning actions? (Section 4.4) Finally, we perform an ablation study of SlotFormer's components in Section 4.5.

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Datasets. We evaluate our method's capability in video prediction on two datasets,  $OBJ3D$  (Lin et al., 2020) and CLEVRER (Yi et al., 2019), and demonstrate its ability for downstream reasoning and planning tasks on three datasets, CLEVRER, Physion (Bear et al., 2021) and PHYRE (Bakhtin et al., 2019). We briefly introduce each dataset below, which are further detailed in Appendix B.

OBJ3D consists of CLEVR-like (Johnson et al., 2017) dynamic scenes, where a sphere is launched from the front of the scene to collide with other still objects. There are 2,920 videos for training and 200 videos for testing. Following (Lin et al., 2020), we use the first 50 out of 100 frames of each video in our experiments, since most of the interactions end before 50 steps.

CLEVRER is similar to OBJ3D but with smaller objects and varying entry points throughout the video, making it more challenging. For video prediction evaluation, we follow Zoran et al. (2021) to subsample the video by a factor of 2, resulting in a length of 64. We also filter out video clips where there are newly entered objects during the rollout period. For VQA task, CLEVRER provides four types of questions: descriptive, explanatory, predictive and counterfactual. The predictive questions require the model to simulate future interactions of objects such as collisions. Therefore, we focus on the accuracy improvement on predictive questions by using SlotFormer's future rollout.

Physion is a VQA dataset containing realistic simulation of eight physical phenomena. Notably, Physion features diverse object entities and environments, making physical reasoning more difficult than previous synthetic VQA benchmarks. The goal of this dataset is to predict whether a red agent object will contact with a yellow patient object when the scene evolves. Following the official evaluation protocol, all models are first trained using unsupervised future prediction loss, then used to perform rollout on test scenes, where a linear readout model is applied to predict the answer.

PHYRE is a physical reasoning benchmark consisting of 2D physical puzzles. We use the BALL-tier, where the goal is to place a red ball at a certain location, such that the green ball will eventually come in contact with the blue/purple object, after the scene is unrolled in time. Following Qi et al. (2020), we treat SlotFormer as the world model and build a task success classifier on predicted object states as the scoring function. Then, we use it to rank a pre-defined 10,000 actions from Bakhtin et al. (2019), and execute them accordingly. We experiment on the within-template setting.

Implementation Details. We first pre-train the object-centric model on each dataset, and then extract slots for training SlotFormer. We employ SAVi (Kipf et al., 2021) on OBJ3D, CLEVRER, PHYRE, and STEVE (Singh et al., 2022) on Physion to extract object-centric features. We discovered that vanilla SAVi cannot properly handle some videos on CLEVRER. So we also introduce a stochastic version of SAVi to solve this problem, which is described in the Appendix. We list common variations in network architectures and hyper-parameters in Appendix C.

# 4.2 EVALUATION ON VIDEO PREDICTION

In this subsection, we evaluate SlotFormer's ability to model object dynamics from video, predict their future positions and attributes, and generate future video frames.

Baselines. We compare our approach with four baselines which are further described in Appendix D. We use a video prediction model PredRNN (Wang et al., 2017) that generates future frames based on global image features as our first baseline. To verify the effectiveness of slot representation, we train a VQ-VAE (Razavi et al., 2019) to tokenize images, and replace the slot input in SlotFormer with

patch tokens, denoted as VQFormer. We also adopt the state-of-the-art generative object-centric model  $G$ -SWM (Lin et al., 2020), which applies heavy priors in their model. Finally, since the PARTS (Zoran et al., 2021) code is unreleased, we incorporate their Transformer-LSTM dynamics module into SAVi (denoted as SAVi-dyn) and train the model using the setup of Zoran et al. (2021).

Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate the visual quality of the videos, we report PSNR, SSIM (Wang et al., 2004) and LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018). As discussed in Sara et al. (2019), LPIPS captures better perceptual similarity with human than PSNR and SSIM. We focus our comparison on LPIPS, while reporting others for completeness. It is worth noting that neither of these metrics evaluate semantics in predicted frames (Yu et al., 2022). To evaluate the predicted object dynamics, we use the per-slot object masks predicted by the SAVi decoder and compare them to the ground-truth segmentation mask; same for the corresponding bounding box. We calculate the Average Recall (AR) of the predicted object boxes, and the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), the foreground variant of ARI and mIoU termed FG-ARI and FG-mIoU of the predicted masks. We unroll the model for 44 and 42 steps on OBJ3D and CLEVRER, respectively, and report metrics averaged over timesteps.

Results on visual quality. Table 1 presents the results on visual quality of the generated videos. SlotFormer outperforms all baselines with a sizeable margin in terms of LPIPS, and achieves competitive results on PSNR and SSIM. We note that PSNR and SSIM are poor metrics in this setting. For example, PredRNN and SAVi-dyn score highly in these two metrics despite producing blurry

objects (see Figure 3). In contrast, SlotFormer generates objects with consistent attributes throughout the rollout, which we attribute to modeling dynamics in the object-centric space, rather than in the frames directly. This is also verified in the per-step LPIPS results in Figure 2 (left). Since SlotFormer relies on pretrained slots, the reconstructed images at earlier steps have lower quality than baselines. Nevertheless, it achieves clear advantage at longer horizon, demonstrating superior long-term modeling ability. Although VQFormer is also able to generate sharp images, it fails to predicts correct dynamics and object attributes, as also observed in previous works (Yan et al., 2021; Ren & Wang, 2022). This shows that only a strong decoder (i.e.  $VQ$ -VAE) to generate realistic images is not sufficient for learning dynamics. See Appendix E.1 for more qualitative results on both datasets.

Results on object dynamics. Here, we evaluate the quality of object bounding boxes and segmentation masks, decoded from the models' future predictions. The accuracy of the predicted object boxes and segmentation masks is summarized in Table 2 (right). Since OBJ3D lacks such annotations, and PredRNN, VQFormer cannot generate object-level outputs, we exclude it from evaluation. SlotFormer achieves the best performance on AR, ARI and FG-mIoU, and competitive results on FG-ARI. SAVi-dyn scores a high FG-ARI because its blurry predictions assign many background pixels to foreground objects, while the computation of FG-ARI ignores false positives. This is verified by its poor performance in FG-mIoU which penalizes such mistakes. We also show the per-step results in Figure 2 (right) and Appendix E.2, where our method excels at all future timesteps.

Attention map analysis. To study how SlotFormer leverages past information to predict the future, we visualize the self-attention maps from the Transformer  $\mathcal{T}$ , which is detailed in Appendix E.3.

# 4.3 VISUAL QUESTION ANSWERING

In this subsection, we show how to leverage (unsupervised) SlotFormer's future predictions to improve (supervised) predictive question answering.

Our Implementation. On CLEVRR, we choose Aloe (Ding et al., 2021a) as the base reasoning model as it can jointly process slots and texts. To answer predictive questions, we explicitly unroll SlotFormer and run Aloe on the predicted future slots. See Appendix C for more details. On Physion, since there is no language involved, we follow the official protocol by training a linear readout model on synthesized slots to predict whether the two objects contact. We design an improved readout model for object-centric representations, which is further detailed in Appendix C.

Baselines. On CLEVRR, we adopt  $DCL$  (Chen et al., 2020b) which utilizes pre-trained object detectors and a GNN-based dynamics model. We also choose the state-of-the-art model VRDP (Ding et al., 2021b), which exploits strong environmental priors to run differentiable physics engine for rollout. We report two variants of VRDP which use Slot Attention (VRDP) or pre-trained detectors  $(\mathrm{VRDP}^{\dagger})$  to detect objects. Finally, for consistency with our results, we report the performance of

Figure 5: Qualitative results on PHYRE. The goal is to place a red ball in the first frame, so that the green ball hits the blue object after rollout. We show the per-slot rollout, where SlotFormer is able to decompose the scene into individual objects, and reason their interactions to perform accurate future synthesis.

our re-implemented Aloe (dubbed as Aloe*).

On Physion, we select  $RPIN$  (Qi et al., 2020) and  $pDEIT-lstm$  (Touvron et al., 2021), since they are the only two methods where the rollout improves accuracy in the benchmark (Bear et al., 2021). RPIN is an object-centric dynamics model using ground-truth bounding boxes.  $pDEIT-lstm$  builds LSTM over ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) pre-trained DeiT model, learning the dynamics over frame features. Since the benchmark code for Physion is not released, we reproduce it to achieve similar or better results. We also report the Human results from the Physion paper for reference.

Results on CLEVRER. Table 3 presents the accuracy on predictive questions. The dynamics predicted by SlotFormer boosts the performance of Aloe by  $3.4\%$  and  $6.0\%$  in the per option (per opt.) and per question (per ques.) setting, respectively. As a fully unsupervised dynamics model, our method even outperforms previous state-of-the-art DCL and VRDP which use supervisedly trained object detectors. On the CLEVRER public leaderboard predictive question subset, we rank first in the per option setting, and second in the per question setting. Figure 4 shows an example of our predicted dynamics, where SlotFormer accurately simulates two consecutive collision events.

Results on Physion. Table 4 summarizes the readout accuracy on observation (Obs.) and observation plus rollout (Dyn.) frames. SlotFormer achieves a  $1.9\%$  improvement with learned dynamics, surpassing all the baselines. See Figure 8 in the Appendix for qualitative results.

# 4.4 ACTION PLANNING

Here, we perform goal-conditioned planning inside the SlotFormer's learned dynamics model.

Our Implementation. Since it is possible to infer the future states from only the initial configuration on PHYRE, we set the burn-in length  $T = 1$ , and apply SlotFormer to generate slots  $S_{2}$  from  $S_{1}$ . Then, instead of only using  $S_{2}$  to generate  $S_{3}$ , we feed in both  $S_{1}$  and  $S_{2}$  for better temporal consistency. We apply this iterative overlapping modeling technique (Ren & Wang, 2022), and set the maximum conditioning length as 6. To rank the actions during testing, we train a task success classifier on future states simulated by SlotFormer, which is detailed in Appendix C. We experiment on the within-template setting, and report the AUCCESSION averaged over the official 10 folds.

Baselines. We report three naive baselines from Bakhtin et al. (2019), RAND, MEM and DQN. We adopt Dec [Joint] (Girdhar et al., 2020) which employs a CNN-based future prediction model, and  $RPIN$  (Qi et al., 2020) as an object-centric dynamics model. Finally, Dynamics-Aware DQN (Ahmed

et al., 2021) (dubbed Dyn-DQN) designs a task-specific loss to inject dynamics information to the network. It is worth noting that all of the above methods use either ground-truth object masks or bounding boxes, while SlotFormer learns scene dynamics without any object-level annotations.

Results on action planning. We report the AUCCESS metric averaged over the official 10 folds of train/test splits in Table 5. As an unsupervised dynamics model, SlotFormer achieves a mean AUCCESS score of 82.0, which is on par with baselines that assume ground-truth object information as input. Figure 5 shows the entire rollout generated by our model. SlotFormer is able to capture objects with varying appearance, and simulate the dynamics of complex multi-object interactions.

# 4.5 ABLATION STUDY

In this section, we perform an ablation study to examine the importance of each component in SlotFormer on OBJ3D (Table 6) and Physion (Table 7).

Burn-in length  $T$  and rollout length  $K$ . By default, we set  $T = 6$ ,  $K = 10$  for OBJ3D, and  $T = 15$ ,  $K = 10$  for Physion. On OBJ3D, the model performance first improves with more input frames, and slightly drops when  $T$  further increases to 8. We hypothesize that this is because a history length of 6 is sufficient for the model to learn accurate dynamics on OBJ3D. On Physion, the accuracy improves consistently as we increase  $T$ , until using all the observation frames. Besides, using 10 rollout frames strikes a balance between accuracy and computation efficiency.

Transformer (Trans.) Layer  $N_{\mathcal{T}}$ . By default, we set  $N_{\mathcal{T}} = 4$  on OBJ3D and  $N_{\mathcal{T}} = 8$  on Physion. Stacking more layers harms the performance on OBJ3D due to overfitting, while improving the accuracy on Physion. This is because the dynamics on Physion is more challenging to learn. However, further increasing  $N_{\mathcal{T}}$  to 12 makes model training unstable and the loss diverging.

Positional encoding (P.E.). Using a vanilla sinusoidal positional encoding which destroys the permutation equivariance among slots results in small performance drop in terms of visual quality, and a clear degradation in VQA accuracy. This is not surprising, as permutation equivariance is a useful prior for object-centric scene modeling, which should be preserved.

Teacher forcing. We try the teacher forcing strategy (Radford et al., 2018) by taking in ground-truth slots instead of the predicted slots autoregressively during training, which degrades the results significantly. This proves that simulating error accumulation benefits long-term dynamics modeling.

Image reconstruction loss  $\mathcal{L}_I$ . As shown in the table, the auxiliary image reconstruction loss improves the quality of the generated videos drastically. As we observe empirically,  $\mathcal{L}_I$  helps preserve object attributes (e.g., color, shape), but has little effect on object dynamics. Thus, we do not apply  $\mathcal{L}_I$  on Physion, due to the large memory consumption of STEVE's slot decoder.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose SlotFormer, a Transformer-based autoregressive model that enables consistent long-term dynamics modeling with object-centric representations. SlotFormer learns complex spatio-temporal interactions between the objects and generates future predictions of high visual quality. Moreover, SlotFormer can transfer unsupervised dynamics knowledge to downstream (supervised) reasoning tasks which leads to state-of-the-art or comparable results on VQA and goal-conditioned planning. Finally, we believe that unsupervised object-centric dynamics models hold great potential for simulating complex datasets, advancing world models, and reasoning about the future with minimal supervision; and that SlotFormer is a new step towards this goal.
