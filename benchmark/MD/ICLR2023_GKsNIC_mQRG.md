# ABSTRACT

In reinforcement learning (RL), many exploration methods explicitly promote stochastic policies, e.g., by adding an entropy bonus. We argue that exploration only matters in RL because the agent repeatedly encounters the same or similar states, so that it is beneficial to gradually improve the performance over the encounters; otherwise, the greedy policy would be optimal. Based on this intuition, we propose ReMax, an objective for RL whereby stochastic exploration arises as an emergent property, without adding any explicit exploration bonus. In ReMax, an episode is modified so that the agent can reset to previous states in the trajectory, and the agent's goal is to maximize the best return in the trajectory tree. We show that this ReMax objective can be directly optimized with an unbiased policy gradient method. Experiments confirm that ReMax leads to the emergence of a stochastic exploration policy, and improves the performance compared to RL with no exploration bonus.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Exploration is widely studied in reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) (App. A). Perhaps the most popular method of exploration is to explicitly promote a stochastic policy by maximizing the entropy in addition to the cumulative reward (Williams, 1992; Ziebart et al., 2008; Mnih et al., 2016; Haarnoja et al., 2018). We note that it is non-obvious why one should add such an entropy bonus—the objective of RL is only to maximize the rewards. Such exploration methods are only retrospectively justified as they improve the performance of the algorithms. In our article, we propose a method that, paradoxically, promotes exploration by greedily maximizing the rewards.

The motivation of our method is the following: we suppose that exploration is vital in RL because the agent, intentionally or unintentionally, visits the same (or similar) state repeatedly; exploration allows the gain of some valuable information for making a better decision on the next visit to the same state. However, it has no value if the agent would never encounter the same state.

Based on this observation, we propose a new objective function for RL called ReMax that encourages exploration in a novel way. Briefly, the ReMax objective is computed as follows: while interacting with the environment, in addition to taking usual actions, the agent may choose to reset to a previously visited state in the trajectory up to some limited number of times; then, after the interaction, the value of the ReMax objective is computed as the sum of the rewards along the best trajectory.

The crucial difference between our approach and previous ones is that, while most previous approaches explicitly set the goal of obtaining a stochastic exploratory policy via an exploration bonus (e.g., state-visitation bonus or entropy bonus), in our approach, such an exploratory policy is not the explicit goal, but the optimization of the ReMax objective naturally results in an exploratory policy.

We note that several previous studies successfully utilized resetting. For example, Go-Explore (Ecofet et al., 2021), which achieved impressive results on the well-known hard-exploration problem Montezuma's Revenge, utilized resetting to rarely visited states, but also AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016) used Monte-Carlo tree search that can be regarded as a kind of resetting. In practical RL problems, resetting is often possible, such as when we have access to the environment simulator (like Go). Also, even if such simulator access is not available, we can use powerful model-based RL (MBRL) methods, e.g., DreamerV2 (Hafner et al., 2021), and use resetting in simulations with the learned model.

The main objective of this article is to confirm our hypothesis that ReMax leads to the emergence of a stochastic exploratory policy. To this end, we perform three phases of experiments:

- Step 1. We illustrate the main idea and demonstrate that optimizing the ReMax objective causes a stochastic policy in a simple bandit task (Sec. 3). This experiment was non-conclusive as the emergence of the stochastic policy relied on the partial observability of the environment.  
- Step 2. To overcome the limitation of the previous step, we demonstrate that, by optimizing the ReMax objective, a stochastic policy emerges even in a deterministic maze environment, where optimizing the regular RL objective causes the policy to become deterministic and the learning to stop (Sec. 5). The limitation here is that the example relied on a simple model parameterization.  
- Step 3. To make the scenario of the maze experiment more realistic, we modify the maze to represent the observations by images, and use a neural network function approximator (Sec. 6). This experiment indicates that the failure of the regular RL and the emergence of exploration happen in a practical deep RL scenario, even in a deterministic environment.

Finally, we also confirmed that ReMax can promote stochastic exploration in modern policy gradient algorithms, such as A2C (Mnih et al., 2016), and improve the performance in MinAtar (Young & Tian, 2019), a simplified version of the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013), where we use neural network function approximators (Sec. 8.1). We believe that ReMax is a viable competitor to classical approaches for promoting stochastic exploration, such as entropy bonuses.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

Notation. We consider an episodic Markov decision process (MDP)  $\mathcal{M}$ , defined as a tuple  $(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},P,r,\rho_0,T)$ , where the state space  $\mathcal{S}$ , the action space  $\mathcal{A}$  are discrete and  $T$  is a finite horizon. The initial state  $s_0\in \mathcal{S}$  follows the distribution  $\rho_0:\mathcal{S}\to [0,1]$ , and the state transition kernel  $P:S\times \mathcal{A}\times \mathcal{S}\rightarrow [0,1]$  defines the state transition probability from the current state  $s\in \mathcal{S}$  to the next state  $s^{\prime}\in \mathcal{S}$  after the action  $a\in \mathcal{A}$  is taken. The reward function  $r:\mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{A}\to [r_{\mathrm{min}},r_{\mathrm{max}}]$  determines the immediate reward given the state,  $s$ , and action,  $a$ . At each state,  $s$ , the agent can take a legal action  $a\in \mathcal{A}(s)\subset \mathcal{A}$ , where  $\mathcal{A}(s)$  are the legal actions at state  $s$ . The agent acts following a parameterized policy  $\pi_{\theta}:\mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{A}\to [0,1]$  with the goal of maximizing the rewards. The trajectory  $\tau \coloneqq (s_0,a_0,\dots ,s_T)$  is the sequence of state-action pairs from the current episode:  $\tau \sim \rho_{\pi}(\tau)$  where  $\rho_{\pi}(\tau)\coloneqq \rho_0(s_0)\prod_{t = 0}^{T - 1}\pi (a_t|s_t)P(s_{t + 1}|s_t,a_t)$ . Note that  $s_T$  is the terminal state. The RL objective is to maximize the expected return  $J_{\mathrm{RL}}(\pi)\coloneqq \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \rho_{\pi}}\bigl [\mathcal{R}(\tau)\bigr ]$ , where  $\mathcal{R}(\tau) = \sum_{t = 0}^{T - 1}r(s_t,a_t)$ .

Policy gradient methods. In this study, we focus on the policy gradient (PG) method, which directly optimizes a parameterized policy  $\pi_{\theta}$  via gradient ascent. The policy gradient theorem (Sutton et al., 1999) provides an expression of the PG,  $\nabla_{\theta}J_{\mathrm{RL}}(\pi_{\theta})$ , amenable for estimation. In particular, we use REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) as the simplest PG method, whose gradient estimator is given by  $\hat{g} \coloneqq \sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\nabla_{\theta}\log\pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t)(\mathcal{R}(\tau)-b_t)$ , where  $b_t$  is a constant baseline for variance reduction. This estimator is unbiased:  $\nabla_{\theta}J_{\mathrm{RL}}(\pi_{\theta}) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau}[\hat{g}]$ . One may also average a batch of  $N$  gradient estimates from different trajectories,  $\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{N}\hat{g}_i$ . A common baseline is  $b_t = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{N}\mathcal{R}(\tau)$ , the average of the returns in the batch. Another common method to reduce the variance is using the future return  $\mathcal{R}_t(\tau) \coloneqq \sum_{h=t}^{T-1}r(s_h,a_h)$ , that only includes the rewards following the action; this maintains the unbiasedness of the estimator. An important property of PG methods—and part of the reason we focus on them—is that they remain unbiased even when the system is a POMDP (partially observable MDP), i.e., unobservable hidden states characterize the state transitions. This important property is the reason that we are able to construct unbiased estimators for our proposed ReMax objective.

# 3 STEP 1: BANDIT PROBLEM EXAMPLE

In the first step of our 3-stage experiment, we illustrate the core idea behind our ReMax objective. Through a simple randomized bandit task, we explain the principle of why a stochastic policy is optimal under the ReMax objective; thus, leading to the emergence of exploration.

Problem. There are two arms, indexed by 0 and 1. At the beginning of each episode, one arm is chosen as an unobservable "correct" arm  $z \in \{0,1\}$ . The correct arm  $z \in \{0,1\}$  is randomly chosen according to a Bernoulli distribution with probability  $q = 0.75$ . In each episode, the agent plays only one arm  $a \in \{0,1\}$ . Playing the correct arm (i.e.,  $a = z$ ) gives the return 1 and 0 otherwise:  $\mathcal{R}(z,a) = \mathbb{I}_{z=a}$ , where  $\mathbb{I}_e$  takes 1 if  $e$  is true and 0 otherwise. Under the usual RL objective, which

maximizes expected return  $\mathbb{E}_{z,a}[\mathcal{R}(z,a)]$ , the optimal policy is deterministic, taking action  $a = 1$  with probability 1, which yields a maximum expected return 0.75.

ReMax objective. We define our ReMax objective on this bandit problem as:

$$
J _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} ^ {(K)} (\pi) := \mathbb {E} _ {z} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {a ^ {(1)}, \dots , a ^ {(K)}} \left[ \max  _ {k \in \{1 \dots , K \}} \mathcal {R} (z, a ^ {(k)}) | z \right] \right]. \tag {1}
$$

In this objective the agent has  $K$  chances to choose an arm, and the best of those  $K$  returns is defined as the value to optimize. For the regular RL objective, we saw that a deterministic policy was optimal; however, for the ReMax objective, a stochastic policy is optimal instead. To understand this intuitively, consider that pulling the same arm multiple times does not affect the ReMax objective, while pulling both arms guarantees pulling the correct arm, giving the return  $\max \{\mathcal{R}(z,0),\mathcal{R}(z,1)\} = 1$ . We can analytically compute the expected return in this augmented problem (App. B). The solutions are in Fig. 1 (A) where we compare the ReMax objective  $(K = 2)$  and the RL objective. We can confirm that  $\pi (a = 1) = 0.75$  maximizes the ReMax objective (shown as the black dotted line), and the optimal policy under the ReMax objective is exploratory.

Experiments. We also experimentally confirmed that, when trained to maximize the ReMax objective, a direct policy search algorithm converges to the stochastic policy rather than a deterministic one. We trained a policy with only one parameter  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$ . The probability of selecting action 1 is defined as  $\pi_{\theta}(a = 1) = \sigma(\theta)$ , where  $\sigma$  is the sigmoid function. We initialized  $\theta$  so that  $\pi_{\theta}$  distributes uniformly over  $[0,1]$ . We used  $K = 2$  in this experiment. Given a sample  $(z,a^{(1)},a^{(2)})$ , we updated  $\theta$  using  $\Delta \theta = -\alpha\left(\sum_{k=1}^{2}\nabla_{\theta}\log\pi_{\theta}(a^{(k)})\right)\left(\max_{k'\in\{1,2\}}\{\mathcal{R}(z,a^{(k')})\}\right)$ , where  $\alpha = 0.01$  is the step-size parameter. Fig. 1 (B) shows the results of this training procedure. Each line shows an average performance of 10 runs, and the shaded area indicates the standard error. We can see that the policy converges to the deterministic one under the standard RL objective, whereas the policy converges to the optimal stochastic policy under the ReMax objective as expected.

Discussion. The key insight from this bandit problem example is that if the agent can repeat the decision-making, seeking the best result in the same state, the optimal policy may be stochastic. One may think that the hidden state  $z$ , on which the emergence of the stochastic policy relies, is artificial and has nothing to do with typical MDPs. However, interestingly, we will show that a stochastic policy emerges even in a fully observable deterministic MDP (Sec. 5), due to function approximation.

# 4 REMAX WITH RESETTING IN MDPS

In preparation of stages 2 and 3 of our experiments (Secs. 5, 6), we lay the foundations of using ReMax in MDPs. In the bandit example (Sec. 3), the agent had  $K$  chances to play at the given state. However, in RL, it is not practical to act  $K$  times at each state, especially when the environment is large. To optimize the ReMax objective in a practical way, we utilize resetting and define a resettable MDP (ReMDP), where the agent has a special action to "jump" back to previously visited states in the episode, and the trajectory tree, a tree constructed by the state-action pairs in a ReMDP episode. Fig. 2 shows the idea of resetting and the trajectory tree. We define our ReMax objective over the ReMDP (Sec. 4.1) and also describe a PG method that optimizes the objective (Sec. 4.2).

# 4.1 REMAX OBJECTIVE IN MDPS

Resettable MDP. We define a ReMDP  $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{Re}} = (S, \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Re}}, P_{\mathrm{Re}}, r, \rho_0, T)$  by extending the action space and state transition kernel of the original MDP  $\mathcal{M} = (S, \mathcal{A}, P, r, \rho_0, T)$  as follows: the action

$u \in \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Re}}$  is an element of  $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Re}} \coloneqq \mathcal{A} \bigcup \mathcal{X}$ , where  $x \in \mathcal{X}$  indicates a reset action to the target state  $s_{\mathrm{Re}}(x) \in S$ . If a reset action is chosen ( $u \in \mathcal{X}$ ), the state immediately transitions to  $s_{\mathrm{Re}}(u)$ :

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {\mathrm {R e}} (s ^ {\prime} | s, u) := \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \mathbb {I} _ {s ^ {\prime} = s _ {\mathrm {R e}} (u)} & \text {i f} u \in \mathcal {X} \\ \mathrm {P} (s ^ {\prime} | s, a) & \text {i f} u = a \in \mathcal {A} \end{array} \right..
$$

However, as our motivation was to repeat decisions in the same state, the target states of resetting are limited to previously visited states in the episode: the legal actions at  $s_t$  are  $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Re}}(s_t) \coloneqq \mathcal{A}(s_t) \cup \mathcal{X}(s_t)$  such that for any  $x \in \mathcal{X}(s_t)$ ,  $s_{\mathrm{Re}}(x) \in \{s_0, \ldots, s_{t-1}\}$  holds.

Trajectory tree. Now, we can sample  $\mathcal{T} := (s_0, u_0, \ldots, s_T)$ , a trajectory on the ReMDP,  $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{Re}}$ . We call  $\mathcal{T}$  a trajectory tree because we can construct a tree, whose nodes correspond to the states  $s \in S$ , and edges correspond to the actions  $u = a \in \mathcal{A}$ . See Fig. 2 for an example trajectory tree,  $(s_0, u_0, \ldots, s_7)$ . The initial state  $s_0$  is the root node, while the states where a reset happened and the terminal states are the leaf nodes.

Figure 2: Trajectory tree example.

ReMax return. Given a trajectory tree  $\mathcal{T}$ , we define our ReMax return  $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{ReMax}}(\mathcal{T})$ . Here, we assume that the trajectory tree  $\mathcal{T}$  has  $K$  leaf nodes. For  $k \in \{1, \dots, K\}$ , we define the trajectory path  $\tau^{(k)}$  as the subsequence of  $\mathcal{T}$  consisting of the states and actions in the path from the root node to the  $k$ -th leaf. For example, the trajectory tree in Fig. 2 has two trajectory paths  $\tau^{(1)} = (s_0, u_0, \dots, s_4)$  and  $\tau^{(2)} = (s_0, u_0, \dots, s_2 = s_5, u_5, \dots, s_7)$ . We define the ReMax return on the trajectory tree by

$$
\mathcal {R} _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} (\mathcal {T}) := \max  _ {k \in \{1, \dots , K \}} \mathcal {R} \left(\tau^ {(k)}\right), \tag {2}
$$

where,  $\mathcal{R}(\tau^{(k)})$  is the return along the path  $\tau^{(k)}$  defined as in conventional RL.

ReMax objective. Our proposed objective is to maximize the expected ReMax return:

$$
J _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} (\pi) := \mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {T}} \left[ \mathcal {R} _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} (\mathcal {T}) \right]. \tag {3}
$$

Note that if no resetting occurs,  $J_{\mathrm{ReMax}}$  reduces to  $J_{\mathrm{RL}}$ . It is worth mentioning that if the MDP is deterministic, there exists a deterministic policy  $\pi^{*}: S \to \mathcal{A}$  that maximizes both  $J_{\mathrm{RL}}$  and  $J_{\mathrm{ReMax}}$ . This is obvious as an optimal policy for  $J_{\mathrm{RL}}$  also maximizes  $J_{\mathrm{ReMax}}$  because resetting cannot increase the ReMax return if all of the chosen actions were optimal. Interestingly, while there exists a common deterministic optimal policy, optimizing the ReMax objective enhances exploration during training in a deterministic environment. We describe this phenomenon in Sec. 5.

# 4.2 REMAX POLICY GRADIENT METHOD

We propose to optimize the ReMax objective using policy gradients. As the simplest realization of the ReMax PG method, we consider REINFORCE. Given a trajectory tree  $\mathcal{T}$ , our gradient estimator is

$$
\hat {g} _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} := \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {T - 1} \nabla_ {\phi} \log \pi_ {\phi} \left(u _ {t} \mid s _ {t}\right) \left(\mathcal {R} _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} (\mathcal {T}) - b _ {t}\right), \tag {4}
$$

where  $\pi_{\phi}:S\times \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Re}}\to [0,1]$  is the parameterized policy to optimize, and  $b_{t}$  is a baseline for variance reduction (Sec. 2). This estimator is unbiased:  $\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{T}}[\hat{g}_{\mathrm{ReMax}}] = \nabla_{\phi}J_{\mathrm{ReMax}}(\pi_{\phi})$

Policies in this study. In ReMDPs, agents must select actions from the extended action space  $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Re}} = \mathcal{A} \bigcup \mathcal{X}$ . In this study, we decompose the policy  $\pi_{\mathrm{Re}}: S \times \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Re}} \to [0,1]$  into three independent components: the policy of the original MDP  $\pi_{\mathcal{A}}: S \times \mathcal{A} \to [0,1]$ , the policy of where to reset to  $\pi_{\mathcal{X}}(u|s): S \times \mathcal{X} \to [0,1]$ , and the policy of whether to reset  $y \sim \eta(y|s)$ , where  $y \in \{0,1\}$  is a binary variable: 1 means to reset, and 0 means to act in the MDP. Using these components, we have

$$
\pi_ {\mathrm {R e}} (u | s, y) = (1 - y) \pi_ {\mathcal {A}} (a | s) + y \pi_ {\mathcal {X}} (x | s). \tag {5}
$$

As our main focus in this study is the emergence of exploration from our ReMax objective, we only employ simple deterministic rule-based policies for  $\pi_{\mathcal{X}}$  and  $\eta$ . We show that, even with such deterministic reset policies, the policy for the original MDP  $\pi_{\mathcal{A}}$  becomes stochastic. Each realization

of  $\pi_{\mathcal{X}}$  and  $\eta$  is described in the corresponding experimental setup section. We parameterize  $\pi_{\mathcal{A}}$  as  $\pi_{\theta}$ . As the reset policy  $\pi_{\mathcal{X}}$  is non-parameterized, we can rewrite Eq. 4 as

$$
\hat {g} _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} = \sum_ {t \mid u _ {t} = a _ {t} \in \mathcal {A}} \nabla_ {\theta} \log \pi_ {\theta} \left(a _ {t} \mid s _ {t}\right) \left(\mathcal {R} _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} (\mathcal {T}) - b _ {t}\right), \tag {6}
$$

where  $t|u_{t} = a_{t}\in \mathcal{A}$  is an abbreviation of  $t\in \{t|u_t = a_t\in \mathcal{A}\}$  and  $\pi_{\theta}$  is the parameterized policy for the original MDP. One may use more sophisticated reset policies with search algorithms or trainable models for better performance. We leave such improved reset policies for future work.

Reset Policy Gradient Theorem. Finally, recall that in standard PG methods, one only needs to consider the rewards following an action in the PG, while ignoring the rewards obtained before the current time-step, as the action has no effect on what happened in the past. This is not the case in the reset PG method—the state may be reset to the past, cancelling out previously received rewards. Thus, we may have to consider the full return over the trajectory tree at each time-step. One wonders whether a similar PG theorem could be derived for the case with resets; whether some of the rewards in the return could be deleted while still guaranteeing unbiasedness. A sufficient condition for unbiasedness is formalized in the theorem below. Note that we provide this theorem for completeness and for a few justifications, but do not incorporate it in our algorithms.

Theorem 1 (Reset Policy Gradient Theorem). Denote  $\tau^{*}$  is the optimal trajectory in the tree,  $\mathcal{T}$ , so that  $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{ReMax}}(\mathcal{T}) = \mathcal{R}(\tau^{*}) = \sum_{(s,a)\in \tau^{*}}r(s,a)$ . Moreover, denote  $\tau_{\mathrm{fixed}}(s_t)$  is a subsequence  $\tau_{\mathrm{fixed}}(s_t)\in \tau^*$ , starting at  $s_0$  and ending at  $s_h$ ,  $h < t$ , s.t. for all possible trajectories with  $k\geq t$ , and all  $s\in \tau_{\mathrm{fixed}}(s_t)$  we have  $s\notin \mathcal{X}(s_k)$ , where  $\mathcal{X}(s_k)$  is the set of admissible states to reset to in state  $s_k$ . In other words,  $\tau_{\mathrm{fixed}}(s_t)$  is the set of states in the optimal trajectory to which it is impossible to reset to when starting at state  $s_t$ , at any point following time-step,  $t$ . Then we have

$$
\nabla_ {\theta} \mathbb {E} \left[ \mathcal {R} _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} (\mathcal {T}) \right] = \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t | u _ {t} = a _ {t} \in \mathcal {A}} \nabla_ {\theta} \log \pi_ {\theta} \left(a _ {t} \mid s _ {t}\right) \left(\mathcal {R} _ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} (\mathcal {T}) - \mathcal {R} \left(\tau_ {\text {f i x e d}} (s _ {t})\right) - b _ {t}\right) \right] \tag {7}
$$

# 5 STEP 2: REMAX ON A DETERMINISTIC TABULAR MDP

In the bandit task (Sec. 3), the emergence of exploration relied on the uncertainty of the environment. To resolve this limitation, in step two of our experiments, we show that exploration also emerges in a deterministic MDP. We consider a tabular maze environment that we call the biased maze (Fig. 3). Though this maze has no explicit uncertainty or hidden state like the bandit task, we argue that function approximation and generalization leads to an implicit uncertainty, and we show that optimizing the ReMax objective promotes a stochastic exploratory policy even in deterministic MDPs.

Problem. The maze is a deterministic MDP with admissible actions 0 or 1 in each state. The agent receives a reward of 1 for each step forward. There is only one correct path in the maze (the red line in Fig. 3), and as long as the agent chooses the correct action, it can continue to move forward up to a maximum sufficient fixed length.

![](images/1f982405fe6a6d505b96f72455a25939d96dcd700ef7d9132408b86706dbfe87.jpg)  
Figure 3: Biased maze example.

Once the agent chooses the wrong action, the maze will terminate after one or two steps, depending on whether the following action is also wrong (or not). We designed the maze such that the correct action is 1 in  $75\%$  of the states. In this sense, the maze is biased as action 1 tends to lead a higher return.

Setup. We train a policy  $\pi (a = 1|s_i) = \sigma (w_i + c)$ , where  $i$  indicates the state index, each state  $i$  has a corresponding local parameter  $w_{i}$ , and  $c$  is a global scalar bias term shared by all states. We expect  $w_{i}$  to extract the local information at the  $i$ -th state and  $c$  to learn the global information over the states. We compared training the policy with the standard REINFORCE and with the ReMax version. In this experiment, the resets happen when the agent reaches a terminal state ( $\eta (y = 1|s) = 1$  if  $s$  is terminal and 0 otherwise), and the agent always resets back by  $m = 2$  steps. We used the SGD optimizer. We estimate the gradient from a batch of 16 trajectory tree samples, and the baseline  $b_{t}$  is calculated from the batch mean. For a fair comparison of the two algorithms, separate from the training episodes, we include evaluation episodes that are not used for training the policy. In the

Figure 4: Biased maze results. (A) Evaluation return and average probability of selecting action 1 at a new (unseen) state with different  $K$ . The evaluation return is computed without resetting, even if  $K > 1$ . The shaded area indicates the standard error. (B) Evaluation return for different learning rates at 10M steps. The bar indicates the standard error.

evaluation episodes, we use greedy action selection, as commonly done in previous work (Haarnoja et al., 2018; Hafner et al., 2021). We emphasize that no resetting is used in the evaluation episodes.

Hypothesis. Biased maze is a fully observable deterministic MDP. However, we claim that, during training, there exists uncertainty when the agent reaches a previously unseen new state. At each new state, the agent does not know whether action 1 or 0 is correct. Moreover, based on the structure of the maze, action 1 is preferable as it has a higher probability of being correct. As our agent can control the "prior" policy at unseen states using the bias parameter  $c$ , we hypothesize that ReMax should promote exploration even in such a deterministic MDP. We note that such "implicit" uncertainty in fully observable MDPs has been previously studied in relation to generalization (Ghosh et al., 2021).

Results. Fig. 4 (A) shows the results with the learning rate 0.003. The standard REINFORCE algorithm  $(K = 1)$ , quickly converged to a suboptimal policy that deterministically chooses action 1 at an unseen state, and the evaluation return stopped increasing. On the other hand, ReMax  $(K > 1)$  promoted more exploratory policies. We also see that larger  $K$  lead to more exploration and higher evaluation returns. These trends were consistent with other reasonable learning rates. Moreover, the regular REINFORCE cannot be greatly improved even when tuning the learning rate (Fig. 4 B).

Discussion. Here, we showed that ReMax promotes exploration even in a deterministic MDP; however, this phenomenon relied on a shared parameter  $c$ . One may wonder whether this setup is realistic. In step three of our experiments (Sec. 6), we show that  $c$  can be replaced with typical parameterized function approximator policies in RL, and demonstrate the consistency of the phenomenon.

# 6 STEP 3: REMAX ON A DETERMINISTIC MDP WITH VISUAL INPUTS

In the previous biased maze experiment, the model was too simple and it remained unclear whether exploration would emerge in a more practical scenario. In the third step of our experiments, we demonstrate that optimizing the ReMax objective promotes exploration even in a practical scenario with neural network function approximators, which have been proven successful in visual input environments (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2016). For this purpose, we introduce the MNIST maze environment.

Figure 5: MNIST maze example.

Problem. Inspired by Elfwing et al. (2016) we consider an MNIST maze, a modified version of the biased maze (Fig. 5). This maze is also a deterministic MDP but has visual inputs. In the maze, the agent can observe an MNIST image (LeCun et al., 1998) as a hint in addition to the state index. Each MNIST image is zero or one, indicating the correct action at the state. Unlike the biased maze there are an equal number of ones and zeros; however, the MNIST image hints are wrong with probability 0.25. Note that this flip does not change between the different episodes. The agent may solve the maze efficiently by generalizing the information in the images. However, if the agent blindly trusts the hints, it will fall into a suboptimal policy that deterministically follows the hints.

Setup. We use the same setup as the biased maze experiment unless stated otherwise. Our neural network is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer with 128 units, followed by a

sigmoid activation function. We denote this MLP as  $f_{\phi}$ , where  $\phi$  are the parameters of the MLP. The MLP takes the image,  $\mathrm{img}_i$ , at state  $i$  as an input and produces the output  $y_i = f_{\phi}(\mathrm{img}_i) \in \mathbb{R}$ . The policy is  $\pi(a = 1|s_i) = \sigma(w_i + dy_i)$ , where the  $d$  hyperparameter controls the contribution from the MLP. We trained both the state-wise parameter  $w$  and MLP parameters  $\phi$  simultaneously. We tuned the learning rate and  $d$  hyperparameters in a different environment setting, where the hint flip probability was zero. The chosen learning rate and  $d$  are 0.003 and 0.01, respectively. See App. E for the validation experiments regarding the hyperparameters.

Results and discussion. Fig. 6 shows the results. Like in the biased maze results, when  $K = 1$ , the policy quickly became deterministic, trusting the MNIST image hints too much in new states, and the learning stopped. On the other hand, ReMax ( $K > 1$ ) promoted exploration and showed better performance. Thus, we have demonstrated that exploration emerges even in practical scenarios that utilize neural network function approximators. Finally, we will add implementation tricks, and demonstrate the feasibility of using ReMax to promote exploration in modern PG algorithms (Sec. 8).

# 7 SUMMARY OF THE 3-PHASED EXPERIMENTS AND FURTHER ANALYSIS

In the three phases of our experiments, we examined our hypothesis step by step: First, we verified that, by optimizing the ReMax objective, a stochastic policy emerges as the optimal policy in a simple bandit problem (Sec. 3). Secondly, we confirmed that stochastic exploration emerges even in a deterministic MDP (Sec. 5). Finally, we demonstrated that this result is consistent in realistic scenarios with neural network function approximation (Sec. 6). In this section, we complement our experiments by showing ablation studies on two components of ReMax: maximization and resetting. Also, we address the overestimation problem in stochastic environments and propose a method to relieve it.

ReMax objective ablation study. To demonstrate that not only the resetting but also the maximization in the ReMax return is important for the emergence of a stochastic policy, we change the maximum operator in the objective to the average operator and compare the performance in the biased maze problem (Fig. 7 A). We see that when we use the average, the policy becomes deterministic faster and results in poor performance. See App. C.2 for ablation studies with other return definitions.

Reset policy ablation study. We also examined the effect of the reset policy on the performance in the biased maze task. As the reset policy used in the previous experiments is well-tuned using the information of the maze structure, we prepared two other reset policies that utilize no environment information: random reset and heuristic reset. The random reset simply chooses where to reset randomly from the preceding states in the trajectory. The heuristic reset returns to the state  $s$  where  $\pi_{\theta}(a|s)$  is the smallest among the previously visited states in the preceding trajectory when the agent reaches the terminal state. Note that these two reset policies have only one hyperparameter  $K$  and are not tuned using the information of the maze environment. Fig. 7 (B) shows the performance of ReMax REINFORCE with these reset policies. Also, the results of REINFORCE using an entropy bonus are shown for comparison. The tuned reset is the same reset policy as in the previous experiments ( $m$ -step reset with  $m = 2$ ). We found that the choice of reset policy is critical: tuned reset performed the best and heuristic reset achieved significantly better performance than random reset. However,

we also found that even with a poor reset policy like the random reset, it achieves a comparable performance to that of the entropy bonus. The performance gap between the heuristic reset and the tuned reset may be filled by a sophisticated reset policy, which we leave for future work.

Overestimation in a stochastic environment. The maze environments we studied are deterministic. Here we discuss a problem that may arise when optimizing the ReMax objective in stochastic environments. We consider another two-armed bandit problem: Taking  $a = 0$  gives a reward  $r_0 = 1$  deterministically, and  $a = 1$  gives a random reward  $r_1$ , which follows the uniform distribution on  $[-10, 10]$ . In this bandit problem, the optimal policy in the RL objective is deterministically choosing  $a = 0$  as  $r_0 = 1 > 0 = \mathbb{E}_{r_1}[r_1]$ . However, the optimal policy in ReMax

![](images/7d4730fabafc3cd1a0aaa56f118bffa2940e19d8d359edc0700a879b50119604.jpg)  
Figure 8: Overestimation example.

is  $a = 1$ . The blue line in Fig. 8 shows  $J_{\mathrm{ReMax}}$  with  $K = 2$ . In this example, the ReMax objective overestimates the action with a high-variance reward because it may randomly achieve a higher reward when playing an arm a second time. To relieve this problem, we propose a simple seed-fixing trick: inside an episode, the random seed is frozen. Thus, taking the same actions in the same state would always result in the same state transition. This simple trick can prevent the agent from repeating the action with a high-variance reward as it always gives the same result inside each episode. The orange line in Fig. 8 shows  $J_{\mathrm{ReMax}}$  with this trick. Now the greedy action with the optimal policy in ReMax is  $a = 0$ . Note that the bandit example described in Sec. 3 can be regarded as a problem to which this trick is applied.

# 8 PRACTICAL ALGORITHM: REMAX A2C

We saw that ReMax promotes exploration in the classical REINFORCE algorithm. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying ReMax to promote exploration in modern PG methods. Especially, we apply ReMax to A2C, a synchronous version of the A3C algorithm (Mnih et al., 2016).

Truncated rollouts with resetting. Instead of performing actions for a full episode of  $T$  time-steps, then updating the policy, A2C updates the policy many times during an episode, using truncated rollouts of length  $H < T$ . A2C estimates the PG on a batch of such fixed-length truncated trajectories. Using truncated rollouts improves the speed of learning by increasing the frequency of updates, and by reducing the PG variance. ReMax A2C analogously uses a batch of truncated trajectory trees with fixed tree sizes. We describe the detailed rollout procedure in App. F.

Advantage estimation. Given a truncated rollout trajectory  $\tau$ , A2C uses an advantage estimator  $\hat{A}_t(\tau) \coloneqq \sum_{h=t}^{H-1} \gamma^{h-t} r_h + V_\theta(s_H) - V_\theta(s_t)$  composed of the  $n$ -step future return and a value function baseline, where  $\gamma$  is a discount factor,  $H$  is the truncated last time-step in  $\tau$ , and  $V_\theta$  is a parameterized value function. Note that if  $s_H$  happens to be a terminal state,  $V_\theta(s_H)$  is set to zero. As an analogy of  $\hat{A}_t$ , given a truncated trajectory tree  $\mathcal{T}$  by Algorithm 1, we define  $\hat{A}_t^{\mathrm{ReMax}}$  using the best  $n$ -step future return and a value function baseline:

$$
\hat {A} _ {t} ^ {\operatorname {R e M a x}} (\mathcal {T}) := \max  _ {k \in \{k \mid s _ {t} \in \tau^ {(k)} \}} \left\{\sum_ {i = i _ {k, t}} ^ {I _ {k} - 1} \gamma^ {i - i _ {k, t}} r _ {i} ^ {(k)} + V _ {\theta} \left(s _ {I _ {k}} ^ {(k)}\right) \right\} - V _ {\theta} (s _ {t}), \tag {8}
$$

where  $s_i^{(k)}$  indicates the  $i$ -th node on the  $k$ -th trajectory path (from the root node to the leaf node),  $I_k$  is the time-step index of the leaf node, and  $i_{k,t}$  is the time-step index of state  $s_t$  on the  $k$ -th path satisfying  $s_{i_{k,t}}^{(k)} = s_t$  for  $k \in \{k|s_t \in \tau^{(k)}\}$ . Note that this estimator ignores the rewards before the state  $s_t$ , while they should be included if we wish to guarantee unbiasedness. However, based on Thm. 1 we can ignore all rewards received before the truncated rollout, and empirically we found that ignoring the rewards from the start of the truncated rollout performed well. In the next section, we empirically verify that ReMax A2C, a PG method with this estimator, also promotes exploration.

# 8.1 EVALUATION ON MINATAR ENVIRONMENTS

Finally, we evaluate our ReMax A2C in the MinAtar environments (Young & Tian, 2019), which include five simplified versions of ALE games with image observations (Bellemare et al., 2013):

![](images/9f1e75a8827c615c8d5db42d90354d9b63812364d326290e7cdc0a642029b5b4.jpg)  
Figure 9: MinAtar results. (A) Average evaluation return for 10 runs. (B) Average probability of the selected action during the evaluation. The shaded area indicates the standard error.

Asterix, Breakout, Freeway, Seaquest, and SpaceInvaders. Ceron & Castro (2021) reported that algorithmic improvements on MinAtar transferred to the full Atari, thus allowing for more inclusive RL research as it becomes possible to test new methods using fewer computational resources. We compared the performance of our ReMax A2C and the standard A2C (without entropy bonus). We also report the performance of standard A2C (with entropy bonus) for comparison.

Setup. We employed the same convolutional neural network architecture as Young & Tian (2019). There are 64 parallel rollout workers, and the rollout length is limited to 32 for all algorithms. We used the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015). The reset policy  $\pi_{\mathcal{X}}$  was the heuristic reset described in Sec. 7. Hyperparameters were grid-searched using five validation runs, which use different random seeds from test runs. See App. G for the details of network architecture and hyperparameter selection.

Results and discussion. The experiments confirm that ReMax promoted more exploratory policies than A2C (w/o entropy bonus) and lead to better performance in all games (Fig. 9), despite not including any explicit exploration bonus. We note that in the Freeway environment, the episodes always continue for 2500 steps without any early termination by reaching a terminal state, yet our proposal of randomly resetting in non-terminal states with a small probability was sufficient to promote exploration. These results confirm that it is not intractable to construct reset policies that allow taking advantage of ReMax to promote exploration in modern PG algorithms, and even simple heuristics may be sufficient. Comparing A2C (w/ entropy bonus) to ReMax A2C, there was no clear winner. Our main objective in this work is to propose ReMax as a competing or complimentary approach to promote stochastic exploration. As entropy bonuses have been researched for a long time, we believe it is promising that our new method, ReMax, shows competitive performance.

# 9 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK

We studied our hypothesis that optimizing the ReMax objective may result in an exploratory policy without an explicit exploration bonus. We empirically verified our hypothesis with the 3-phased experiments: randomized bandit (Sec. 3), the deterministic biased maze (Sec. 5), and the maze with visual inputs (Sec.6): Even in a fully observable deterministic environment, a stochastic policy emerged as a result of optimizing the ReMax objective, without any explicit exploration bonus. We also extended our ReMax PG to ReMax A2C, an analogy of the popular A2C algorithm, and showed that ReMax A2C could promote exploration and result in better performance in MinAtar.

The type of promoted exploration is stochastic similar to exploration from an entropy bonus. Thus, it has the same limitations as the competing stochastic exploration methods: For example, dense reward signals may be required. Also, as we focused on testing our hypothesis, we only considered simple rule-based resetting at the terminal states. However, we emphasize that our focus in this study is not on proposing a new powerful exploration method but on testing our hypothesis. The application to hard exploration problems (e.g., large action spaces or sparse rewards) is future work.

One promising future work direction is to build more practical reset policies: When combined with powerful search algorithms such as MCTS, it may be possible to enhance the efficient exploration further. In addition, we may also train the reset policy by optimizing the RL (or probably the ReMax) objective to discover more efficient search methods depending on the task. We believe that new directions of exploration study in RL could also emerge from the ReMax objective.
