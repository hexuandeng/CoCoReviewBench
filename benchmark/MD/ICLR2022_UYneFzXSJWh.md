# ABSTRACT

When transferring a pretrained model to a downstream task, two popular methods are fine-tuning (updating all the model parameters) and linear probing (updating only the last linear layer). It is well known that fine-tuning leads to better accuracy in-distribution (ID). However, in this paper, we show that fine-tuning can achieve worse accuracy than linear probing out-of-distribution (OOD), especially when the pretrained features are good and distribution shift is large. On six distribution shift datasets (Breedsliving17, Breeds-Entity30, DomainNet, CIFAR  $\rightarrow$  STL, CIFAR10.1, FMoW), fine-tuning obtains an average  $2\%$  higher accuracy ID but  $6\%$  lower accuracy OOD than linear probing. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs arising in fine-tuning overparameterized two-layer linear networks, characterizing how fine-tuning can distort high-quality pretrained features which leads to low OOD accuracy. Our analysis suggests the simple two-step strategy of linear probing then full fine-tuning, which combines the benefits of both fine-tuning and linear probing to achieve better ID and OOD accuracy than fine-tuning, both theoretically and on the above datasets ( $1\%$  better ID,  $8\%$  better OOD).

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Pretraining a model on a large dataset before transferring to a downstream task's training data substantially improves accuracy over training from scratch—for example, pretraining a ResNet-50 on unlabeled ImageNet boosts accuracy on CIFAR-10 from  $94\%$  to  $98\%$  (Chen et al., 2020a;b). High-stakes applications such as poverty mapping in under-resourced countries (Jean et al., 2016), self-driving cars (Yu et al., 2020), and medical diagnosis (AlBadawy et al., 2018), require models that also generalize to circumstances not seen in the training distribution. In addition to testing on data drawn from the downstream task's training distribution (in-distribution; ID) it is increasingly important to test on data distributions unseen during training (out-of-distribution; OOD).

After initializing with a pretrained model, two popular transfer methods are fine-tuning (running gradient descent on all the model parameters), and linear probing (tuning the head but freezing lower layers). In the ID setting it is well known that fine-tuning leads to better accuracy than linear probing (Kornblith et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2020; He et al., 2020), and even when testing OOD prior work usually fine-tunes all parameters of their model (Hendrycks et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2021; Andreassen et al., 2021). Intuitively, fine-tuning all layers of a network can improve pretrained features by tailoring them to the specific task, while linear probing freezes these features.

In this work, we investigate the OOD performance of fine-tuning and linear probing and find that surprisingly, fine-tuning often does worse than linear probing in the presence of large distribution shift. We experiment on six distribution shift benchmarks (Breeds Living17, Breeds Entity30, DomainNet, CIFAR  $\rightarrow$  STL, CIFAR10.1, FMoW geo-shift), initializing with good pretrained features from MoCo-v2 (Chen et al., 2020b) and CLIP (Radford et al., 2021). While both methods offer gains over training from scratch, fine-tuning improves the average ID accuracy from  $84\%$  to  $86\%$  but brings down the OOD accuracy from  $72\%$  to  $67\%$  (Figure 1).

When and why does fine-tuning underperform linear probing? We theoretically consider fine-tuning a two-layer linear network in an overparameterized regression setting where the feature extractor layer has been pretrained to map high-dimensional inputs to useful, lower-dimensional, features. We prove that fine-tuning is worse than linear probing on worst-case OOD inputs when using high quality pretrained features. Even with an infinitesimally small learning rate, fine-tuning distorts pretrained features—the features of ID data are updated while those of OOD data remain unchanged.

Figure 1: Given a good feature extractor (top-left), a randomly initialized head is added to map features to outputs and we can (a) fine-tune all the model parameters or (b) linear-probe, which freezes the feature extractor and trains only the head. We run experiments on six distribution shift datasets. Fine-tuning does well when the test example is sampled from the fine-tuning distribution (ID), but underperforms on test examples sampled from OOD distributions. (c) Our theory says that fine-tuning distorts the pretrained feature extractor leading to poor OOD accuracy, but initializing with a linear probed head fixes this—empirically LP-FT gets better accuracies both ID and OOD.

Since the head and feature extractor are simultaneously optimized during fine-tuning to a configuration that works well on ID training data, the head only accommodates the distorted features of ID points and performs poorly on the unchanged features of OOD points. Interestingly, we show that this feature distortion issue cannot be simply fixed by early stopping—throughout the process of fine-tuning, we never pass through parameters that do well OOD. On the other hand, we show that linear-probing extrapolates better OOD because it preserves pretrained features, but does not do as well as fine-tuning ID because linear probing cannot adapt the features to the downstream task.

Technical challenges. Existing theoretical work on transfer learning focuses on linear probing (Wu et al., 2020; Tripuraneni et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020). In contrast, the analysis of fine-tuning is scarce and challenging because it requires understanding the training dynamics, instead of only the loss function and its global minimizers. In fact, fine-tuning and training from scratch optimize the same training loss and only differ in their initializations (pretrained vs random). A mathematical analysis that distinguishes them needs to capture properties of the different global minima that these algorithms converge to, a phenomenon that is sometimes theoretically referred to as the implicit regularization effect of initialization (Neyshabur et al., 2014). Accordingly, our analysis reasons about the parameters that gradient methods pass through starting from the pretrained initialization, which is challenging because there is no known closed form for this trajectory. Two-layer linear networks are widely studied in the implicit regularization community (Saxe et al., 2014; Arora et al., 2018), however they analyze random and often small initializations which don't capture pretraining.

Algorithmic implications. Our theory says that fine-tuning fails because when trying to fit ID training data with a randomly initialized head, the feature extractor changes significantly for ID examples, making features for ID and OOD examples largely inconsistent. This can be fixed by initializing with a good head that does not need to be updated much during fine-tuning, reducing how much the feature extractor changes. This suggests the simple two-step strategy of first linear-probing to find a good head and then full fine-tuning (LP-FT). Empirically, LP-FT outperforms fine-tuning and linear-probing, both ID and OOD. Even on CIFAR-10.1 (small distribution shift), where fine-tuning is better for both ID and OOD, we find LP-FT outperforms fine-tuning on both metrics. We note that LP-FT and vanilla fine-tuning use similar amounts of compute because the first step of linear probing is relatively very cheap.

Practical insights. Finally, we check whether fine-tuning fails and LP-FT works, for the reasons predicted by our feature distortion theory. As predicted by the theory, we find that: (1) fine-tuning indeed never matches the OOD accuracy of linear probing throughout the course of training, (2) fine-tuning changes the features for ID examples more than for OOD examples leading to distortions (3) fine-tuning can do better than linear probing OOD if the pretrained features are not very high quality (MoCo-v1 instead of MoCo-v2) or the ID and OOD datasets are very close (e.g., CIFAR-10 and

CIFAR-10.1) and (4) LP-FT indeed changes both ID and OOD features orders of magnitude less than fine-tuning does.

# 2 SETUP

Task and evaluation. Given training samples  $\{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$  sampled from some distribution  $P_{\mathrm{id}}$ , our goal is to learn a predictor  $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathcal{V}$  to map inputs  $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$  to outputs  $y \in \mathcal{V}$ . We evaluate predictors on their standard "in-distribution" (ID) performance  $L_{\mathrm{id}}$  on new test samples drawn from  $P_{\mathrm{id}}$  that the training data is also sampled from. We also evaluate classifiers on their "out-of-distribution" (OOD) performance  $L_{\mathrm{ood}}$  on test samples drawn from a new distribution  $P_{\mathrm{ood}}$  that is different from  $P_{\mathrm{id}}$ . Formally, for some loss function  $\ell$ , we evaluate classifiers on:

$$
L _ {\mathrm {i d}} (f) = \underset {(x, y) \sim P _ {\mathrm {i d}}} {\mathbb {E}} [ \ell (f (x), y) ] \text {a n d} L _ {\mathrm {o o d}} (f) = \underset {(x, y) \sim P _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} {\mathbb {E}} [ \ell (f (x), y) ]. \tag {2.1}
$$

Models. In this work, we focus on predictors that leverage pretrained feature extractors. For convenience of such analyses, we parameterize the final predictor in terms of a linear "head"  $v \in \mathcal{V}$  on top of some features  $g_{B}(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$  for some "base" parameters  $B \in \mathcal{B}$ . Formally,  $f$  is parameterized by base parameter  $B$  and head parameters  $v$  such that  $f_{v,B}(x) = v^{\top}g_{B}(x)$ . In our experiments (Section 4),  $g_{B}$  is a deep network and in our theory (Section 3),  $g_{B}$  is a linear projection.

We assume access to some initial pretrained feature extractor  $B_{0}$  that is obtained by training on potentially large amounts of data from a distribution that could be different from  $P_{\mathrm{id}}$  and  $P_{\mathrm{ood}}$ . We focus on two popular methods to learn a predictor  $f_{v,B}$  given training data from  $P_{\mathrm{id}}$ : (i) linear probing where  $B = B_{0}$  and the linear head is obtained by minimizing some loss (e.g., logistic loss for classification, squared loss for regression) on the training data, and (ii) fine-tuning where both  $v$  and  $B$  are updated by performing gradient descent on some loss on the training data with  $B$  initialized at  $B_{0}$ .

# 3 THEORY: FINE-TUNING DISTORTS PRETRAINED FEATURES

We theoretically study the performance of different training methods that use a good pretrained feature extractor. In a linear setting, we characterize when and why fine-tuning, in which all model parameters are updated, can increase OOD loss due to feature distortion. We define the problem setting in Section 3.1, and present the main result and proof sketch in Section 3.2.

Our analysis handles two key challenges which distinguish it from prior work on transfer learning in linear models (Wu et al., 2020; Tripuraneni et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2021). Prior work focuses on linear probing, while we study fine-tuning where the resulting optimization problem is non-convex and we need to analyze the effect of initialization from a particular pretrained parameter setting. We also study overparameterized models where the number of training examples is less than the input dimension, reflecting the practical setting where neural networks achieve zero training loss. Here, training loss alone does not determine test performance—this fact makes the setting very relevant because both training from scratch and fine-tuning have same training loss but very different test performance, but also makes the analysis challenging.

# 3.1 LINEAR OVERPARAMIZED SETTING

Models. Recall from Section 2 that we parameterize predictors in terms of base and head parameters. In this section, we study models where the feature extractor is linear, i.e.  $f_{v,B}(x) = v^{\top}Bx$  where  $B\in \mathcal{B} = \mathbb{R}^{k\times d}$ , and  $v\in \mathcal{V} = \mathbb{R}^k$ .

For simplicity, we assume the models are well-specified i.e.  $y = v_{\star}^{\top}B_{\star}x$  where  $v_{\star}\in \mathbb{R}^{k}$  and  $B_{\star}\in \mathbb{R}^{k\times d}$ . Note that  $B_{\star}$  and  $v_{\star}$  are only unique up to rotations, i.e., for any rotation matrix  $U$ ,  $(Uv_{\star})^{T}(UB_{\star})x = v_{\star}^{T}B_{\star}x$ .

Suppose we have a pretrained feature extractor  $B_0$  close to  $B_{\star}$ , so  $\min_U \| B_0 - UB_{\star} \|_2 \leq \epsilon$  over rotation matrices  $U \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$  — this follows from prior work in pretraining (Tripuraneni et al., 2020). As in prior work suppose  $B_{\star}, B_0$  have been orthogonalized to have orthonormal rows.

Data distribution and evaluation. For our analysis, we focus on regression, where  $\mathcal{V} = \mathbb{R}$  and  $\ell$  is the squared loss. Let  $X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ ,  $X\neq 0$  be a matrix encoding  $n$  training points from  $P_{\mathrm{id}}$  where each of the  $n$  rows is a training input. Let  $Y\in \mathbb{R}^n$  be the corresponding outputs. We consider an overparameterized setting where  $1\le k < n < d$  and  $k < d - n$ . Intuitively, the input dimension  $d$  is high (e.g., 10K), feature dimension  $k$  is lower (e.g., 100) and  $n$  is in the middle (e.g., 5K).

In this work, we are primarily interested in the out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Since the OOD data can be arbitrary we follow prior work (Rosenfeld et al., 2021; Kamath et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021b) and consider the worst case loss over distributions (equivalently, individual points) of bounded norm:

$$
L _ {\mathbf {o o d}} (v, B) = \max  _ {\| x \| _ {2} \leq 1} \left(v _ {\star} ^ {\top} B _ {\star} x - v ^ {\top} B x\right) ^ {2} = \| B _ {\star} ^ {\top} v _ {\star} - B ^ {\top} v \| _ {2} ^ {2} \tag {3.1}
$$

Training methods. Given training data and a pretrained base parameter  $B_{0}$ , we study the two popular methods of linear probing (LP) and fine-tuning (FT) to learn the final predictor (See Section 2). Both methods involve optimizing the training loss via gradient descent (or variants). In order to effectively analyze these gradient based algorithms, we study vanishing step sizes leading to gradient flows. Gradient flows can be thought of as a continuous time analog of gradient based methods and have been extensively studied in recent years as a way to understand gradient based methods (Gunasekar et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018). Formally, for training loss  $\widehat{L}(v,B) = \|XB^{\top}v - Y\|_2^2$ , the gradient flow differential equations for LP and FT are as follows.

$$
\partial_ {t} v _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t) = - \nabla_ {v} \widehat {L} \left(v _ {\mathrm {l p}} (t), B _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t)\right), \partial_ {t} B _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t) = - \nabla_ {B} \widehat {L} \left(v _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t), B _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t)\right) \tag {3.2}
$$

$$
\partial_ {t} v _ {\mathrm {l p}} (t) = - \nabla_ {v} \widehat {L} \left(v _ {\mathrm {l p}} (t), B _ {0}\right), \partial_ {t} B _ {\mathrm {l p}} (t) = 0, \tag {3.3}
$$

initialized with  $B_{\mathrm{ft}}(0) = B_{\mathrm{lp}}(0) = B_0$  and  $v_{\mathrm{ft}}(0) = v_{\mathrm{lp}}(0) = v_0$ . In practice, the head parameter  $v_0$  is initialized randomly—our results hold for any standard random initialization Glorot & Bengio (2010), for example  $v_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$  for any  $\sigma^2$ . Recall that the initial value of the base parameter  $B_0$  is assumed to be available and obtained via pretraining.

The final LP and FT solutions are the limit points of the corresponding gradient flows:

$$
v _ {\mathrm {f t}} ^ {\infty} = \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} v _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t) \text {a n d} B _ {\mathrm {f t}} ^ {\infty} = \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} B _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t) \tag {3.4}
$$

$$
v _ {\mathfrak {l p}} ^ {\infty} = \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} v _ {\mathfrak {l p}} (t) \text {a n d} B _ {\mathfrak {l p}} ^ {\infty} = \lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} B _ {\mathfrak {l p}} (t) = B _ {0} \tag {3.5}
$$

# 3.2 FINE-TUNING DISTORTS PRETRAINED FEATURES

The more common method of using a pretrained feature extractor is fine-tuning (FT) which typically improves ID performance relative to linear probing (LP). In this section, we show theoretically that FT distorts features leading to poor OOD performance. We first present the key intuitions demonstrating potential issues of FT and then present our formal theorem lower bounding the OOD error of FT.

# 3.2.1 KEY INTUITIONS

There are two main pieces that we use to characterize when and why FT has higher OOD error.

1. Features get distorted because representations change only in the ID subspace (i.e., subspace along the training data) and are unchanged in the orthogonal subspace. Taking the derivative of the training loss  $\widehat{L}(v, B) = \|XB^\top v - Y\|_2^2$  with respect to the base feature parameter  $B$ , we get:

$$
\nabla_ {B} \widehat {L} (v, B) = 2 v (Y - X B v) ^ {\top} X \tag {3.6}
$$

By definition, if  $u$  is a direction orthogonal to the training subspace,  $\nabla_B \widehat{L}(v, B)u = 0$ , that is the gradient updates to  $B$  do not modify  $Bu$  for  $u \in S^\perp$ . However, the gradient is non-zero for directions  $u$  in the ID subspace and the corresponding features  $Bu$  change across the FT process. This leads to feature distortion where the features in some subspaces are updated but not others, leading to inconsistencies relative to the pretrained initialization. Next we discuss the nature and effect of these inconsistencies.

2. Distorted features can lead to higher OOD error. Consider a toy example (Figure 2) where  $d = 2$  and the dimensionality of the representations  $k = 1$ . The linear head is a scalar quantity that denotes

Figure 2: A toy version of our theory illustrating why fine-tuning distorts features, with inputs in 2D. Given input  $x$ , the ground truth output is  $y = w_{\star}^{\top}x$ . We have a single training example  $x_{\mathrm{id}}$  and the pretrained feature extractor is  $B_0$ . (a) Linear probing learns  $w_{\mathrm{lp}}$ , a scaling of the pre-trained features that gets  $x_{\mathrm{id}}$  correct ( $w_{\mathrm{lp}}$  and  $w_{\star}$  have the same projection onto  $x_{\mathrm{id}}$ , vertical dotted line). (b) Fine-tuning updates the pretrained feature extractor along the training direction  $x_{\mathrm{id}}$  to get  $B_{\mathrm{ft}}$ , and then learns a scaling of these features that gets  $x_{\mathrm{id}}$  correct. While both methods get  $x_{\mathrm{id}}$  correct, fine-tuning makes large errors on  $x_{\mathrm{odd}}$ , because fine-tuning updates  $B_0$  along  $x_{\mathrm{id}}$  but not  $x_{\mathrm{odd}}$ .  
(b) Toy example (fine-tuning)

how much the features have to be scaled by. Suppose the ID-subspace is the  $x$ -axis. There are different ways of fitting the ID subspace depending on the base features as shown in the figure—both fine-tuned and linear probed estimators match the true parameter in the ID subspace. If the base features are optimal or scaled versions of the optimal, constraints on the ID subspace are sufficient to get good performance in all orthogonal subspaces as well. However, in FT, the features change only for inputs in the ID subspace (see (1)) and thus the updated features are not simply scaling but distortions where even if the ID error is low, error in subspaces orthogonal to the ID subspace can be high, leading to high worst-case OOD error.

The only way the pretrained features are not distorted and only scaled during FT is if the initial features  $B_{0}$  is exactly aligned with the ID subspace (i.e. the subspace of training data). In Figure 2, if  $B_{0}$  is along the  $x$ -axis, then updating the features exclusively along the  $x$ -axis would simply scale the initial features and not distort them. In this case, the OOD error would not change during FT. However, if the angle is non-zero, the updates would lead to distortions. This motivates our mild non-degeneracy condition where we require the "coverage-angle" to be non-zero.

Definition 3.1 (principal-angle). Let  $E$  and  $F$  be matrices with orthonormal columns (orthogonal and unit norm) whose columns span  $R$  and  $S^{\perp}$ . Recall that  $k = \dim(R)$ . We define  $\cos \theta_k(R, S^{\perp}) = \sigma_k(E^T F)$  which is the  $k$ -th largest singular value of  $E^{\top} F$ .

# 3.2.2 GENERAL RESULT ON THE OOD ERROR OF FINE-TUNING

Our main theorem says that the OOD error of fine-tuning is high.

Theorem 3.1. In the overparameterized linear setting let  $S^{\perp} = \text{rowspace}(X)^{\perp}$ ,  $R = \text{rowspace}(B_0)$ , and  $v_{\star}, B_{\star}$  be the optimal parameters with  $w_{\star} = B_{\star}v_{\star}$ . If  $\cos \theta_k(R, S^{\perp}) > 0$ , then for all  $t$  the OOD error of the fine-tuning iterates  $(B_{\mathbf{ft}}(t), v_{\mathbf{ft}}(t))$  is lower bounded:

$$
\sqrt {L _ {\mathrm {o o d}} \left(v _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t) , B _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t)\right)} \geq \frac {\cos \theta_ {k} \left(R , S ^ {\perp}\right)}{\sqrt {k}} \frac {\min  \left(\varphi , \varphi^ {2} / \| w _ {\star} \| _ {2}\right)}{\left(1 + \| w _ {\star} \| _ {2}\right) ^ {2}} - \epsilon , \tag {3.7}
$$

where  $\varphi^2 = (v_0^\top v_\star)^2 - (v_\star^\top v_\star)^2$  is defined to be initial head alignment error and  $\epsilon = \min_U \| B_0 - UB_\star\|_2^2$  (over rotation matrices  $U$ ) is the error in the pretrained feature extractor.

Proof sketch. Since the features do not change for examples in  $S^{\perp}$  (perpendicular to the training data), we show that in order to achieve low error on  $S^{\perp}$  the linear head  $v_{\mathrm{ft}}(t)$  would have to become the optimal  $v_{\star}$  at some time  $t$ . The head initialization  $v_{0}$  is random and likely to be far from  $v_{\star}$  (measured by the alignment error  $\varphi$ ), so the head would have to change a lot for this. As we see from the fine-tuning gradient flow (3.2),  $v_{\mathrm{ft}}(t)$  and  $B_{\mathrm{ft}}(t)$  change in a "coupled" manner, and a "balancedness" invariant in Du et al. (2018) holds across the fine-tuning trajectory. Correspondingly, if  $v_{\mathrm{ft}}(t)$  changes a lot the features  $B_{\mathrm{ft}}(t)$  also change a lot—we show that this change would lead to

high error on other examples (specifically, examples in  $S$ ). Either ways, fine-tuning would get some subspace of examples wrong, leading to high OOD error. The full proof appears in Appendix A.

Interpretations of various quantities. Quality of pretrained features  $(\epsilon)$ . To unpack the bound consider a special case where the pretrained features are perfect  $(\epsilon = 0)$ . With perfect features, Proposition A.2 shows that linear probing gets zero OOD error. Theorem 3.1 shows that  $L_{\mathrm{odd}}(v_{\mathrm{ft}}(t), B_{\mathrm{ft}}(t)) > 0$  at all times  $t$  so fine-tuning underperforms when the features are perfect.

Alignment error of random head initialization  $(\varphi)$ . The lower bound increases as  $\varphi$  increases i.e. alignment error increases. The gradient updates to the head and base parameters are coupled. If the head was initialized perfectly at  $v_{\star}$ , then fine-tuning updates would not increase the OOD error. However, when the head is randomly initialized as is standard in fine-tuning, the alignment error is high, leading to high OOD error. We use this insight in Section 3.4 to show that smarter head initialization (namely via first linear probing) improves OOD performance of fine-tuning.

# 3.3 LINEAR PROBING VS FINE-TUNING

In this section, we use our main theorem on fine-tuning (Theorem 3.1) and adapt prior work on linear probing to show for a simple Gaussian data distribution that LP is better than FT, OOD. We assume each training example  $X_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$ .

Theorem 3.2. In the linear overparameterized setting, suppose the training data is Gaussian, and recall that  $\epsilon$  is the error in the pretrained feature extractor. Then as the feature extractor error  $\epsilon$  goes to 0, linear probing does much better than fine-tuning OOD:

$$
\frac {L _ {\mathrm {o o d}} \left(v _ {\mathrm {l p}} ^ {\infty} , B _ {0}\right)}{L _ {\mathrm {o o d}} \left(v _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t) , B _ {\mathrm {f t}} (t)\right)} \xrightarrow {p} 0, a s \epsilon \rightarrow 0 \tag {3.8}
$$

This holds for all times  $t$  for  $FT$  (and therefore also for the limit  $v_{\mathrm{ft}}^{\infty}, B_{\mathrm{ft}}^{\infty}$ ) and the  $LP$  iterates converge to  $v_{\mathrm{lp}}^{\infty}, B_0$  as a result of the gradient flow on a convex problem.

Intuitively, if the pretrained features are good, LP learns the optimal linear head which has small OOD error while Theorem 3.1 provides a lower bound on the OOD error for fine-tuning. In Appendix A, we also give a threshold  $T$  (in terms of  $d, n, k$ ) where LP does better than FT if  $\epsilon < T$ .

ID vs OOD error tradeoffs. Until now, we focused on the OOD error and showed how FT can have higher OOD error than LP. However, in practice, we also care about the in-distribution ID error. How do the two methods compare in their ID performance?

For simplicity, we consider the "ID subspace loss" which measures the maximum loss over points in the subspace of training data  $(S)$ . This allows us to work without distributional assumptions on  $P_{\mathrm{id}}$  but it is straightforward to extend to particular distributions. See Appendix A for a formal definition and relationship between ID subspace loss and ID test loss for Gaussian distribution.

If the pretrained initialization is perfect, i.e.  $B_0 = B_\star$ , then both LP and FT get zero  $L_{\mathrm{id:subspace}}$  as they can fit the training data perfectly in an overparameterized setting. But if  $B_0 \neq B_\star$ , there may not be a linear head on  $B_0$  that fits the training data perfectly and LP can have high ID error. FT, on the other hand, can update the features to find a new  $B_{\mathrm{ft}}^\infty$  that can fit the training data perfectly with a linear head  $v_{\mathrm{ft}}^\infty$ . We state the formal proposition below relating the ID errors of the two methods.

Proposition 3.1. Suppose  $w_{\star} = B_{\star}^{\top} v_{\star} \notin \text{rowspace}(B_0)$ , and that fine-tuning converges to a local minimum of its loss, then fine-tuning does better  $ID$ :  $L_{\text{id:subspace}}(v_{\text{ft}}^{\infty}, B_{\text{ft}}^{\infty}) < L_{\text{id:subspace}}(v_{\text{lp}}^{\infty}, B_0)$ .

To summarize, we proved that in a simple Gaussian setting, there are tradeoffs between ID and OOD error: FT has lower ID error but higher OOD error than LP. In the next section, we extend our theoretical insights to show that a simple variant of FT can mitigate such tradeoffs.

# 3.4 LINEAR PROBING THEN FINE-TUNING: A SIMPLE VARIANT TO MITIGATE TRADEOFFS

The advantage of fine-tuning is it can adapt both the feature extractor and head to fit the downstream task. Can we keep this benefit while ensuring that our OOD error is low when we have good pretrained features?

Going back to Theorem 3.1, we see that the alignment error in the head initialization  $\varphi^2 = (v_0^\top v_\star)^2 - (v_\star^\top v_\star)^2$  plays an important role. The issue with FT was that under random initialization,  $\varphi$  is usually large and since the gradient updates to the base parameter are coupled with that

of the head parameter, the base features get distorted in a manner that increases the OOD error. This suggests that we should use a better head initialization—one obtained from linear probing. If the pretrained features are decent, a linear probed head would be much better aligned with  $v_{\star}$  allowing the base features to be updated in a manner that does not increase the OOD error. We formally prove this intuition in a simple setting below.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We run experiments on six benchmark datasets with deep neural networks and see that given good pretrained features, fine-tuning does better ID but worse OOD than linear probing. As predicted by the theory, we find that LP-FT does better than both methods. Finally, we see that a number of predictions from the feature distortion theory hold up in practice. The datasets we use are:

- **DomainNet** (Peng et al., 2019) is a standard domain adaptation dataset. Here, our ID dataset contains 'sketch' images (e.g., drawings of apples, elephants, etc), and the OOD dataset contains 'real', 'clipart', and 'painting' images of the same categories. We use the version of the dataset from Tan et al. (2020).  
- Living-17 and Entity-30 are sub-population shift datasets from the BREEDS benchmark (Santurkar et al., 2020). For example, in Living-17 the goal is to classify an image as one of 17 animal categories such as 'bear'—the ID dataset contains images of black bears and sloth bears and the OOD dataset has images of brown bears and polar bears.  
- FMoW Geo-shift is adapted from the satellite remote sensing dataset 'Functional Map of the World' (Christie et al., 2018; Koh et al., 2021). The goal is to classify a satellite image into one of 62 categories such as 'impoverished settlement'. Our ID dataset contains images from North America, and the OOD dataset contains images from Africa and Europe.  
- CIFAR-10  $\rightarrow$  STL is another standard domain adaptation dataset (French et al., 2018), where the ID is CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009), and the OOD is STL (Coates et al., 2011).  
- CIFAR-10  $\rightarrow$  CIFAR-10.1 (Recht et al., 2018) is a dataset collected using a very similar protocol to CIFAR-10, and the authors describe it as "a minute distributional shift". The hope is that a classifier trained on CIFAR-10 gets high accuracy on CIFAR-10.1.

Pretraining and models. We use a ResNet-50 architecture for our experiments. We consider a diverse range of pretraining methods and datasets: MoCo-v2 (Chen et al., 2020b), CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), and MoCo-TP (Ayush et al., 2020)—see Appendix B for details.

# 4.1 LINEAR PROBING VS FINE-TUNING

Experiment protocols. We initialize with the pretrained model, and fine-tune or linear probe on ID training examples. For fine-tuning on each dataset we swept over 6 learning rates, using a cosine learning rate schedule and batch size of 64. We early stop and choose the best learning rate using ID validation accuracy. For linear probing we train an  $\ell2$ -regularized logistic regression classifier on frozen features from the penultimate layer of the pretrained model, selecting the best  $\ell2$ -regularization hyperparameter based on ID validation accuracy. For all methods, we run each hyperparameter configuration 3 times (with different random seeds), and take the average accuracy. OOD data was only used for evaluation. For more details, see Appendix B.

Results. Fine-tuning does better than linear probing on 4 out of 5 ID datasets (average accuracy of  $85.8\%$  vs  $83.5\%$  for linear probing, see Table 1). This is consistent with prior work and intuitions. However, OOD, linear-probing does better on 5 out of 6 distribution shift datasets (average accuracy of  $71.6\%$  for linear probing vs  $66.8\%$  for fine-tuning, see Table 2). Our datasets vary in size from 20K examples to 150K examples, so this doesn't appear to be simply because of sample size.

Table 1: ID accuracies with  $90\%$  confidence intervals over 3 runs—fine-tuning does better than linear probing on all datasets except DomainNet. LP-FT does the best on all except FMoW where it is in between linear probing and fine-tuning.

# 4.2 LINEAR PROBING THEN FINE-TUNING (LP-FT)

Experiment protocols. For LP-FT, we initialize the neural network head using the linear probed solution, and then fine-tune the model. LP-FT and fine-tuning use similar compute because the linear probing step is much faster than fine-tuning. As with fine-tuning, we sweep over 6 learning rates, early stopping using ID validation accuracy (more details are in Appendix B).

Results. We find that LP-FT gets the best accuracy ID (average:  $86.5\%$  ) and OOD (average:  $76.5\%$ ). This is true for 4/5 ID and 6/6 OOD datasets—every dataset except FMoW ID, where LP-FT is better than linear probing but worse than fine-tuning. Since the ID accuracy on FMoW is low  $(56.5\%)$ , this could be because the pretrained features are not good.

# 4.3 EXAMINING THE FEATURE DISTORTION THEORY

Early stopping. Our theory predicts that fine-tuning would do worse OOD throughout the process of fine-tuning, and not just at the end. Here, we early stop each fine-tuning method and choose the best learning rate based on target validation accuracy. As expected, fine-tuning does improve a little, but linear probing (average accuracy:  $73.0\%$ ) is still better than fine-tuning (average accuracy:  $70.1\%$ ). See Appendix B for per-dataset results.

ID-OD features get distorted. The feature distortion theory predicts that fine-tuning changes features for ID examples more than for OOD examples, which is why fitting a head on ID examples performs poorly OOD. The theory also predicts that LP-FT changes the features less than fine-tuning does. For each example in Living-17, we took the Euclidean distance of the ResNet-50 features before and after fine-tuning. As expected, the average distance for ID examples (0.019) is more than for OOD examples (0.017), and both distances are  $20 \times$  smaller for LP-FT.

Pretrained features must be good, ID-OOD far apart. Our theory says that linear probing does better than fine-tuning OOD, but only if the OOD and ID data are quite different, and the pretrained features are good—otherwise fine-tuning can do better OOD by adjusting the feature extractor ID.

Feature quality: We use a checkpoint of MoCo that got  $10\%$  worse accuracy (on ImageNet) and compare linear probing and fine-tuning on Living-17. With worse features, both methods do worse, but fine-tuning  $(96\%$  ID,  $71\%$  OOD) does better than linear probing  $(92\%$  ID and  $66\%$  OOD).

$ID \approx OOD$ : We fine-tune / linear probe on CIFAR-10, and test on CIFAR-10.1, a dataset collected using a similar protocol to CIFAR-10. As expected, fine-tuning (92.3%) outperforms linear probing OOD (82.7%). Even in this case LP-FT does the best (93.5%).

# 5 RELATED WORK AND DISCUSSION

Fine-tuning vs linear probing. Fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP) are popular transfer learning algorithms. There is substantial evidence of FT outperforming LP in-distribution (ID) including recent large-scale investigations (Kornblith et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021a; Zhai et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020b) (the only notable exception is in Peters et al. (2019) where LP performs better than FT when using ELMo representations, but worse using BERT). FT is therefore the method of choice for improving accuracy, while LP is used to analyze properties of representations (Peters et al., 2018; Belinkov et al., 2017; Hewitt & Manning, 2019). In our work, we find that FT can underperform LP especially when using high quality pretrained features in the presence of a large distribution shift.

The benefit of preserving pretrained features. Our work adds to growing evidence that lightweight fine-tuning where only small parts of a pretrained model are updated, extrapolates better under distribution shifts. Zero-shot language prompting in vision (Radford et al., 2021) and other lightweight fine-tuning approaches in NLP (Houlsby et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Utama et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021) improve OOD performance. In independent and concurrent work, (Andreassen et al., 2021) observe that through the course of fine-tuning, ID accuracy continues to increase but OOD accuracy plateaus. Our work shows something stronger: at no point in the fine-tuning process does FT outperform LP.

Mitigating ID-OOD tradeoffs. While LP-FT has sometimes been used as a fine-tuning heuristic, we show that it addresses the ID-OOD tradeoff theoretically and empirically. Tradeoffs between ID and OOD accuracy are widely studied and prior work self-trains on large amounts of unlabeled data to mitigate such tradeoffs (Raghunathan et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2021; Khani & Liang, 2021). In contrast, our approach uses no extra unlabeled data and is a simple variant of fine-tuning. In concurrent and independent work, (Wortsman et al., 2021) show that ensembling the weights of a zero-shot and fine-tuned model mitigates the ID-OOD tradeoff between these approaches. Our empirical results are incomparable because they use different pretrained models and datasets.

Theoretical analysis of transfer learning. Prior works look at ID error (Wu et al., 2020; Tripuraneni et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020), while we look at OOD error. In recent work (Chua et al., 2021) study regularized fine-tuning in an underparameterized regime where there is a unique global optimum. In contrast, our analysis deals with the overparameterized regime (mirroring modern settings of zero train loss) where we need to analyze the trajectory of fine-tuning from the pretrained initialization because there is no unique optimizer of the objective function. See Section C for additional related work on theory of overparameterized models.

Conclusion. There is a strong trend towards leveraging pretrained models to improve downstream performance, and whenever feasible, it is common to fine-tune all model parameters. In this work, we show theoretically and empirically that preserving features might be important for robustness, and simpler approaches like linear-probing can improve OOD performance. This gap between  $FT$  and  $LP$  grows as the quality of pretrained features improve, so we believe our results are likely to gain significance over time with growing innovations and scale of pretraining.

Theoretical understanding of modern deep learning remains limited, especially the effect of pretraining and transfer learning. In addition to our specific results on fine-tuning, our work introduces some tools and ideas for dealing with the main challenge of characterizing properties of the trajectory from a specific initialization in the presence of multiple global optima (implicit regularization effect of initialization). There are several open questions and extensions such as dealing with nonlinear activations, different layerwise learning rates, and the effect of explicit regularization.

Finally, there are often tradeoffs between ID and OOD performance and we showed that the simple variant of LP-FT can mitigate these tradeoffs in our context. We believe LP-FT is just a first step in leveraging the intuition from our theoretical analysis and hope that this work inspires new methods of leveraging powerful pretrained models.

Reproducibility: We include proofs for our theoretical results in Appendix A, additional experiment details in Appendix B, and include anonymized source code.
