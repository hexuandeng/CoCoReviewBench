# ABSTRACT

The driving force behind deep networks is their ability to compactly represent rich classes of functions. The primary notion for formally reasoning about this phenomenon is expressive efficiency, which refers to a situation where one network must grow unfeasibly large in order to replicate functions of another. To date, expressive efficiency analyses focused on the architectural feature of depth, showing that deep networks are representationally superior to shallow ones. In this paper we study the expressive efficiency brought forth by connectivity, motivated by the observation that modern networks interconnect their layers in elaborate ways. We focus on dilated convolutional networks, a family of deep models delivering state of the art performance in sequence processing tasks. By introducing and analyzing the concept of mixed tensor decompositions, we prove that interconnecting dilated convolutional networks can lead to expressive efficiency. In particular, we show that even a single connection between intermediate layers can already lead to an almost quadratic gap, which in large-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is practical and one that is not. Empirical evaluation demonstrates how the expressive efficiency of connectivity, similarly to that of depth, translates into gains in accuracy. This leads us to believe that expressive efficiency may serve a key role in developing new tools for deep network design.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

One of the key attributes fueling the success of deep learning is the ability of deep networks to compactly represent rich classes of functions. This phenomenon has drawn considerable attention from the theoretical machine learning community in recent years. The primary notion for formally reasoning about the representational abilities of different models is expressive efficiency. Given two network architectures  $A$  and  $B$ , with size parameters (typically the width of layers across a network)  $r_A$  and  $r_B$ , we say that architecture  $A$  is expressively efficient w.r.t. architecture  $B$  if the following two conditions hold: (i) any function realized by  $B$  with size  $r_B$  can be realized (or approximated) by  $A$  with size  $r_A \in \mathcal{O}(r_B)$ ; (ii) there exist functions realized by  $A$  with size  $r_A$  that cannot be realized (or approximated) by  $B$  unless its size meets  $r_B \in \Omega(f(r_A))$  for some superlinear function  $f$ . The nature of the function  $f$  in condition (ii) determines the type of efficiency taking place – if  $f$  is exponential then architecture  $A$  is said to be exponentially expressively efficient w.r.t. architecture  $B$ , and if  $f$  is polynomial so is the expressive efficiency of  $A$  over  $B$ .

To date, works studying expressive efficiency in the context of deep learning (e.g. Delalleau and Bengio (2011); Pascanu et al. (2013); Montufar et al. (2014); Telgarsky (2015); Eldan and Shamir (2015); Poole et al. (2016); Raghu et al. (2016); Cohen et al. (2016b); Cohen and Shashua (2016); Poggio et al. (2015); Mhaskar et al. (2016)) have focused on the architectural feature of depth, showing instances where deep networks are expressively efficient w.r.t. shallow ones. This theoretical focus is motivated by the vast empirical evidence supporting the importance of depth (cf. LeCun et al. (2015)). However, it largely overlooks an additional architectural feature that in recent years is proving to have great impact on the performance of deep networks – connectivity. Nearly all state of the art networks these days (e.g. Szegedy et al. (2015); He et al. (2015); Huang et al. (2016b;a)) deviate from the simple feed-forward (chain) approach, running layers connected under various schemes. Whether or not this relates to expressive efficiency remains to be an open question.

A specific family of deep networks gaining increased attention in the deep learning community is that of dilated convolutional networks. These models form the basis of the recent WaveNet (van den Oord et al. (2016)) and ByteNet (Kalchbrenner et al. (2016)) architectures, which provide state of the

art performance in audio and text processing tasks. Dilated convolutional networks are frequently applied to sequence data, and consist of multiple succeeding convolutional layers, each comprising non-contiguous filters with a different dilation (distance between neighboring elements). The choice of dilations directly affects the space of functions that may be realized by a network, and while no choice is expressively efficient w.r.t. another, we show in this work that interconnecting networks with different dilations leads to expressive efficiency, and by this demonstrate that connectivity indeed bears the potential to enhance the expressiveness of deep networks.

Our analysis follows several recent works utilizing tensor decompositions for theoretical studies of deep learning (e.g. Janzamin et al. (2015); Sedghi and Anandkumar (2016)), and in particular, builds on the equivalence between hierarchical tensor decompositions and convolutional networks established in Cohen et al. (2016b) and Cohen and Shashua (2016). We show that with dilated convolutional networks, the choice of dilations throughout a network corresponds to determination of the mode (dimension) tree underlying the respective decomposition. We then define the notion of a mixed tensor decomposition, which blends together multiple mode trees, effectively creating a large ensemble of hybrid trees formed from all possible combinations. Mixed tensor decompositions correspond to mixed dilated convolutional networks, i.e. mixtures formed by connecting intermediate layers of different dilated convolutional networks. This allows studying the expressive properties of such mixtures using mathematical machinery from the field of tensor analysis. We fully analyze a particular case of dilated convolutional arithmetic circuits, showing that a single connection between intermediate layers already leads to an almost quadratic expressive efficiency, which in large-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is practical and one that is not.

An experiment on TIMIT speech corpus (Garofolo et al. (1993)) evaluates the dilated convolutional network architectures covered by our analysis. We find that interconnecting intermediate layers of different networks improves accuracy, with no additional cost in terms of computation or model capacity. This serves as an indication that with the architectural feature of connectivity, similarly to the case of depth, expressive efficiency and improved accuracies go hand in hand. Accordingly, we believe expressive efficiency may serve a key role in developing new tools for deep network design.

# 2 SUMMARY OF OUR ANALYSIS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

For the convenience of the reader, we summarize below the analysis and contributions encompassed in this paper. The summarized material is delivered fully in sec. 3, 4, 5 and the appendices referenced therein. To keep the manuscript at reasonable length, much of the material is located in the appendices. We refer the reader to Anonymous for a longer, self-contained version of the text.

Our analysis begins in sec. 3, where we present the dilated convolutional network underlying WaveNet (fig. 1). We consider this to be the baseline architecture and, following Cohen and Shashua (2016), facilitate its study through tensor analysis. The key to introducing tensors into the framework is a discretization of the network's input-output mapping. Namely,  $f(\mathbf{x}[t - N + 1], \ldots, \mathbf{x}[t]) - a$  function realized by the network ( $t$  here stands for a natural time index), is conceptually evaluated on a finite (exponentially large) number of input points, generated from all possible assignments of the variables  $\mathbf{x}[t - N + 1], \ldots, \mathbf{x}[t]$  to each hold one of  $M$  predetermined values. This gives rise to an  $N$ -dimensional lookup table, with length  $M$  in each axis. We refer to this lookup table as a grid tensor (eq. 1). It is shown (app. C) that grid tensors brought forth by the baseline dilated convolutional network (fig. 1) can be expressed as a hierarchical tensor decomposition, referred to as the baseline decomposition (eq. 2).

The baseline decomposition implicitly adheres to a particular tree over tensor modes (axes). This calls for a generalization, and we indeed define a general mode tree (def. 1), followed by a corresponding hierarchical tensor decomposition, referred to as the tree decomposition (eq. 3). Different choices of mode trees lead to tree decompositions characterizing networks with different dilations. We focus on the tree that corresponds to the baseline network (fig. 2(a)), and on those corresponding to networks obtained by swapping dilations of different layers (fig. 2(b), for example).

Armed with a framework for representing different dilated convolutional networks through hierarchical tensor decompositions of different mode trees, we head on in sec. 4 and introduce the notion of a mixed tensor decomposition (eq. 4). The mixed decomposition of two mode trees  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  is based on a preselected set of nodes present in both trees, referred to as mixture nodes. Individual tree decompositions of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  are run in parallel, where at each mixture node, tensors from the two

decompositions are swapped. If  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  are the dilated convolutional networks characterized by  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  (respectively), the mixed decomposition characterizes a mixed (interconnected) network  $\mathcal{M}$ , formed by rewiring intermediate layers of  $\mathcal{N}$  into  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ , and vice versa (see illustration in fig. 3).

The heart of our analysis is sec. 5, where we study the expressive efficiency of the mixed network  $\mathcal{M}$  over the individual networks  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ . Establishing expressive efficiency requires showing that any function realized by  $\mathcal{N}$  or  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  can be realized by  $\mathcal{M}$  with no more than linear growth in size, whereas the converse does not hold, i.e. there exist functions realizable by  $\mathcal{M}$  that cannot be realized by  $\mathcal{N}$  or  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  unless their size is allowed to grow super-linearly. From a tensor decomposition perspective, this translates to the following two propositions:

(i) any tensor generated by a tree decomposition of  $T$  or  $\bar{T}$  can be realized by their mixed decomposition with no more than linear growth in size;  
(ii) there exist tensors realizable by the mixed decomposition of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  that cannot be realized by their individual tree decompositions without a super-linear growth in size.

We address both propositions through the notion of hybrid mode trees (def. 2; fig. 4), which are simply mode trees born from combinations of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ . We prove (claim 1) that the mixed decomposition of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  can replicate, with no more than linear growth in size, the tree decomposition of any hybrid tree  $H$ . Since  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  are in particular hybrid mode trees of themselves, we obtain an affirmative answer to proposition (i). For addressing proposition (ii), we demonstrate a case (with convolutional arithmetic circuits) where there exists a hybrid tree  $H$  whose tree decomposition generates tensors that require the tree decompositions of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  to grow super-linearly. Since the mixed decomposition of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  can (by claim 1) replicate the tree decomposition of  $H$  with no more than linear growth, proposition (ii) is established, and  $\mathcal{M}$  is indeed expressively efficient w.r.t.  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  (corollary 1).

The central tool for establishing proposition (ii), or more specifically, for demonstrating the existence of a hybrid tree  $H$  whose tree decomposition requires those of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  to grow super-linearly, is a tight analysis of tensors generated by a tree decomposition in terms of their ranks when arranged as matrices (theorem 1). Matricization ranks under hierarchical tensor decompositions are of interest from a pure tensor analysis perspective (cf. Hackbusch (2012)), as well as in the context of deep learning (cf. Cohen and Shashua (2017)). The bounds we provide are much tighter (exact in many cases) and far more general than those existing in the literature, and we expect them to prove useful in different applications. The key idea in deriving these bounds is to consider a matricized form of the tree decomposition, and recursively propagate outwards various matrices (for details see proof of theorem 1 in app. E.2).

To conclude this section, we list below the main contributions of the paper:

- We introduce the notion of a mixed tensor decomposition, and prove that it brings forth a representational advantage compared to the individual hierarchical decompositions it comprises. This development is of interest from a pure tensor analysis perspective, independently of convolutional networks, or machine learning in general.  
- We provide the first formal evidence for the fact that interconnectivity – an architectural feature prevalent in state of the art deep learning, brings forth expressive efficiency.  
- Our central theorem (theorem 1) provides the most comprehensive characterization to date of matricization ranks brought forth by hierarchical tensor decompositions.

# 3 DILATED CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS

Dilated convolutional networks are a family of convolutional networks (LeCun and Bengio (1995)) gaining increased attention in the deep learning community. As opposed to more conventional convolutional architectures (e.g. Krizhevsky et al. (2012)), which are applied primarily to images (and videos), dilated convolutional networks thrive in sequence processing tasks. For example, they underlie Google's WaveNet (van den Oord et al. (2016)) and ByteNet (Kalchbrenner et al. (2016)) models, which provide state of the art performance in audio and text processing tasks.

# 3.1 BASELINE ARCHITECTURE

The dilated convolutional network architecture considered as baseline in this paper is the one underlying WaveNet, depicted in fig. 1. Due to lack of space, we defer its detailed description to app. B,

![](images/49ee95a0a119eed1e2ca54023856d43d767fa119d256686478b1b8b25ae69430.jpg)  
Figure 1: Baseline dilated convolutional network architecture (see description in app. B).

and merely note here that we use  $g(\cdot)$  to denote the function combining two size-1 convolutions into a single size-2 convolution with non-linearity (e.g.  $g(a, b) := \max \{a + b, 0\}$  for ReLU activation).

Our interest lies on the representational abilities of a network, i.e. on the properties of the input-output mappings it can realize. For a fixed time point  $t$ ,  $\mathbf{o}[t]$  - network output at time  $t$ , is a function of  $\mathbf{x}[t - 2^L +1]\ldots \mathbf{x}[t]$  - network input over the last  $2^{L}$  time points. Taking into account temporal stationarity, and denoting for brevity  $N\coloneqq 2^{L}$ , we may write  $o[t]_y = f_y(\mathbf{x}[t - N + 1],\dots ,\mathbf{x}[t])$  for every output coordinate  $y\in [r_L]$ . We study the functions  $\{f_y(\cdot)\}_{y}$ , which obviously depend on the convolution weights  $\{\mathbf{a}^{l,\gamma ,\mathrm{I}},\mathbf{a}^{l,\gamma ,\mathrm{II}}\}_{l,\gamma}$ , through the process of discretization. Namely, we choose a collection of vectors  $\mathbf{v}^{(1)}\ldots \mathbf{v}^{(M)}$ , and for each output coordinate  $y$ , define the following tensor:

$$
\mathcal {A} _ {d _ {1} \dots d _ {N}} ^ {y} := f _ {y} \left(\mathbf {v} ^ {\left(d _ {1}\right)}, \dots , \mathbf {v} ^ {\left(d _ {N}\right)}\right) \quad \forall d _ {1} \dots d _ {N} \in [ M ] \tag {1}
$$

$\mathbf{v}^{(1)} \ldots \mathbf{v}^{(M)}$  are referred to as discretizers, and  $\mathcal{A}^y$  is referred to as the grid tensor of  $f_y(\cdot)$ . The size of a grid tensor is exponential in  $N$ , thus treating it directly is intractable. However, the network admits a compact parameterization of grid tensors in terms of its convolution weights (see app. C, and the preliminaries in app. A):

For  $j = 1\ldots N$

$$
\phi^ {0, j, \gamma} = [ v _ {\gamma} ^ {(1)}, \dots , v _ {\gamma} ^ {(M)} ] ^ {\top} \quad \forall \gamma \in [ r _ {0} ]
$$

For  $l = 1\ldots L, j = 1\ldots N / 2^l$ :

$$
\phi^ {l, j, \gamma} = \left(\sum_ {\alpha = 1} ^ {r _ {l - 1}} a _ {\alpha} ^ {l, \gamma , \mathrm {I}} \cdot \phi^ {l - 1, 2 j - 1, \alpha}\right) \otimes_ {g} \left(\sum_ {\alpha = 1} ^ {r _ {l - 1}} a _ {\alpha} ^ {l, \gamma , \mathrm {I I}} \cdot \phi^ {l - 1, 2 j, \alpha}\right) \quad \forall \gamma \in [ r _ {l} ]
$$

$$
\mathcal {A} ^ {y} = \phi^ {L, 1, y} \quad \forall y \in [ r _ {L} ] \tag {2}
$$

This parameterization is in fact a hierarchical tensor decomposition. To highlight its correspondence to the baseline dilated convolutional network (fig. 1), we refer to it as the baseline decomposition.

# 3.2 DILATIONS AND MODE TREES

The baseline decomposition (eq. 2), corresponding to the baseline dilated convolutional network (fig. 1), implicitly adheres to a tree structure<sup>1</sup> In this subsection we generalize the underlying tree, and show that the resulting decompositions capture networks with various dilations throughout their convolutional layers. We begin by defining a general (binary) tree over tensor modes:

Definition 1. Let  $N \in \mathbb{N}$ . A binary mode tree $^2$  over  $[N]$  is a full binary tree $^3$  in which:

- Every node is labeled by a subset of  $[N]$  
- There are exactly  $N$  leaves, labeled  $\{1\} \ldots \{N\}$  
- The label of an interior (non-leaf) node is the union of the labels of its children

If  $T$  is a binary mode tree, we identify its nodes with their labels, i.e. with the corresponding subsets of  $[N]$ . The set of all interior nodes is denoted by  $\text{int}(T) \subset 2^{[N]}$ ; the children of an interior node  $\nu \subset [N]$  are denoted by  $C_I(\nu; T)$ ,  $C_{II}(\nu; T) \subset [N]$ ; and the parent of a non-root node  $\nu \subset [N]$  is denoted by  $P(\nu; T)$ . Notice that by definition, the root node is labeled  $[N]$ .

Recall the definition of grid tensors  $\{\mathcal{A}^y\}_{y}$  (eq. 1), and let  $T$  be a binary mode tree over  $[N]$ .  $T$  induces a hierarchical decomposition of the grid tensors, referred to as its tree decomposition:

For  $j = 1\ldots N$

$$
\phi^ {\{j \}, \gamma} = \left[ v _ {\gamma} ^ {(1)}, \dots , v _ {\gamma} ^ {(M)} \right] ^ {\top} \quad \forall \gamma \in [ r ]
$$

For  $\nu$  in  $int(T)$  (depth-first order):

$$
\phi^ {\nu , \gamma} = \sigma^ {(\nu ; T)} \left(\left(\sum_ {\alpha = 1} ^ {r} a _ {\alpha} ^ {\nu , \gamma , \mathrm {I}} \cdot \phi^ {C _ {\mathrm {I}} (\nu ; T), \alpha}\right) \otimes_ {g} \left(\sum_ {\alpha = 1} ^ {r} a _ {\alpha} ^ {\nu , \gamma , \mathrm {I I}} \cdot \phi^ {C _ {\mathrm {I I}} (\nu ; T), \alpha}\right)\right) \quad \forall \gamma \in [ r ]
$$

$$
\mathcal {A} ^ {y} = \phi^ {[ N ], y} \quad \forall y \in [ r ] \tag {3}
$$

To conserve space we defer the annotation of the tree decomposition to app. D, noting that  $r \in \mathbb{N}$  - the number of tensors in each group  $\{\phi^{\nu,\gamma}\}_{\gamma}$ , is referred to as the size constant of the decomposition.

Compare the general tree decomposition (eq. 3) to the baseline decomposition (eq. 2). It is not difficult to see that the latter is a special case of the former, corresponding to a binary mode tree  $T$  that is perfect,[5] and whose depth- $l$  nodes are adjacent sets of size  $N / 2^l$  (fig. 2(a)-right). This implies that such a mode tree, when plugged into the tree decomposition, provides a characterization of the baseline dilated convolutional network (fig. 1), i.e., a network whose dilation in layer  $l$  is  $2^{l-1}$  (fig. 2(a)-left). If we were to choose a different mode tree, the corresponding dilated convolutional network would change.[6] For example, if we swap connections in the mode tree (fig. 2(b)-right), we obtain a decomposition that characterizes a network whose dilations are swapped (fig. 2(b)-left).

# 4 MIXED TENSOR DECOMPOSITIONS

Let  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  be two binary mode trees over  $[N]$  (def. 1). We will now define mixed tensor decompositions, blending together the tree decompositions of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  (eq. 3). A mixed decomposition of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  is obtained by choosing a collection of mixture nodes  $mix(T, \bar{T})$ . These are nodes (subsets of  $[N]$ ) that reside in the interior of both  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ , defining locations in the tree decompositions at which tensors will be exchanged. If  $mix(T, \bar{T})$  is chosen as the empty set, the mixed decomposition simply sums the output tensors generated by the tree decompositions of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ . Otherwise, the tree decompositions of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  progress in parallel, until reaching a mixture node  $\mu \in mix(T, \bar{T})$ , where they exchange tensors between them. The process continues until all mixture nodes are visited and the root node (of both trees)  $[N]$  is reached. At this point tensors are summed and returned as output. The formal definition of the mixed decomposition, annotated in detail in app. D, is as follows:

1: For  $j = 1 \dots N$ :  
2:  $\phi^{\{j\},\gamma} = \bar{\phi}^{\{j\},\gamma} = [v_{\gamma}^{(1)},\dots,v_{\gamma}^{(M)}]^{\top}\quad \forall \gamma \in [r]$  
3: For  $\mu$  in  $mix(T, \bar{T}) \cup \{[N]\}$  (inclusion order):  
4: For  $\nu$  in  $int(T) \cap 2^{\mu} \setminus \{ \text{nodes in } T \text{ already visited} \}$  (inclusion order):  
5:  $\phi^{\nu,\gamma} = \sigma^{(\nu;T)}\left(\left(\sum_{\alpha=1}^{r}a_{\alpha}^{\nu,\gamma,\mathrm{I}}\cdot\phi^{C_{\mathrm{I}}(\nu;T),\alpha}\right) \otimes_{g}\left(\sum_{\alpha=1}^{r}a_{\alpha}^{\nu,\gamma,\mathrm{II}}\cdot\phi^{C_{\mathrm{II}}(\nu;T),\alpha}\right)\right) \forall \gamma \in [r]$  
6: For  $\bar{\nu}$  in  $int(\bar{T})\cap 2^{\mu}\setminus \{\mathrm{nodes~in} \bar{T}$  already visited} (inclusion order):  
7:  $\bar{\phi}^{\bar{\nu},\gamma} = \sigma^{(\bar{\nu};\bar{T})}\left(\left(\sum_{\alpha = 1}^{r}\bar{a}_{\alpha}^{\bar{\nu},\gamma,\mathrm{I}}\cdot \bar{\phi}^{C_{\mathrm{I}}(\bar{\nu};\bar{T}),\alpha}\right)\otimes_{g}\left(\sum_{\alpha = 1}^{r}\bar{a}_{\alpha}^{\bar{\nu},\gamma,\mathrm{II}}\cdot \bar{\phi}^{C_{\mathrm{II}}(\bar{\nu};\bar{T}),\alpha}\right)\right) \forall \gamma \in [r]$  
8: Swap  $\phi^{\mu, \gamma} \longleftrightarrow \bar{\phi}^{\mu, \gamma}$ $\forall \gamma \in [r/2]$  
9:  $\mathcal{A}^y = \phi^{[N],y} + \bar{\phi}^{[N],y}\quad \forall y\in [r]$  (4)

Figure 3: To be viewed in color. (a) Two mode trees  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  (given on the right of fig. 2), along with a possible choice of mixture nodes  $mix(T, \bar{T})$  for the mixed decomposition (eq. 4). (b) Mixed dilated convolutional network corresponding to chosen mixed decomposition. Networks  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  associated with  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  (fig. 2, left) are combined through output summation and rewiring of an intermediate convolutional layer (green).

Let  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  be the dilated convolutional networks whose input-output mappings are characterized by the tree decompositions of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  (respectively). The mixed decomposition of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  (eq. 4) characterizes the input-output mapping of a mixed dilated convolutional network, formed by summing the outputs of  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ , and interconnecting their intermediate layers. The choice of mixture nodes  $mix(T,\bar{T})$  effectively determines the locations at which networks  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  are interconnected, where an interconnection simply wires into  $\mathcal{N}$  outputs of a convolutional layer in  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ , and vice versa. For example, suppose that  $\bar{\mathcal{N}},\bar{\mathcal{N}},T$  and  $\bar{T}$  are the networks and trees portrayed in fig. 2. A possible choice of mixture nodes, and the resulting mixed network, are illustrated in fig. 3.

# 5 EXPRESSIVE EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

As in sec. 4, let  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  be two dilated convolutional networks whose input-output mappings are characterized by the tree decomposition (eq. 3) with mode trees  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  respectively. Consider the mixed decomposition (eq. 4) resulting from a particular choice of mixture nodes  $mix(T,\bar{T})$ , and denote its corresponding mixed dilated convolutional network by  $\mathcal{M}$ . We would like to show that  $\mathcal{M}$  is expressively efficient w.r.t.  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ . This amounts to addressing the following two propositions:

Proposition 1. Consider a tree decomposition (eq. 3) with underlying mode tree  $T$  or  $\bar{T}$  and size constant  $r = r_{tree}$ . This decomposition can be realized by a mixed decomposition of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  (eq. 4) whose size constant  $r$  is linear in  $r_{tree}$ .

Proposition 2. Consider a mixed decomposition of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  (eq. 4) with size constant  $r = r_{mix}$ . This decomposition can generate grid tensors  $\{\mathcal{A}^y\}_y$  that cannot be generated by tree decompositions of  $T$  or  $\bar{T}$  (eq. 3) unless their size constant  $r$  is super-linear in  $r_{mix}$ .

As a first step in treating prop. 1 and 2, we define the notion of a hybrid mode tree:

Definition 2. Let  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  be binary mode trees over  $[N]$  (def. 1), and let  $mix(T, \bar{T})$  be a corresponding collection of mixture nodes, i.e., a set of nodes (subsets of  $[N]$ ) contained in the interior of both  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ . We say that  $H$  is a hybrid mode tree of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  w.r.t.  $mix(T, \bar{T})$ , if it is a binary mode tree over  $[N]$ , whose interior may be generated by the following process:

![](images/2b9da5383bfe5af488996471c8d480df0b0cf4bf59382163fa6b8576b9dd1226.jpg)  
Figure 4: Best viewed in color. (a) Two mode trees  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  along with a possible choice of mixture nodes (same as in fig. 3(a)). (b) Sample of the resulting hybrid mode trees (def. 2).

$$
i n t (H) = \emptyset
$$

For  $\mu$  in  $mix(T,\bar{T})\cup \{[N]\}$  (inclusion order):

$$
S = \operatorname {i n t} (T) \cap 2 ^ {\mu} \backslash \left\{\text {n o d e s i n T a l l r e a d y a s s i g n e d t o S} \right\}
$$

$$
\bar {S} = \operatorname {i n t} (\bar {T}) \cap 2 ^ {\mu} \backslash \{\text {n o d e s i n} \bar {T} \text {a l r e a d y a s s i g n e d t o} \bar {S} \}
$$

$$
i n t (H) = i n t (H) \cup S \quad \mathbf {o r} \quad i n t (H) = i n t (H) \cup \bar {S}
$$

In words, for every  $\mu$  that is either a mixture node or the root node,  $int(H)$  includes a segment from either  $int(T)$  or  $int(\bar{T})$ , where the segment comprises all descendants of  $\mu$  from which the path to  $\mu$  does not cross any other mixture node (see illustration in fig. 4).

Claim 1 below states that with proper weight setting, a mixed decomposition of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  (eq. 4) with size constant  $r = r_{\text{mix}}$ , can realize any tree decomposition (eq. 3) with size constant  $r = r_{\text{mix}} / 2$ , if the underlying mode tree is a hybrid of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ . Since  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  are in particular hybrid mode trees of themselves, we obtain an affirmative answer to prop. 1.

Claim 1 (proof in app. E.1). Let  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  be binary mode trees over  $[N]$  (def. 1), and let  $mix(T, \bar{T})$  be a corresponding collection of mixture nodes. Consider a mixed decomposition of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  w.r.t.  $mix(T, \bar{T})$  (eq. 4), and denote its size constant  $r$  by  $r_{mix}$ . Let  $H$  be a hybrid mode tree of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  w.r.t.  $mix(T, \bar{T})$  (def. 2), and consider the respective tree decomposition (eq. 3), with size constant  $r = r_{mix} / 2$ . For any setting of weights  $\{\mathbf{a}^{\nu, \gamma, I}, \mathbf{a}^{\nu, \gamma, II}\}_{\nu, \gamma}$  leading to grid tensors  $\{\mathcal{A}^y\}_{y}$  in this tree decomposition, there exists a setting of weights  $\{\mathbf{a}^{\nu, \gamma, I}, \mathbf{a}^{\nu, \gamma, II}\}_{\nu, \gamma}, \{\bar{\mathbf{a}}^{\bar{\nu}, \gamma, I}, \bar{\mathbf{a}}^{\bar{\nu}, \gamma, II}\}_{\bar{\nu}, \gamma}$  in the mixed decomposition, independent of discretizers  $\{\mathbf{v}^{(i)}\}_{i \in [M]}$ , that leads to the same grid tensors. $^8$

Claim 1 not only addresses prop. 1, but also brings forth a strategy for treating prop. 2. The strategy is to find a hybrid mode tree  $H$  distinct enough from  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$  such that its tree decomposition, which according to claim 1 is easily realized by the mixed decomposition, poses a significant challenge for the individual tree decompositions of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ . Hereinafter we pursue this line of reasoning, focusing on the particular case of convolutional arithmetic circuits  $-g(a,b) = a\cdot b$ . We focus on this special case since it allows the use of a plurality of algebraic tools for theoretical analysis, while at the same time corresponding to models showing promising results in practice (see for example Cohen et al. (2016a); Sharir et al. (2016)).<sup>9</sup>

To crisply phrase our central theorem, we define the notion of an index set tiled by a mode tree:

Definition 3. Let  $T$  be a binary mode tree over  $[N]$  (def. 1), and let  $\mathcal{I} \subset [N]$  be a non-empty set of indexes. A tiling of  $\mathcal{I}$  by  $T$  is a collection of nodes in the tree, denoted  $\Theta(\mathcal{I};T)$ , which meets the following two requirements: (i)  $\cup_{\nu \in \Theta(\mathcal{I};T)} \nu = \mathcal{I}$  (ii)  $\nu \in \Theta(\mathcal{I};T) \Rightarrow P(\nu;T) \notin \mathcal{I}$ . In words,  $\Theta(\mathcal{I};T)$  is a set of nodes in  $T$  whose disjoint union gives  $\mathcal{I}$ , where each node is maximal, i.e., its parent in the tree is not a subset of  $\mathcal{I}$ . See illustration in fig. 6 (supplementary material).

Theorem 1 below provides a tight characterization of grid tensors generated by a tree decomposition in terms of their ranks when matricized (see app. A) w.r.t. an index set. This result is of general interest from both tensor analysis and deep learning perspectives. We use it to establish prop. 2.

Theorem 1 (proof in app. E.2). Let  $T$  be a binary mode tree over  $[N]$  (def. 1), and consider the corresponding tree decomposition (eq. 3) with discretizers  $\mathbf{v}^{(1)} \ldots \mathbf{v}^{(M)}$  spanning  $\mathbb{R}^r$ . Assume that  $g(a, b) = a \cdot b$  (non-generalized decomposition - see app. A), and suppose the generated grid tensors  $\{\mathcal{A}^y\}_{y}$  are matricized (see app. A) w.r.t. an index set  $\mathcal{I} \subset [N]$ ,  $\emptyset \neq \mathcal{I} \neq [N]$ , whose complement we denote by  $\mathcal{I}^c := [N] \backslash \mathcal{I}$ . Then, the ranks of the grid tensor matrices  $\{\llbracket \mathcal{A}^y\rrbracket_{\mathcal{I}}\}_{y}$  are:

- no greater than  $r^{\min}\{|\Theta(\mathcal{I};T)|, |\Theta(\mathcal{I}^{c};T)|\}$  
- at least  $r^{\left|\left\{(\nu_{1}, \nu_{2}) \in \Theta(\mathcal{I}; T) \times \Theta(\mathcal{I}^{c}; T)\right\} : \nu_{1}\right.\right.$  and  $\nu_{2}$  are siblings in  $T$  with depth  $>1\}$  almost always, i.e. for all configurations of weights  $\{\mathbf{a}^{\nu, \gamma, I}, \mathbf{a}^{\nu, \gamma, II}\}_{\nu, \gamma}$  but a set of Lebesgue measure zero

Given two mode trees  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ , with a corresponding collection of mixture nodes  $mix(T, \bar{T})$ , the bounds in theorem 1 can be used to find an index set  $\mathcal{I}$  and a hybrid mode tree  $H$ , such that the tree decomposition of  $H$  generates grid tensors whose ranks under matricization w.r.t.  $\mathcal{I}$  are much higher than those brought forth by the tree decompositions of  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ . This fulfills the strategy described above, thereby establishing prop. 2. In app. F we demonstrate this process with the exemplar setting considered throughout the paper (fig. 2, 3, 4). The following corollary is reached:

Corollary 1. Let  $\mathcal{N}$  be the baseline dilated convolutional network (fig. 1), and let  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  be a network obtained by swapping dilations of groups of  $k$  layers (the case  $k = 2$  is illustrated in fig. 2(b)-left). Denote by  $\mathcal{M}$  the mixed network obtained by summing the outputs of  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ , while interconnecting their  $k$ 'th intermediate layer (and possibly additional layers). Assume the networks' convolutional operator  $g(\cdot)$  is a product. Then, besides a negligible set, all functions realized by  $\mathcal{M}$  with  $r$  channels in the layers of each interconnected network, cannot be realized by  $\mathcal{N}$  (or  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ ) if the number of channels in each of its layers is less than  $(r / 2)^{2 / (1 + 2^{1 - k})}$ .

Corollary 1 (along with claim 1) demonstrates that interconnecting intermediate layers of different dilated convolutional networks can bring forth expressive efficiency. The lower bound in the corollary  $-(r / 2)^{2 / (1 + 2^{1 - k})}$ , is essentially quadratic when  $k \geq 4$ . For example, if  $k = 4$  and the number of channels  $r$  in each interconnected network is 128, the lower bound implies that in order to maintain representational abilities with an individual network, over 1500 channels in each layer are required – far beyond acceptable practice in deep learning.

# 6 EXPERIMENT

To assess the practical implications of the expressive efficiency brought forth by mixing dilated convolutional networks, a simple experiment was conducted. We trained a baseline dilated convolutional network  $\mathcal{N}$  (dilation  $2^{l - 1}$  in layer  $l$  - see sec. 3.1) with architectural parameters similar to those used in WaveNet (van den Oord et al. (2016)), to classify individual phonemes in the TIMIT acoustic speech corpus (Garofolo et al. (1993)). In addition to the baseline model, we also trained a companion network  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$  obtained by swapping dilations of even and odd layers. The mode trees corresponding to these networks (illustrated in fig. 2) -  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ , share interior nodes of even depth, thus any subset of those nodes may serve as mixture nodes for a mixed decomposition (eq. 4). We evaluate mixed dilated convolutional networks  $\mathcal{M}$  corresponding to different choices of mixture nodes (see fig. 3 for illustration of a particular case). Specifically, we consider choices of the following form: mix $(T,\bar{T}) := \{\nu \in int(T)\cap int(\bar{T}):$  depth of  $\nu$  (in  $T$  and  $\bar{T}$ )  $\geq$  threshold\}. Varying the threshold yields mixed networks with a varying number of interconnections. In the extreme case mix $(T,\bar{T}) = \emptyset$  (high threshold),  $\mathcal{M}$  simply sums the outputs of  $\mathcal{N}$  and  $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ . As the threshold decreases interconnections between hidden layers are added - starting from hidden layer 2, then including hidden layer 4, and so on. The intuition from our analysis (sec. 5) is that additional interconnections result in a larger ensemble of hybrid mode trees, which in turn boosts the expressive power of the mixed network  $\mathcal{M}$ . As fig. 5 shows, this intuition indeed complies with the results in practice - classification accuracy improves as we increase the number of interconnections, without any additional cost in terms of computation or model capacity. $^{10}$

It is important to stress that our objective in the experiment was to evaluate, in the most controlled setting possible, the exact models covered by our analysis. We did not compare to state of the art results, as all phoneme recognition rates reported in the literature deviate from our basic setting - they heavily rely on data pre-processing (e.g. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), prediction postprocessing (e.g. Conditional Random Fields), or both. The recent DeepLab model (Chen et al. (2016)) has demonstrated that when combined with other techniques, mixing dilated convolutions can lead to state of the art image segmentation performance. We are currently pursuing similar results in the context of sequence processing tasks.

To conclude this section, we briefly convey implementation details behind the experiment. TIMIT dataset is an acoustic-phonetic corpus comprising 6300 sentences manually labeled at the phoneme level. We split the data into train and validation sets in accordance with Halberstadt (1998), and

Figure 5: Experimental results - increasing the number of interconnections between hidden layers of different dilated convolutional networks improves accuracy, with no additional cost in computation or model capacity.

as advised by Lee and Hon (1989), mapped the 61 possible phoneme labels into 39 plus an additional "garbage" label. The task was then to classify individual phonemes into one of the latter categories. In accordance with WaveNet, the baseline dilated convolutional network had ReLU activation  $(g(a,b) = \max \{a + b,0\} -$  see sec. 3.1), 32 channels per layer, and input vectors of dimension 256 holding one-hot quantizations of the audio signal. The number of layers  $L$  was set to 12, corresponding to an input window of  $N = 2^{L} = 4096$  samples, spanning 250ms of audio signal - standard practice with TIMIT dataset. The framework chosen for running the experiment was Caffe toolbox (Jia et al. (2014)), and we used Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba (2014)) for training (with default hyper-parameters: moment decay rates  $\beta_{1} = 0.9,\beta_{2} = 0.999;$  learning rate  $\alpha = 0.001)$  Weight decay and batch size were set to  $10^{-5}$  and 128 respectively. Models were trained for 35000 iterations, with learning rate decreased by a factor of 10 after  $80\%$  of iterations took place.

# 7 CONCLUSION

Nearly all state of the art deep networks these days (e.g. Szegedy et al. (2015); He et al. (2015); Huang et al. (2016b;a)) deviate from the simple feed-forward (chain) approach, employing various connectivity schemes between their layers. In this paper we studied the representational implications of connectivity in the context of dilated convolutional networks, a family of deep models delivering state of the art performance in audio and text processing tasks, underlying Google's WaveNet (van den Oord et al. (2016)) and ByteNet (Kalchbrenner et al. (2016)). We formulated our study through the notion of expressive efficiency, which refers to a situation where one network must grow unfeasibly large to realize (or approximate) functions of another. Our analysis shows that interconnecting hidden layers of different dilated convolutional networks can bring forth a model that is expressively efficient w.r.t. the individual networks it comprises. In particular, we show that a single connection between hidden layers can already lead to an almost quadratic gap, which in large-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is practical and one that is not. We empirically evaluate the analyzed networks, and find that the expressive efficiency brought forth by interconnectivity coincides with improved accuracies.

To date, formal analyses studying expressive efficiency have focused on the architectural feature of depth, showing instances where deep networks are expressively efficient w.r.t. shallow ones. These studies were motivated by the vast empirical evidence supporting the importance of depth. Our work thus provides a second exemplar of an architectural feature for which expressive efficiency and superior accuracies go hand in hand. This leads us to believe that expressive efficiency may serve a key role in the development of new tools for deep network design.
