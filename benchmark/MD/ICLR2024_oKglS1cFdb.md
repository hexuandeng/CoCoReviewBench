# ABSTRACT

Learning representations that generalize out-of-distribution (OOD) is critical for machine learning models to be deployed in the real world. However, despite the significant effort in the last decade, algorithmic advances in this direction have been limited. In this work, we seek to answer the fundamental question: is learning OOD generalizable representations with only in-distribution data really feasible? We first empirically show that perhaps surprisingly, even with an "oracle" representation learning objective that allows the model to explicitly fit good representations on the training set, the learned model still underperforms OOD in a wide range of distribution shift benchmarks. To explain the gap, we then formally study the OOD generalization of two-layer ReLU networks trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in a structured setting, unveiling an unexplored OOD generalization failure mode that we refer to as feature accompaniment. We show that this failure mode essentially stems from the inductive biases of non-linear neural networks and fundamentally differs from the prevailing narrative of spurious correlations. Overall, our results imply that it may be generally not feasible to learn OOD generalizable representations without explicitly considering the inductive biases of SGD-trained neural networks and provide new insights into the OOD generalization failure, suggesting that OOD generalization in practice may behave very differently from existing theoretical models and explanations.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Robustness to distribution shifts is a critical requirement for machine learning systems to be deployed in the wild (Amodei et al., 2016; Koh et al., 2021). In the last decade, it has proved that the conventional principle of empirical risk minimization (ERM), when combined with (deep) neural networks optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), can lead to remarkable in-distribution (ID) generalization performance with sufficient training data. Unfortunately, this powerful paradigm can also fail catastrophically in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (Torralba & Efros, 2011; Beery et al., 2018; Geirhos et al., 2018; DeGrave et al., 2021), where the test data exhibits distribution shifts stemming from data variations that are not well-covered in training. Due to their ubiquity in the real world, distribution shifts have posed significant challenges to machine learning.

As a result, recent years have witnessed a surge of developing novel learning algorithms to train models that can generalize OOD. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of many of those algorithms has been called into question by several studies (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021; Koh et al., 2021; Wiles et al., 2022), where no tested algorithm exhibits consistent and significant advantage compared with the most "vanilla" baseline ERM. On the other hand, an important observation made by recent work is that increasing the diversity of training data, either through pre-training or though special diverse data augmentation, often yields representations with significant improvement in OOD generalization (Taori et al., 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2021a; Wiles et al., 2022). For example, properly fine-tuning CLIP representations (Radford et al., 2021) has yielded state-of-the-art performance on various distribution shift benchmarks (Wortsman et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022), and it has been empirically observed that such distribution shift robustness heavily depends on the amount and diversity of pre-training data (Fang et al., 2022; Santurkar et al., 2023). This overarching trend leaves some important open questions to be answered, which motivates this work.

On the empirical side, a notable facet of OOD generalization revealed by recent work is that data may outweigh algorithms. However, increasing (pre-)training data also blurs the notion of "OOD" itself since it essentially expands the training distribution: for example, CLIP is trained using a dataset of 400 million image-text pairs, which is at least hundreds of times larger than any existing OOD generalization dataset. Therefore, given the somewhat pessimistic empirical results without more training data, a fundamental question arises regarding the ongoing pursuit of OOD generalization:

Is it really feasible to learn OOD generalizable representations by training on only ID data, in particular, when (i) ID and OOD data do have structural similarities that enable generalization and (ii) ID data is informative enough for extracting such generalizable structures?

On the theoretical side, a large body of work has been devoted to understanding and addressing the OOD generalization failure caused by spurious correlations, which represent the failure mode caused by the model using features that have non-causal relationships with desired outputs. These studies, however, do not give satisfying answers to the above question due to the following two reasons: (i) the majority of existing theory either only considers linear models such as linear classification over prescribed features or neural tangent kernels (NTKs) (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Sagawa et al., 2020b; Nagarajan et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021; Ahuja et al., 2021b;a; Pezeshki et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Rosenfeld et al., 2022; Abbe et al., 2023), or also considers nonlinear models but is optimization-independent (Rosenfeld et al., 2021; Kamath et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2021). Hence, these results may fail to capture the inductive biases of the most widely used model class in practice, i.e., overparametrized non-linear neural networks, for which it is well-known that the implicit biases of SGD optimization is vital to generalization (Zhang et al., 2017). (ii) As we will show in Section 2, the viewpoint of spurious correlations itself is unable to explain some important observations in OOD generalization. Indeed, it has been shown that many OOD generalization algorithms that enjoy provable guarantees in their specific settings do not excel in real-world benchmarks (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021; Koh et al., 2021). Motivated by the gap between theory and practice, we argue that taking into account the inductive biases of non-linear neural networks and SGD may be not only important but also necessary for OOD generalization.

# 1.1 SUMMARY OF OUR RESULTS

In this work, we take steps toward formally answering the above question:

Empirically, we show on 8 common distribution shift datasets that, perhaps surprisingly, even with an "oracle" representation learning objective that allows the model to explicitly fit OOD generalizable pre-trained representations on the training set, the learned representations still perform much worse in OOD generalization than their pre-trained counterparts. This indicates that it may be generally not feasible to learn OOD generalizable representations without explicitly taking into account the inductive biases of non-linear neural networks in many existing benchmarks. Our results challenge the common belief in the community that the empirically observed OOD failure in existing benchmarks is mainly caused by spurious correlations, suggesting a large OOD generalization gap that cannot be explained by spurious correlations or other existing explanations of OOD failure.

Theoretically, we prove that in certain binary classification tasks where the data is generated from OOD generalizable core features and other background features (formally defined in Section 3), a randomly initialized two-layer ReLU neural network trained by SGD can achieve good ID generalization given sufficient data and SGD iterations, yet still fails to generalize OOD. We also show that OOD generalization using neural networks with non-linear activation can be provably different from linear models, which allows us to draw several new conclusions in OOD generalization. Notably, we demonstrate that the above OOD generalization failure differs fundamentally from those in prior work as it holds even when (i) background features are not correlated with the label at all (nullifying the possibility of spurious correlations), (ii) ground-truth labels are perfectly determined by core features (nullifying the possibility of lacking training data or informative features), and (iii) core and background features are not correlated (nullifying the possibility of the innate non-linear entanglement or correlation between core and background features).

Instead, we theoretically prove that at the core of this OOD failure is an unexplored feature learning proclivity of non-linear neural networks that we refer to as feature accompaniment. In brief, feature accompaniment refers to the process where during the learning of core features, SGD-trained neural networks also provably learn a portion of background features simultaneously—even when

background features have no correlation with the label and in the presence of weight decay regularization. We formally show that the reason for this phenomenon is that neurons in the network tend to have asymmetric activation for examples from different classes during training, resulting in non-zero gradient projections onto the span of background features. This further causes the accumulation of background features in the weights of the network during SGD, leading to large OOD risk under the distribution shifts on background features due to the non-linear coupling of core and background features in the neurons' activation. We provide more detailed explanations of why feature accompaniment happens in Section 4, and present empirical evidence suggesting that this explanation matches the observed OOD failure in our experiments. At a high level, we believe that our theoretical finding of feature accompaniment as a novel inductive bias of SGD-trained neural networks can also serve as a new perspective for understanding the existing success and shortcomings of deep learning by characterizing its learned features, complementing known inductive biases such as the simplicity bias of neural networks (Arpit et al., 2017; Shah et al., 2020; Pezeshki et al., 2021).

# 2 OOD GENERALIZABLE REPRESENTATIONS ARE HARD TO LEARN EVEN WHEN EXPLICITLY GIVEN ON ID DATA

We begin our analysis by an experiment motivated by recent algorithmic explorations in OOD generalization: existing algorithms have made various attempts to learn good representations that generalize OOD by designing auxiliary objectives beyond the original training objective of minimizing the empirical prediction risk (see Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz (2021); Koh et al. (2021) and Section E for some examples). However, a major downside of those objectives is that their minimizers may not readily lead to ideal representations. Indeed, many criticisms on those objectives construct hard instances where incorporating spurious features can induce even smaller training risk than the ideal representation that only extracts generalizable features (Kamath et al., 2021; Rosenfeld et al., 2021). Therefore, the limited empirical success of existing objectives does not nullify the possibility that good representations may be learned with "better" objectives. Motivated by this, we would like to ask: what is the very best we can get by representation learning given a finite training set?

An "oracle" representation learning objective. In this work, we empirically approach the above question by introducing an "oracle" representation learning objective that allows the network to explicitly fit given good representations that can generalize OOD. Note that without further prior knowledge on the inductive biases of the model or the task, this is already the best objective we can possibly define since its minimizer can uniquely recover the "right" representations for all examples in the training set. We implement this idea by leveraging large-scale pre-trained models such as CLIP, whose representations have shown remarkable robustness under distribution shifts (Radford et al., 2021). Concretely, given a pre-trained "teacher" encoder, we randomly initialize another "student" encoder with an identical architecture to the teacher encoder. We then train the student encoder by minimizing the Euclidean distance between its output representations and the representations extracted by the teacher encoder on the training set, a process also known as representation distillation. The main difference between our work and existing work on representation distillation is that we focus on OOD generalization with teacher and student models sharing the same architecture, while existing work mainly considers model compression and knowledge transfer between a teacher model and a smaller student model under ID evaluations (Hinton et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2020). In total, our experiments span 8 distribution shift datasets that are extensively benchmarked by the community, including 5 large-scale ImageNet-based natural distribution shift datasets (Taori et al., 2020), 2 in-the-wild distribution shift datasets from WILDS (Koh et al., 2021), and a domain generalization dataset DomainNet (Peng et al., 2019). In those experiments, we employed fully-fledged neural network architectures including Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and ResNets (He et al., 2016). Details of our experiments are provided in Section E.

Evaluation protocol. We evaluate the ID and OOD performance of the pre-trained and distilled representations by training linear probes on top of the representations on the ID training set and then evaluate those linear probes on both ID and OOD test sets. Note that under our protocol, the trained linear probes still need to complete an OOD generalization task on the OOD test sets, albeit with representations instead of raw image pixels as input. To compare the OOD generalization ability of different models, we follow the evaluation protocol of effective robustness proposed by Taori et al. (2020), which quantifies a model's distribution shift robustness as its OOD performance advantage over a baseline representing standard models trained on ID data. We follow Taori et al. (2020);

Results. As shown in Figure 1, linear probes on distilled representations exhibit consistent OOD generalization improvements compared to standard models especially for large datasets such as ImageNet. This is not surprising since our "oracle" distillation objective uses additional representation-level supervision that standard models have no access to. However, we also observe that even with such supervision, the OOD generalization ability of distilled representations still lags far behind compared to pre-trained representations. For example, distilled representations only close about half of the effective robustness gap between standard models and pre-trained representations on average in ImageNet-based datasets, with even worse performance on some datasets with fewer data such as iWildCam and DomainNet. Given the fact that the representation learning objective itself cannot be further improved in general, our result implies that OOD generalizable representations may not be learnable using only ID data without explicitly taking into account the inductive biases of the model or the task. This is consistent with existing observations that even a standard ERM often remains strong in OOD generalization (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021; Koh et al., 2021).

Why does the distilled model still underperform OOD? We first argue that this failure mode is not likely due to spurious correlations since we do not use any label in representation distillation—unlike the scenario where the model picks up spurious features due to their correlations with the

label. Also, due to our experimental protocol, our results can neither be explained by CLIP extracting richer representations of ID data (Zhang et al., 2022; Zhang & Bottou, 2023) (since representation distillation will also learn those rich representations), nor by CLIP extracting more "OOD core features" that are absent in ID data (since the linear probe  $ID$ -trained on top of CLIP representations cannot leverage them to achieve OOD generalization). To further understand this failure, we visualize the prediction heatmaps (using Grad-CAM++ (Chattopadhy et al., 2018)) of our models in DomainNet and a synthetic "gradual" distribution shift scenario based on image style transfer, as shown in Figure 2. An intriguing phenomenon revealed by the visualization is that while the distilled model indeed correctly focuses on the core objects for ID images, its attention to the core objects is gradually weakened under distribution shifts, resulting in OOD failure. Being unaware of any theoretical result that can explain this "weakening" phenomenon, we argue that our observations suggest the existence of a OOD generalization failure mode that is beyond the reach of existing OOD generalization theory and is likely to be tied to the non-linear feature learning process of neural networks. In the following sections, we will formally prove that a novel OOD generalization failure mode, which we refer to as feature accompaniment, indeed exists in certain binary classification tasks with two-layer ReLU networks and has strong connections to our empirical observations.

# 3 THEORETICAL MODEL ON OOD GENERALIZATION

Notation. We use  $[d]$  to denote the set  $\{1, \ldots, d\}$  for positive integers  $d$ ,  $I_d$  to denote the  $d \times d$  identity matrix, and  $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$  to denote the Gaussian distribution with mean  $\boldsymbol{\mu}$  and covariance  $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ . For a set  $S$ , we denote its cardinality by  $|S|$ . For a vector  $\mathbf{u}$ , we denote its  $\ell_2$  norm by  $\|\mathbf{u}\|_2$ . We denote the inner product of two vectors  $\mathbf{u}$  and  $\mathbf{v}$  by  $\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle$ . We use the standard big-O notation:  $O(\cdot)$ ,  $\Omega(\cdot)$ ,  $\Theta(\cdot)$ ,  $o(\cdot)$ , as well as their soft-O variants such as  $\widetilde{\Theta}(\cdot)$  to hide logarithmic factors. For some parameter  $d$ , we use  $\mathrm{poly}(d)$  to denote  $\Theta(d^C)$  with some unspecified large constant  $C$ .

# 3.1 OOD GENERALIZATION PROBLEM AND DATA GENERATION MODEL

We consider a binary classification setting with an input space  $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ , a label space  $\mathcal{Y} = \{-1, 1\}$ , a model class  $\mathcal{H}: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ , and a loss function  $\ell: \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}$ . For every distribution  $\mathcal{D}$  over  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$  and model  $h \in \mathcal{H}$ , the expected risk of  $h \in \mathcal{H}$  on  $\mathcal{D}$  is given by  $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{D}}(h) := \mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \sim \mathcal{D}} \ell(h(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{y})$ . We consider an OOD generalization regime where there are a set of distributions  $\mathbb{D}$  consisting of all distributions to which we would like our model to generalize. Training examples are drawn from a set of training distributions  $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{train}} \subsetneq \mathbb{D}$ , where  $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{train}}$  may contain one or multiple distributions available. Following the most common objective studied by prior work (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Sagawa et al., 2020a; Nagarajan et al., 2021; Rosenfeld et al., 2021; Weber et al., 2022), we aim to select a model  $h \in \mathcal{H}$  to minimize the OOD risk defined as the worst-case expected risk on  $\mathbb{D}$ :

$$
\mathcal {R} _ {\mathrm {O O D}} (h) := \max  _ {\mathcal {D} \in \mathbb {D}} \mathcal {R} _ {\mathcal {D}} (h). \tag {1}
$$

It is clear that without assumptions on  $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{train}}$  and  $\mathbb{D}$ , OOD generalization is impossible since no model can generalize to an arbitrary distribution. Fortunately, real-world distribution shifts are often

structured with some structural similarities shared by different distributions. We can thus hope that such structures can be captured by certain algorithms, leading to models that generalize OOD.

To formalize this, in this work we assume that both ID and OOD data are generated by a dictionary  $M = (m_{1},\ldots ,m_{d_{0}})\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d_{0}}$  consisting of  $d_0$  features with each feature  $m_i\in \mathbb{R}^d$ . Throughout the paper, we work with the case where  $d_0$  is sufficiently large and  $d\in [\Omega (d_0^{2.5})$ ,  $\mathrm{poly}(d_0)$ ]. For simplicity, we assume that every feature has  $\ell_2$  norm  $\| m_i\| _2 = 1$  and different features are orthogonal:  $\forall i\neq j\in [d_0]$ ,  $\langle m_i,m_j\rangle = 0$ , although our results can also be extended to more general cases.

Among all features in  $M$ , we assume that there are  $d_{\mathrm{core}}$  features consistently correlating with the label in all distributions from  $\mathbb{D}$ . We denote the index set of those features by  $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{core}} \subsetneq [d_0]$  and refer to them as core features since they are predictive of the label regardless of distribution shifts. We will refer to the remaining features as background features and denote their index set by  $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{bg}} = [d_0] \setminus \mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{core}}$  with  $d_{\mathrm{bg}} := |\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{bg}}| = d_0 - d_{\mathrm{core}}$ . We assume that  $d_{\mathrm{core}} = \Theta(d_0)$  and  $d_{\mathrm{bg}} = \Theta(d_0)$ . With the above definitions, we now introduce the concrete ID and OOD data generation process.

Definition 1 (ID and OOD data generation). Consider an OOD generalization problem with a training distribution (ID data distribution)  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{train}} \in \mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{train}}$  and a test distribution (OOD data distribution)  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{test}} \in \mathbb{D} \setminus \mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{train}}$ . Each example  $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \sim \mathcal{D} \in \{\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{train}}, \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{test}}\}$  is generated as follows:

1. Sample a label  $\mathbf{y}$  from the uniform distribution over  $\mathcal{V}$ .  
2. Sample a weight vector  $\mathbf{z} = (\mathbf{z}_1, \dots, \mathbf{z}_{d_0}) \in \mathcal{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d_0}$  where different coordinates of  $\mathbf{z}$  are independent random variables generated via the following process:

- ID data  $(\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{train}})$ : for every  $j \in [d_0]$ , sample  $\mathbf{z}_j$  from some distribution  $\mathcal{D}_j$  over  $[0,1]$  such that its moments satisfy  $\mu_{jp} := \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}_j} \mathbf{z}_j^p = \Theta(1)$  for  $p \in [3]$ , and the expected total weight of core features is not less than background features:  $\sum_{j \in S_{\mathrm{core}}} \mu_{j1}^2 - \sum_{j \in S_{\mathrm{bg}}} \mu_{j1}^2 \geq 0$ .  
- OOD data  $(\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{test}})$ : for every  $j \in [d_0]$ , if  $j \in S_{\mathrm{core}}$ , sample  $\mathbf{z}_j$  from  $\mathcal{D}_j^\circ$  over  $[0,1]$ ; if  $j \in S_{\mathrm{bg}}$ , sample  $\mathbf{z}_j$  from some distribution  $\mathcal{D}_j^\prime$  over  $[-1,0]$  such that  $\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}_j^\prime}\mathbf{z}_j = -\Theta(1)$ .

3. Generate  $\mathbf{x} = \sum_{j\in S_{\mathrm{core}}}\mathbf{y}\mathbf{z}_j\pmb {m}_j + \sum_{j\in S_{\mathrm{bg}}}\mathbf{z}_j\pmb {m}_j.$

Remarks on data generation. Our data generation process formalize a natural OOD generalization setting that reflects several important aspects of real-world OOD generalization problems:

- The explicit separation of core and background features captures structural assumptions ensuring that OOD generalization is realistic: under the distribution shifts on background features, there exists a set of core features that enable robust classification. Hence, a model that is insensitive to background features and retains core features can generalize OOD. This rules out the ill-posed cases where the ID data is not informative enough to learn a generalizable model (Tripuraneni et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022) and is also the key intuition of many OOD generalization algorithms aiming to learn invariances (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021).  
- The weights of background features are assumed to be independent of the label in generation, rendering background features and labels uncorrelated. This fundamentally differs from prior OOD generalization analysis (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Sagawa et al., 2020b; Nagarajan et al., 2021; Rosenfeld et al., 2021) where it is assumed that non-core features are spuriously correlated with the label during training and hence may be used by the model.

Connection to experiments. In the prediction heatmap visualization of our models (Figure 2), we include a synthetic OOD scenario based on image style transfer, which closely matches our data model in Definition 1 (keeping core features intact while only changing background features). As shown in our visualization, the prediction heatmaps on synthetic OOD images exhibit visually similar "weakening" patterns as in those of natural OOD images, suggesting that our data model can indeed capture important characteristics of real-world data with distribution shifts.

# 3.2 MODEL AND TRAINING

We consider a model class  $\mathcal{H}$  representing width- $m$  two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation. Formally, given hidden-layer weights  $\mathbf{W} = (\mathbf{w}_1, \dots, \mathbf{w}_m) \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times m}$  and output-layer weights  $\mathbf{a} =$

$(a_{1},\ldots ,a_{m})^{\top}\in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ , the output of a model  $h:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}$  given an input  $\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{X}$  is

$$
h (\mathbf {x}) = \sum_ {k \in [ m ]} a _ {k} \cdot \operatorname {R e L U} \left(\left\langle \mathbf {w} _ {k}, \mathbf {x} \right\rangle\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $\mathrm{ReLU}(u) = \max \{u,0\}$ ,  $u\in \mathbb{R}$ . Similar to practical design choices, we consider an overparameterized setting where  $m\in [\Theta (d_0),\Theta (d)]$  and each weight vector  $\mathbf{w}_k,k\in [m]$  is independently initialized by sampling  $\mathbf{w}_i^{(0)}\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\sigma_0^2\mathbf{I}_d)$  with  $\sigma_0^2 = \frac{1}{d}$ . We randomly initialize output-layer weights  $\mathbf{a}$  by sampling  $a_{k}\sim$  Uniform  $\{-\frac{1}{m},\frac{1}{m}\}$  independently for each  $k\in [m]$ . To simplify our analysis, we keep output-layer weights a fixed throughout training, which is a common assumption in analyzing the optimization and generalization of two-layer neural networks in ID settings (Allen-Zhu & Li, 2021; Karp et al., 2021; Wen & Li, 2021; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2023).

We train the network using SGD over the standard hinge loss  $\ell(y, y') = \max\{1 - yy', 0\}$  with step size  $\eta > 0$  for  $T$  iterations. We consider the most common  $\ell_2$  weight decay with strength  $\lambda = O\left(\frac{d_0}{m^{1.01}}\right)$  for regularization. At each iteration  $t \in \{0, \dots, T-1\}$ , we sample a batch of examples  $\{(\mathbf{x}_i^{(t)}, \mathbf{y}_i^{(t)})\}_{i \in [N]} \sim \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{train}}^N$  with batch size  $N = \mathrm{poly}(d)$ . The empirical loss is then

$$
\widehat {\mathcal {L}} \left(h ^ {(t)}\right) = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i \in [ N ]} \ell \left(h ^ {(t)} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {i} ^ {(t)}\right), \mathbf {y} _ {i} ^ {(t)}\right) + \frac {\lambda}{2} \sum_ {k \in [ m ]} \left\| \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)} \right\| _ {2} ^ {2}, \tag {3}
$$

where we use  $h^{(t)}$  to denote the model parameterized by weights  $\mathbf{W}^{(t)} = (\mathbf{w}_1^{(t)},\dots,\mathbf{w}_m^{(t)})$  at iteration  $t$ . The corresponding SGD update for each weight vector  $\mathbf{w}_k, k\in [m]$  is then given by

$$
\mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t + 1)} = \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)} - \eta \nabla_ {\mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)}} \widehat {\mathcal {L}} (h ^ {(t)}) = (1 - \eta \lambda) \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)} - \eta \nabla_ {\mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)}} \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i \in [ N ]} \ell \left(h ^ {(t)} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {i} ^ {(t)}\right), \mathbf {y} _ {i} ^ {(t)}\right). \tag {4}
$$

# 4 MAIN THEORETICAL RESULTS

In this section, we present our main theoretical results.

Technical challenges. As we have discussed in Section 1, most of existing theoretical work on OOD generalization separates generalization and optimization, studying the global minimizers of their training objectives without considering exact optimization dynamics. By contrast, our setup requires an explicit analysis on the optimization trajectory of SGD, which is known to be challenging due to its non-convex and non-linear nature. Prior work has studied fine-tuning pre-trained models for OOD generalization using two-layer linear networks (Kumar et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023). However, analyzing non-linear networks further requires a careful treatment on the activation property of the neurons, which results in SGD dynamics that fundamentally deviate from linear networks.

Our approach. At a high level, our analysis is based on the construction of two neuron subsets with cardinality  $\Theta(m)$  that are randomly initialized to have large enough expected correlations with the examples from the two classes (i.e., "winning the lottery tickets" (Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2021)). Based on this construction, we apply Berry-Esseen theorem to bound the activation probabilities of the ReLU functions for the neurons in the constructed subsets, iteratively tracking their gradient updates throughout training. This treatment allows us to characterize the output of the network up to constant factors while avoiding the nuisance of analyzing the activation probability of every single neuron in the network, which turns out to be very challenging due to fine-grained SGD dynamics. For ease of presentation, in the sequel we separate our main results into four parts and introduce them progressively. The proofs of all theorems are deferred to Appendix I.

4.1. Neuron activation is asymmetric. Our key insight is that during training, every neuron in the network has the incentive to be positively correlated with examples from at most one class  $\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{pos}}$  (depending on the random initialization of the neuron); we refer to those examples as positive examples  $(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{pos}},\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{pos}})\sim \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{train}}|\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{pos}}$  for this neuron. Correspondingly, we refer to examples from the other class  $\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{neg}}$  as negative examples  $(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{neg}},\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{neg}})\sim \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{train}}|\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{neg}}$ . We can then show that during SGD, at least  $\Theta (m)$  neurons will accumulate (in expectation) positive correlations with  $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{pos}}$  and negative correlations with  $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{neg}}$ . Since ReLU only activates for positive inputs, the activation probability of those neurons would become much larger for  $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{pos}}$  than for  $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{neg}}$ , which we refer to as activation asymmetry and formally demonstrate by the following theorem.

Theorem 1 (Activation asymmetry). For every  $\eta \leq \frac{1}{\mathrm{poly}(d_0)}$  and every  $y \in \mathcal{V}$ , there exists  $T_0 = \widetilde{\Theta} \left( \frac{m}{\eta \sqrt{d}} \right)$  such that with high probability, there are  $\Theta(m)$  neurons whose weights  $\mathbf{w}_k$  satisfy

$$
\mathbf {P r} _ {\mathbf {x} | \mathbf {y} = y \sim \mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {t r a i n}}} [ \langle \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)}, \mathbf {x} \rangle \geq 0 ] = 1 - o (1), \mathbf {P r} _ {\mathbf {x} | \mathbf {y} = - y} [ \langle \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)}, \mathbf {x} \rangle \geq 0 ] = o (1), \forall t \geq T _ {0}. \tag {5}
$$

4.2. Activation asymmetry leads to feature accompaniment. We first note that for every  $k \in [m]$ , the weight vector of the  $k$ -th neuron (in what follows we will also refer to it as the learned feature of the neuron) after  $t$  iterations can be equivalently written as

$$
\mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)} = \sum_ {j \in \mathcal {S} _ {\text {c o r e}}} \left\langle \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)}, \boldsymbol {m} _ {j} \right\rangle \boldsymbol {m} _ {j} + \sum_ {j \in \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {b g}}} \left\langle \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)}, \boldsymbol {m} _ {j} \right\rangle \boldsymbol {m} _ {j} + \text {r e s i d u a l}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\langle \mathrm{residual},\pmb {m}_j\rangle = 0$  for every  $j\in [d_0]$  and thus can be neglected. Intuitively, Eq. (6) indicates that the learned feature can be decomposed into its projections onto different feature vectors. Meanwhile, as we will prove in Section A, the gradient projection onto background features is

$$
\langle - \nabla_ {\mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)}} \widehat {\mathcal {L}} (h ^ {(t)}), \boldsymbol {m} _ {j} \rangle \approx \frac {1}{m} \mathbb {E} _ {(\mathbf {x}, \mathbf {y}) \sim \mathcal {D} _ {\text {t r a i n}}} (\mathbb {1} _ {\mathbf {y} = y} - \mathbb {1} _ {\mathbf {y} = - y}) \cdot \mathbb {1} _ {\left\langle \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(t)}, \mathbf {x} \right\rangle \geq 0} \mathbf {z} _ {j}, \forall j \in \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {b g}}, \forall t \tag {7}
$$

for some  $y \in \mathcal{V}$ , where we omit the weight decay term here for simplicity. By Theorem 1, we have for at least  $\Theta(m)$  neurons,  $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}|_{\mathbf{y} = y}\mathbb{1}_{\langle \mathbf{w}_k^{(t)},\mathbf{x}\rangle \geq 0}$  would be much larger than  $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}|_{\mathbf{y} = -y}\mathbb{1}_{\langle \mathbf{w}_k^{(t)},\mathbf{x}\rangle \geq 0}$ , resulting in a quite positive gradient projection to every background feature  $m_j$ ,  $j \in S_{\mathrm{bg}}$  regardless of its correlation with the label. We refer to this phenomenon as feature accompaniment and illustrate it in Figure 3. Formally, we show that such accumulation would result in learned features containing both core features and some "coupled" background features after enough SGD iterations.

Theorem 2 (Learned features). For every  $\eta \leq \frac{1}{\mathrm{poly}(d_0)}$  and every  $y \in \mathcal{V}$ , after  $T_1 = \Theta \left( \frac{m}{\eta d_0} \right)$  iterations with high probability, there are  $\Theta(m)$  neurons whose weights  $\mathbf{w}_k^{(T_1)}$  satisfy

$$
\sum_ {j \in \mathcal {S} _ {\text {c o r e}}} \mu_ {j 1} \left\langle \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(T _ {1})}, \boldsymbol {m} _ {j} \right\rangle = y \cdot \Theta (1), \quad \sum_ {j \in \mathcal {S} _ {\text {b g}}} \mu_ {j 1} \left\langle \mathbf {w} _ {k} ^ {(T _ {1})}, \boldsymbol {m} _ {j} \right\rangle = \Theta (1). \tag {8}
$$

4.3. Feature accompaniment has negligible impact on ID risk, yet causes large OOD risk. Our next theorem characterizes the impact of feature accompaniment on both ID and OOD risks.

Theorem 3 (ID and OOD risks). For every  $\eta \leq \frac{1}{\mathrm{poly}(d_0)}$ , after at most  $T_{2} = \widetilde{\Theta}\left(\frac{m}{\eta d_{0}}\right)$  iterations with high probability, the trained model  $h^{(T_2)}$  satisfies the following:

$$
\mathcal {R} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\text {t r a i n}}} \left(h ^ {\left(T _ {2}\right)}\right) \leq o (1), \quad \mathcal {R} _ {\mathrm {O O D}} \left(h ^ {\left(T _ {2}\right)}\right) = \Theta (1). \tag {9}
$$

Intuitively, the reason for this result is that the learned model  $h^{(T_2)}$  predicts the label of ID examples using both the learned core features and the "accompanied" background features due to their nonlinear coupling in the neuron's activation. Due to this coupling, negative shift on the magnitude of background features also reduces the overall activation of the neuron, resulting in OOD risk. $^5$

Connection to experiments. We note that the OOD failure mode articulated above also explains our empirical observations in Figure 2, where the model's attention on the core objects gets weakened under distribution shifts—since the Grad-CAM score of each feature map is proportional to

the neuron's activation (Selvaraju et al., 2019), if core and background features are coupled in the activation as shown in Theorem 2, then the shift of background features can make the activation less positive or even negative (i.e., removing the contribution of this neuron to classification), which in turn reduces the Grad-CAM score of core features. Since higher Grad-CAM score corresponds to more saliency in the prediction heatmap, this would result in weakened attention to core objects.

4.4. Linear models are provably free from feature accompaniment. Finally, to further understand the role of non-linearity, we prove that if we "remove" the non-linearity in the model by replacing ReLU with identity functions, then feature accompaniment will no longer exist.

Theorem 4 (Linear networks). If we replace the ReLU functions in the network with identity functions and keep other conditions the same as in Theorem 2, then with high probability, we have  $|\langle \mathbf{w}_k^{(T_1)},\mathbf{m}_j\rangle |\leq \widetilde{O} (\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}})$  for every  $k\in [m]$  and every  $j\in S_{\mathrm{bg}}$

The intuition is that without non-linearity, the activation magnitude for different examples will be no longer asymmetric: for two-layer linear networks, we have the gradient projection akin to Eq. (7) but without the activation derivative  $\mathbb{1}_{\langle \mathbf{w}_k^{(t)},\mathbf{x}\rangle \geq 0}$ . This immediately leads to  $\langle -\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_k^{(t)}}\widehat{\mathcal{L}} (h^{(t)}),\boldsymbol {m}_j\rangle \approx 0$  for every  $j\in S_{\mathrm{bg}}$ , meaning that the background features will not be accumulated during SGD.

As more empirical evidence that corroborates our theory, in Section F.1, we provide numerical experiments in both synthetic classification and representation distillation tasks. In Section F.2, we visualize the features learned by a ResNet-32 on a modified CIFAR-10 dataset, showing that feature accompaniment also happens in deep features learned by neural networks used in practice.

# 5 DISCUSSION

# 5.1 TAKEAWAYS

Takeaway 1: OOD generalization algorithms need to consider inductive biases. Prior algorithmic studies in OOD generalization often motivate and analyze their algorithms in simplified linear settings, which may fail to capture the inductive biases of non-linear neural networks. Our work implies that OOD generalization may not be feasible without considering such inductive biases, calling for explicitly incorporating them into the development of principled OOD generalization algorithms.

Takeaway 2: Non-linearity in neural networks elicits new OOD generalization challenges beyond spurious correlations. As we formally show in Section 4, feature accompaniment is a new OOD generalization challenge that is essentially induced by the non-linearity of SGD-trainied neural networks, being orthogonal to spurious correlations. We believe that this result provides a new perspective on OOD generalization in practice and may inspire new algorithmic designs.

Takeaway 3: Learned features may behave very differently from prescribed ones. Many existing studies on OOD generalization explicitly or implicitly assume that we can directly work on a set of well-separated features. While this assumption helps build intuitions, our results highlight that it can also be misleading since the features learned by neural networks may manifest in a non-linearly coupled manner, thus often diverging from the intuitions for prescribed, well-separated features.

# 5.2 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK

While our work takes a step towards fully understanding OOD generalization in practice, our results still leave much room for improvement such as extensions to more general data distributions, multi-class classification, and more complicated network architectures. More importantly, while our results indicate the innate difficulty in achieving OOD generalization with only ID data, they do not readily explain how pre-training on more diverse data consistently helps OOD generalization as observed in practice. Based on our preliminary experiments, we have the following conjecture:

Conjecture 1. Pre-training on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset alleviates feature accompaniment and leads to more linearized representations, hence improving OOD generalization.

We provide preliminary empirical evidence that supports this conjecture in Section G. However, we believe that formally proving this conjecture may require more fine-grained treatment in the (pre-training) data generation process and the dynamics of SGD, which we leave as future work.
