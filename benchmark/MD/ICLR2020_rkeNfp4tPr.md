# ABSTRACT

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with stochastic momentum is popular in nonconvex stochastic optimization and particularly for the training of deep neural networks. In standard SGD, parameters are updated by improving along the path of the gradient at the current iterate on a batch of examples, where the addition of a "momentum" term biases the update in the direction of the previous change in parameters. In non-stochastic convex optimization one can show that a momentum adjustment provably reduces convergence time in many settings, yet such results have been elusive in the stochastic and non-convex settings. At the same time, a widely-observed empirical phenomenon is that in training deep networks stochastic momentum appears to significantly improve convergence time, variants of it have flourished in the development of other popular update methods, e.g. ADAM (Kingma & Ba (2015)), AMSGrad (Reddi et al. (2018b)), etc. Yet theoretical justification for the use of stochastic momentum has remained a significant open question. In this paper we propose an answer: stochastic momentum improves deep network training because it modifies SGD to escape saddle points faster and, consequently, to more quickly find a second order stationary point. Our theoretical results also shed light on the related question of how to choose the ideal momentum parameter--our analysis suggests that  $\beta \in [0,1)$  should be large (close to 1), which comports with empirical findings. We also provide experimental findings that further validate these conclusions.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

SGD with stochastic momentum has been a de facto algorithm in nonconvex optimization and deep learning. It has been widely adopted for training machine learning models in various applications. Modern techniques in computer vision (e.g. Krizhevsky et al. (2012); He et al. (2016); Cubuk et al. (2018); Gastaldi (2017)), speech recognition (e.g. Amodei et al. (2016)), natural language processing (e.g. Vaswani et al. (2017)), and reinforcement learning (e.g. Silver et al. (2017)) use SGD with stochastic momentum to train models. The advantage of SGD with stochastic momentum has been widely observed (Hoffer et al. (2017); Loshchilov & Hutter (2019); Wilson et al. (2017)). Sutskever et al. (2013) demonstrate that training deep neural nets by SGD with stochastic momentum helps achieving in faster convergence compared with the standard SGD (i.e. without momentum). The success of momentum makes it a necessary tool for designing new optimization algorithms in optimization and deep learning. For example, all the popular variants of adaptive stochastic gradient methods like Adam (Kingma & Ba (2015)) or AMSGrad (Reddi et al. (2018b)) include the use of momentum.

Despite the wide use of stochastic momentum (Algorithm 1) in practice, justification for the clear empirical improvements has remained elusive, as has any mathematical guidelines for actually setting the momentum parameter—it has been observed that large values (e.g.  $\beta = 0.9$ ) work well in practice. It should be noted that Algorithm 1 is the default momentum-method in popular software packages such as PyTorch and Tensorflow<sup>1</sup>. In this paper we provide a theoretical analysis for SGD with

momentum. We identify some mild conditions that guarantees SGD with stochastic momentum will provably escape saddle points faster than the standard SGD, which provides clear evidence for the benefit of using stochastic momentum. For stochastic heavy ball momentum, a weighted average of stochastic gradients at the visited points is maintained. The new update is computed as the current update minus a step in the direction of the momentum. Our analysis shows that these updates can amplify a component in an escape direction of the saddle points.

In this paper, we focus on finding a second-order stationary point for smooth non-convex optimization by SGD with stochastic heavy ball momentum. Specifically, we consider the stochastic nonconvex optimization problem,  $\min_{w\in \mathbb{R}^d}f(w)\coloneqq \mathbb{E}_{\xi \sim \mathcal{D}}[f(w;\xi)]$ , where we overload the notation so that  $f(w;\xi)$  represents a stochastic function induced by the randomness  $\xi$  while  $f(w)$  is the expectation of the stochastic functions. An  $(\epsilon ,\epsilon)$ -second-order stationary point  $w$  satisfies

$$
\left\| \nabla f (w) \right\| \leq \epsilon \text {a n d} \nabla^ {2} f (w) \succeq - \epsilon I. \tag {1}
$$

Obtaining a second order guarantee has emerged as a desired goal in the nonconvex optimization community. Since finding a global minimum or even a local minimum in general nonconvex optimization can be NP hard, most of the papers in nonconvex optimization target at reaching an approximate second-order stationary point with additional assumptions like Lipschitzness in the gradients and the Hessian (e.g. Allen-Zhu & Li (2018); Carmon & Duchi (2018); Curtis et al. (2017); Daneshmand et al. (2018); Du et al. (2017); Fang et al. (2018; 2019); Ge et al. (2015); Jin et al. (2017; 2019); Kohler & Lucchi (2017); Lei et al. (2017); Lee et al. (2019); Levy (2016); Mokhtari et al. (2018); Nesterov & Polyak (2006); Reddi et al. (2018a); Staib et al. (2019); Tripuraneni et al. (2018); Xu et al.  $(2018)^{2}$ ). We follow these related works for the goal and aim at showing the benefit of the use of the momentum in reaching an  $(\epsilon ,\epsilon)$ -second-order stationary point.

We introduce a required condition, akin to a model assumption made in (Daneshmand et al. (2018)), that ensures the dynamic procedure in Algorithm 2 produces updates with suitable correlation with the negative curvature directions of the function  $f$ .

Definition 1. Assume, at some time  $t$ , that the Hessian  $H_{t} = \nabla^{2}f(w_{t})$  has some eigenvalue smaller than  $-\epsilon$  and  $\| \nabla f(w_{t})\| \leq \epsilon$ . Let  $v_{t}$  be the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of  $\nabla^2 f(w_t)$ . The stochastic momentum  $m_{t}$  satisfies Correlated Negative Curvature (CNC) at  $t$  with parameter  $\gamma >0$  if

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \langle m _ {t}, v _ {t} \rangle^ {2} \right] \geq \gamma . \tag {2}
$$

As we will show, the recursive dynamics of SGD with heavy ball momentum helps in amplifying the escape signal  $\gamma$ , which allows it to escape saddle points faster.

**Contribution:** We show that, under CNC assumption and some minor constraints that upper-bound parameter  $\beta$ , if SGD with momentum has properties called Almost Positively Aligned with Gradient (APAG), Almost Positively Correlated with Gradient (APCG), and Gradient Alignment or Curvature Exploitation (GrACE), defined in the later section, then it takes  $T = O((1 - \beta)\log (1 / (1 - \beta)\epsilon)\epsilon^{-10})$  iterations to return an  $(\epsilon ,\epsilon)$  second order stationary point. Alternatively, one can obtain an  $(\epsilon ,\sqrt{\epsilon})$  second order stationary point in  $T = O((1 - \beta)\log (1 / (1 - \beta)\epsilon)\epsilon^{-5})$  iterations. Our theoretical result demonstrates that a larger momentum parameter  $\beta$  can help in escaping saddle points faster. As saddle points are pervasive in the loss landscape of optimization and deep learning (Dauphin et al. (2014); Choromanska et al. (2015)), the result sheds light on explaining why SGD with momentum enables training faster in optimization and deep learning.

Notation: In this paper we use  $\mathbb{E}_t[\cdot ]$  to represent conditional expectation  $\mathbb{E}[\cdot |w_1,w_2,\dots ,w_t]$ , which is about fixing the randomness upto but not including  $t$  and notice that  $w_{t}$  was determined at  $t - 1$ .

# 2 BACKGROUND

# 2.1 A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT.

Let us provide some high-level intuition about the benefit of stochastic momentum with respect to avoiding saddle points. In an iterative update scheme, at some time  $t_0$  the parameters  $w_{t_0}$  can enter a saddle point region, that is a place where Hessian  $\nabla^2 f(w_{t_0})$  has a non-trivial negative eigenvalue, say  $\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}(\nabla^2 f(w_{t_0})) \leq -\epsilon$ , and the gradient  $\nabla f(w_{t_0})$  is small in norm, say  $\| \nabla f(w_{t_0}) \| \leq \epsilon$ . The challenge here is that gradient updates may drift only very slowly away from the saddle point, and may not escape this region; see (Du et al. (2017); Lee et al. (2019)) for additional details. On the other hand, if the iterates were to move in one particular direction, namely along  $v_{t_0}$  the direction of the smallest eigenvector of  $\nabla^2 f(w_{t_0})$ , then a fast escape is guaranteed under certain constraints on the

step size  $\eta$ ; see e.g. (Carmon et al. (2018)). While the negative eigenvector could be computed directly, this 2nd-order method is prohibitively expensive and hence we typically aim to rely on gradient methods. With this in mind, Daneshmand et al. (2018), who study non-momentum SGD, make an assumption akin to our CNC property described above that each stochastic gradient  $g_{t_0}$  is strongly non-orthogonal to  $v_{t_0}$  the direction of large negative curvature. This suffices to drive the updates out of the saddle point region.

In the present paper we study stochastic momentum, and our CNC property requires that the update direction  $m_{t_0}$  is strongly non-orthogonal to  $v_{t_0}$ ; more precisely,  $\mathbb{E}_{t_0}[\langle m_{t_0},v_{t_0}\rangle^2 ]\geq \gamma >0$ . We are able to take advantage of the analysis of (Daneshmand et al. (2018)) to establish that updates begin to escape a saddle point region for similar reasons. Further, this effect is amplified in successive iterations through the momentum update when  $\beta$  is close to 1. Assume that at some  $w_{t_0}$  we have  $m_{t_0}$  which possesses significant correlation with the negative curvature direction  $v_{t_0}$ , then on successive rounds  $m_{t_0 + 1}$  is quite close to  $\beta m_{t_0}$ ,  $m_{t_0 + 2}$  is quite close to  $\beta^2 m_{t_0}$ , and so forth; see Figure 1 for an example. This provides an intuitive perspective on how momentum might help accelerate the escape process. Yet one might ask does this procedure provably contribute to the escape process and, if so, what is the aggregate performance improvement of the momentum? We answer the first question in the affirmative, and we answer the second question essentially by showing that momentum can help speed up saddle-point escape by a multiplicative factor of  $1 - \beta$ . On the negative side, we also show that  $\beta$  is constrained and may not be chosen arbitrarily close to 1.

# 2.2 MOMENTUM HELPS ESCAPE SADDLE POINTS: AN EMPIRICAL VIEW

Let us now establish, empirically, the clear benefit of stochastic momentum on the problem of saddle-point escape. We construct two stochastic optimization tasks, and each exhibits at least one significant saddle point. The two objectives are as follows.

$$
\min  _ {w} f (w) := \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left(\frac {1}{2} w ^ {\top} H w + b _ {i} ^ {\top} w + \| w \| _ {1 0} ^ {1 0}\right), \tag {3}
$$

$$
\min  _ {w} f (w) := \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left(\left(a _ {i} ^ {\top} w\right) ^ {2} - y\right) ^ {2}. \tag {4}
$$

The first (3) of these was considered by (Staib et al. (2019); Reddi et al. (2018a)) and represents a very straightforward non-convex optimization challenge, with an embedded saddle given by the matrix  $H \coloneqq \mathrm{diag}([1, -0.1])$ , and stochastic gaussian perturbations given by  $b_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathrm{diag}([0.1, 0.001]))$ ; the small variance in the second component provides lower noise in the escape direction. Here we have set  $n = 10$ . Observe that the origin is in the neighborhood of saddle points and has objective

(b) Solving objective (4). (phase retrieval)  
Figure 2: Performance of SGD with different values of  $\beta = \{0,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9\}$ ;  $\beta = 0$  corresponds to the standard SGD. Fig. 4a: We plot convergence in function value  $f(\cdot)$  given in (3). Initialization is always set as  $w_0 = 0$ . All the algorithms use the same step size  $\eta = 5 \times 10^{-5}$ . Fig. 4b: We plot convergence in relative distance to the true model  $w^*$ , defined as  $\min(\| w_t - w^* \|, \| w_t + w^* \|) / \| w^* \|$ , which more appropriately captures progress as the global sign of the objective (4) is unrecoverable. All the algorithms are initialized at the same point  $w_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathcal{I}_d / (10000d))$  and use the same step size  $\eta = 5 \times 10^{-4}$ .

value zero. SGD and SGD with momentum are initialized at the origin in the experiment so that they have to escape saddle points before the convergence. The second objective (4) appears in the phase retrieval problem, that has real applications in physical sciences (Candés et al. (2013); Shechtman et al. (2015)). In phase retrieval<sup>3</sup>, one wants to find an unknown  $w^{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$  with access to but a few samples  $y_{i} = (a_{i}^{\top}w^{*})^{2}$ ; the design vector  $a_{i}$  is known a priori. Here we have sampled  $w^{*} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathcal{I}_{d} / d)$  and  $a_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathcal{I}_{d})$  with  $d = 10$  and  $n = 200$ .

The empirical findings, displayed in Figure 2, are quite stark: for both objectives, convergence is significantly accelerated by larger choices of  $\beta$ . In the first objective (Figure 4a), we see each optimization trajectory entering a saddle point region, apparent from the "flat" progress, yet we observe that large-momentum trajectories escape the saddle much more quickly than those with smaller momentum. A similar affect appears in Figure 4b. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported empirical finding that establishes the dramatic speed up of stochastic momentum for finding an optimal solution in phase retrieval.

# 2.3 RELATED WORKS.

Heavy ball method: The heavy ball method was originally proposed by Polyak (1964). It has been observed that this algorithm, even in the deterministic setting, provides no convergence speedup over standard gradient descent, except in some highly structure cases such as convex quadratic objectives where an "accelerated" rate is possible (Lessard et al. (2016); Goh (2017); Ghadimi et al. (2015); Sun et al. (2019); Loizou & Richtárik (2017); Gadat et al. (2016); Yang et al. (2018); Kidambi et al. (2018); Can et al. (2019)). We provide a comprehensive survey of the related works about heavy ball method in Appendix A.

Reaching a second order stationary point: As we mentioned earlier, there are many works aim at reaching a second order stationary point. We classify them into two categories: specialized algorithms and simple GD/SGD variants. Specialized algorithms are those designed to exploit the negative curvature explicitly and escape saddle points faster than the ones without the explicit exploitation (e.g. Carmon et al. (2018); Agarwal et al. (2017); Allen-Zhu & Li (2018); Xu et al. (2018)). Simple GD/SGD variants are those with minimal tweaks of standard GD/SGD or their variants (e.g. Ge et al. (2015); Levy (2016); Fang et al. (2019); Jin et al. (2017; 2018; 2019); Daneshmand et al. (2018); Staib et al. (2019)). Our work belongs to this category. In this category, perhaps the pioneer works are (Ge et al. (2015)) and (Jin et al. (2017)). Jin et al. (2017) show that explicitly adding isotropic noise in each iteration guarantees that GD escapes saddle points and finds a second order stationary

point with high probability. Following (Jin et al. (2017)), Daneshmand et al. (2018) assume that stochastic gradient inherently has a component to escape. Specifically, they make assumption of the Correlated Negative Curvature (CNC) for stochastic gradient  $g_{t}$  so that  $\mathbb{E}_t[\langle g_t,v_t\rangle^2 ]\geq \gamma >0$ . The assumption allows the algorithm to avoid the procedure of perturbing the updates by adding isotropic noise. Our work is motivated by (Daneshmand et al. (2018)) but assumes CNC for the stochastic momentum  $m_{t}$  instead. In Appendix A, we compare the results of our work with the related works.

# 3 MAIN RESULTS

We assume that the gradient  $\nabla f$  is  $L$ -Lipschitz; that is,  $f$  is  $L$ -smooth. Further, we assume that the Hessian  $\nabla^2 f$  is  $\rho$ -Lipschitz. These two properties ensure that  $\| \nabla f(w) - \nabla f(w') \| \leq L \| w - w' \|$  and that  $\| \nabla^2 f(w) - \nabla^2 f(w') \| \leq \rho \| w - w' \|$ ,  $\forall w, w'$ . The  $L$ -Lipschitz gradient assumption implies that  $|f(w') - f(w) - \langle \nabla f(w), w' - w \rangle| \leq \frac{L}{2} \| w - w' \|^2$ ,  $\forall w, w'$ , while the  $\rho$ -Lipschitz Hessian assumption implies that  $|f(w') - f(w) - \langle \nabla f(w), w' - w \rangle - (w' - w)^{\top} \nabla^2 f(w)(w' - w)| \leq \frac{\rho}{6} \| w - w' \|^3$ ,  $\forall w, w'$ . Furthermore, we assume that the stochastic gradient has bounded noise  $\| \nabla f(w) - \nabla f(w; \xi) \|^2 \leq \sigma^2$  and that the norm of stochastic momentum is bounded so that  $\| m_t \| \leq c_m$ . We denote  $\Pi_i M_i$  as the matrix product of matrices  $\{M_i\}$  and we use  $\sigma_{max}(M) = \| M \|_2 := \sup_{x \neq 0} \frac{\langle x, Mx \rangle}{\langle x, x \rangle}$  to denote the spectral norm of the matrix  $M$ .

# 3.1 REQUIRED PROPERTIES WITH EMPIRICAL VALIDATION

Our analysis of stochastic momentum relies on three properties of the stochastic momentum dynamic. These properties are somewhat unusual, but we argue they should hold in natural settings, and later we aim to demonstrate that they hold empirically in a couple of standard problems of interest.

Definition 2. We say that SGD with stochastic momentum satisfies Almost Positively Aligned with Gradient (APAG) if we have

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \left\langle \nabla f \left(w _ {t}\right), m _ {t} - g _ {t} \right\rangle \right] \geq - \frac {1}{2} \| \nabla f \left(w _ {t}\right) \| ^ {2}. \tag {5}
$$

We say that SGD with stochastic momentum satisfies Almost Positively Correlated with Gradient (APCG) with parameter  $\tau$  if  $\exists c' > 0$  such that,

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \left\langle \nabla f (w _ {t}), M _ {t} m _ {t} \right\rangle \right] \geq - c ^ {\prime} \eta \sigma_ {\max } \left(M _ {t}\right) \| \nabla f (w _ {t}) \| ^ {2}, \tag {6}
$$

where the PSD matrix  $M_{t}$  is defined as

$$
M _ {t} = (\Pi_ {s = 1} ^ {\tau - 1} G _ {s, t}) (\Pi_ {s = k} ^ {\tau - 1} G _ {s, t}) \quad w i t h \quad G _ {s, t} := I - \eta \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {s} \beta^ {s - k} \nabla^ {2} f (w _ {t})
$$

for any integer  $1 \leq k \leq \tau - 1$ , and  $\eta$  is any step size chosen that guarantees each  $G_{s,t}$  is PSD.

Definition 3. We say that the SGD with momentum exhibits Gradient Alignment or Curvature Exploitation (GrACE) if  $\exists c_h \geq 0$  such that

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t} \left[ \eta \langle \nabla f (w _ {t}), g _ {t} - m _ {t} \rangle + \frac {\eta^ {2}}{2} m _ {t} ^ {\top} \nabla^ {2} f (w _ {t}) m _ {t} \right] \leq \eta^ {2} c _ {h}. \tag {7}
$$

APAG requires that the momentum term  $m_t$  must, in expectation, not be significantly misaligned with the gradient  $\nabla f(w_t)$ . This is a very natural condition when one sees that the momentum term is acting as a biased estimate of the gradient of the deterministic  $f$ . APAG demands that the bias can not be too large relative to the size of  $\nabla f(w_t)$ . Indeed this property is only needed in our analysis when the gradient is large (i.e.  $\| \nabla f(w_t) \| \geq \epsilon$ ) as it guarantees that the algorithm makes progress; our analysis does not require APAG holds when gradient is small.

APCG is a related property, but requires that the current momentum term  $m_{t}$  is almost positively correlated with the gradient  $\nabla f(w_{t})$ , but measured in the Mahalanobis norm induced by  $M_{t}$ . It may appear to be an unusual object, but one can view the PSD matrix  $M_{t}$  as measuring something about the local curvature of the function with respect to the trajectory of the SGD with momentum dynamic. We will show that this property holds empirically on two natural problems for a reasonable constant  $c'$ . APCG is only needed in our analysis when the update is in a saddle region with significant

Note that the function value/relative distance to  $w^{*}$  are plotted on Figure 2. Above, sub-figures (a) and (d): We plot the gradient norms versus iterations. Sub-figures (b) and (e): We plot the values of  $\langle \nabla f(w_{t}), m_{t} - g_{t} \rangle / \| \nabla f(w_{t}) \|^{2}$  versus iterations. For (b), we only report them when the gradient is large  $(\| \nabla f(w_{t}) \| \geq 0.02)$ . It shows that the value is large than  $-0.5$  except the transition. For (e), we observe that the value is almost always nonnegative. Sub-figures (c) and (f): We plot the value of  $\langle \nabla f(w_{t}), M_{t}m_{t} \rangle / \eta \sigma_{max}(M_{t}) \| \nabla f(w_{t}) \|^{2}$ . For (c), we let  $M_{t} = (\Pi_{s=1}^{3 \times 10^{5}} G_{s,t})(\Pi_{s=1}^{3 \times 10^{5}} G_{s,t})$  and we only report the values when the update is in the region of saddle points. For (f), we let  $M_{t} = (\Pi_{s=1}^{500} G_{s,t})(\Pi_{s=1}^{500} G_{s,t})$  and we observe that the value is almost always nonnegative. The figures imply that SGD with momentum has APAG and APCG properties in the experiments. Furthermore, an interesting observation is that, for the phase retrieval problem, the expected values might actually be nonnegative.

negative curvature,  $\| \nabla f(w) \| \leq \epsilon$  and  $\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}(\nabla^2 f(w)) \leq -\epsilon$ . Our analysis does not require APCG holds when the gradient is large or the update is at an  $(\epsilon, \epsilon)$ -second order stationary point.

For GrACE, the first term on l.h.s of (7) measures the alignment between stochastic momentum  $m_{t}$  and the gradient  $\nabla f(w_{t})$ , while the second term on l.h.s measures the curvature exploitation. The first term is small (or even negative) when the stochastic momentum  $m_{t}$  is aligned with the gradient  $\nabla f(w_{t})$ , while the second term is small (or even negative) when the stochastic momentum  $m_{t}$  can exploit a negative curvature (i.e. the subspace of eigenvectors that corresponds to the negative eigenvalues of the Hessian  $\nabla^2 f(w_t)$  if exists). Overall, a small sum of the two terms (and, consequently, a small  $c_{h}$ ) allows one to bound the function value of the next iterate (see Lemma 8).

On Figure 3, we report some quantities related to APAG and APCG as well as the gradient norm when solving the previously discussed problems (3) and (4) using SGD with momentum. We also report a quantity regarding GrACE on Figure 4 in the appendix.

# 3.2 CONVERGENCE RESULTS

The high level idea of our analysis follows as a similar template to (Jin et al. (2017); Daneshmand et al. (2018); Staib et al. (2019)). Our proof is structured into three cases: either (a)  $\| \nabla f(w)\| \geq \epsilon$ , or (b)  $\| \nabla f(w)\| \leq \epsilon$  and  $\lambda_{\min}(\nabla^2 f(w)) \leq -\epsilon$ , or otherwise (c)  $\| \nabla f(w)\| \leq \epsilon$  and  $\lambda_{\min}(\nabla^2 f(w)) \geq -\epsilon$ , meaning we have arrived in a second-order stationary region. The precise algorithm we analyze is Algorithm 2, which identical to Algorithm 1 except that we boost the step size to a larger value  $r$  on

occasion. We will show that the algorithm makes progress in cases (a) and (b). In case (c), when the goal has already been met, further execution of the algorithm only weakly hurts progress. Ultimately, we prove that a second order stationary point is arrived at with high probability. While our proof borrows tools from (Daneshmand et al. (2018); Staib et al. (2019)), much of the momentum analysis is entirely novel to our knowledge.

Theorem 1. Assume that the stochastic momentum satisfies CNC. Set  $r = O(\epsilon^2)$ ,  $\eta = O(\epsilon^5)$ , and  $\mathcal{T}_{thred} = O((1 - \beta)\log (\frac{1}{(1 - \beta)\epsilon})\epsilon^{-6})$ . If SGD with momentum (Algorithm 2) has APAG property when gradient is large  $(\| \nabla f(w)\| \geq \epsilon)$ ,  $APCG_{\mathcal{T}_{thred}}$  property when it enters a region of saddle points that exhibits a negative curvature  $(\| \nabla f(w)\| \leq \epsilon$  and  $\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}(\nabla^{2}f(w))\leq -\epsilon)$ , and GrACE property throughout the iterations, then it reaches an  $(\epsilon ,\epsilon)$  second order stationary point in  $T = O((1 - \beta)\log (\frac{Lc_m\sigma^2\rho c'c_h}{(1 - \beta)\delta\gamma\epsilon})\epsilon^{-10})$  iterations with high probability  $1 - \delta$ .

The theorem implies the advantage of using stochastic momentum for SGD. Higher  $\beta$  leads to reaching a second order stationary point faster. As we will show in the following, this is due to that higher  $\beta$  enables escaping the saddle points faster. Below we provide some key details of the proof of Theorem 1. The interested reader can read a high-level sketch of the proof, as well as the detailed version, in Appendix G.

# 3.2.1 ESCAPING SADDLE POINTS

In this subsection, we analyze the process of escaping saddle points by SGD with momentum. Denote  $t_0$  any time such that  $(t_0 \mod \mathcal{T}_{\text{thred}}) = 0$ . Suppose that it enters the region exhibiting a small gradient but a large negative eigenvalue of the Hessian (i.e.  $\| \nabla f(w_{t_0}) \| \leq \epsilon$  and  $\lambda_{\min}(\nabla^2 f(w_{t_0})) \leq -\epsilon$ ). We want to show that it takes at most  $\mathcal{T}_{\text{thred}}$  iterations to escape the region and whenever it escapes, the function value decreases at least by  $\mathcal{F}_{\text{thred}} = O(\epsilon^4)$  on expectation, where the precise expression of  $\mathcal{F}_{\text{thred}}$  will be determined later in Appendix E. The technique that we use is proving by contradiction. Assume that the function value on expectation does not decrease at least  $\mathcal{F}_{\text{thred}}$  in  $\mathcal{T}_{\text{thred}}$  iterations. Then, we get an upper bound of the expected distance  $\mathbb{E}_{t_0}[\| w_{t_0 + \mathcal{T}_{\text{thred}}} - w_{t_0} \|^2] \leq C_{\text{upper}}$ . Yet, by leveraging the negative curvature, we also show a lower bound of the form  $\mathbb{E}_{t_0}[\| w_{t_0 + \mathcal{T}_{\text{thred}}} - w_{t_0} \|^2] \geq C_{\text{lower}}$ . The analysis will show that the lower bound is larger than the upper bound (namely,  $C_{\text{lower}} > C_{\text{upper}}$ ), which leads to the contradiction and concludes that the function value must decrease at least  $\mathcal{F}_{\text{thred}}$  in  $\mathcal{T}_{\text{thred}}$  iterations on expectation. Since  $\mathcal{T}_{\text{thred}} = O((1 - \beta) \log (\frac{1}{(1 - \beta)\epsilon}) \epsilon^6)$ , the dependency on  $\beta$  suggests that larger  $\beta$  can leads to smaller  $\mathcal{T}_{\text{thred}}$ , which implies that larger momentum helps in escaping saddle points faster.

Lemma 1 below provides an upper bound of the expected distance. The proof is in Appendix C.

Lemma 1. Denote  $t_0$  any time such that  $(t_0 \mod \mathcal{T}_{thred}) = 0$ . Suppose that  $\mathbb{E}_{t_0}[f(w_{t_0}) - f(w_{t_0 + t})] \leq \mathcal{F}_{thred}$  for any  $0 \leq t \leq \mathcal{T}_{thred}$ . Then,  $\mathbb{E}_{t_0}[\| w_{t_0 + t} - w_{t_0}\|^2] \leq C_{upper,t} := \frac{8\eta t(\mathcal{F}_{thred} + 2r^2c_h + \frac{\rho}{3}r^3c_m^3)}{(1 - \beta)^2} + 8\eta^2\frac{t\sigma^2}{(1 - \beta)^2} + 4\eta^2\left(\frac{\beta}{1 - \beta}\right)^2c_m^2 + 2r^2c_m^2$ .

We see that  $C_{\mathrm{upper},t}$  in Lemma 1 is monotone increasing with  $t$ , so we can define  $C_{\mathrm{upper}} \coloneqq C_{\mathrm{upper},\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{thred}}}$ . Now let us switch to obtaining the lower bound of  $\mathbb{E}_{t_0}\left[\| w_{t_0} + \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{thred}} - w_{t_0}\|^2\right]$ . The key to get the lower bound comes from the recursive dynamics of SGD with momentum.

Lemma 2. Denote  $t_0$  any time such that  $(t_0 \mod \mathcal{T}_{\text{thred}}) = 0$ . Let us define a quadratic approximation at  $w_{t_0}$ ,  $Q(w) := f(w_{t_0}) + \langle w - w_{t_0}, \nabla f(w_{t_0}) \rangle + \frac{1}{2} (w - w_{t_0})^\top H (w - w_{t_0})$ , where  $H := \nabla^2 f(w_{t_0})$ . Also, define  $G_s := (I - \eta \sum_{k=1}^{s} \beta^{s-k} H)$ . Then we can write  $w_{t_0+t} - w_{t_0}$  exactly using the following decomposition.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \overbrace {\left(\Pi_ {j = 1} ^ {t - 1} G _ {j}\right) \left(- r m _ {t _ {0}}\right)} ^ {q _ {v, t - 1}} + \eta (- 1) \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {t - 1} \left(\Pi_ {j = s + 1} ^ {t - 1} G _ {j}\right) \beta^ {s} m _ {t _ {0}} \\ + \quad \eta (- 1) \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {t - 1} \left(\Pi_ {j = s + 1} ^ {t - 1} G _ {j}\right) \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {s} \beta^ {s - k} \left(\nabla f \left(w _ {t _ {0} + k}\right) - \nabla Q \left(w _ {t _ {0} + s}\right)\right) \\ + \quad \eta (- 1) \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {t - 1} \left(\Pi_ {j = s + 1} ^ {t - 1} G _ {j}\right) \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {s} \beta^ {s - k} \nabla f \left(w _ {t _ {0}}\right) + \eta (- 1) \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {t - 1} \left(\Pi_ {j = s + 1} ^ {t - 1} G _ {j}\right) \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {s} \beta^ {s - k} \xi_ {t _ {0} + k}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The proof of Lemma 2 is in Appendix D. Furthermore, we will use the quantities  $q_{v,t-1}, q_{m,t-1}, q_{q,t-1}, q_{w,t-1}, q_{\xi,t-1}$  as defined above throughout the analysis.

Lemma 3. Following the notations of Lemma 2, we have that

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} \left[ \left\| w _ {t _ {0} + t} - w _ {t _ {0}} \right\| ^ {2} \right] \geq \mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} \left[ \left\| q _ {v, t - 1} \right\| ^ {2} \right] + 2 \eta \mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} \left[ \left\langle q _ {v, t - 1}, q _ {m, t - 1} + q _ {q, t - 1} + q _ {w, t - 1} + q _ {\xi , t - 1} \right\rangle \right] =: C _ {l o w e r}.
$$

We are going to show that the dominant term in the lower bound of  $\mathbb{E}_{t_0}[\| w_{t_0 + t} - w_{t_0}\|^2]$  is  $\mathbb{E}_{t_0}[\| q_{v,t - 1}\|^2]$ , which is the critical component for ensuring that the lower bound is larger than the upper bound of the expected distance.

Lemma 4. Denote  $\theta_{j} := \sum_{k=1}^{j} \beta^{j-k} = \sum_{k=1}^{j} \beta^{k-1}$  and  $\lambda := -\lambda_{\min}(H)$ . Following the conditions and notations in Lemma I and Lemma 2, we have that

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} \left[ \| q _ {v, t - 1} \| ^ {2} \right] \geq \left(\Pi_ {j = 1} ^ {t - 1} (1 + \eta \theta_ {j} \lambda)\right) ^ {2} r ^ {2} \gamma . \tag {8}
$$

Proof. We know that  $\lambda_{\min}(H) \leq -\epsilon < 0$ . Let  $v$  be the eigenvector of the Hessian  $H$  with unit norm that corresponds to  $\lambda_{\min}(H)$  so that  $Hv = \lambda_{\min}(H)v$ . We have  $(I - \eta H)v = v - \eta \lambda_{\min}(H)v = (1 - \eta \lambda_{\min}(H))v$ . Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} [ \| q _ {v, t - 1} \| ^ {2} ] \stackrel {(a)} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} [ \| q _ {v, t - 1} \| ^ {2} \| v \| ^ {2} ] \stackrel {(b)} {\geq} \mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} [ \langle q _ {v, t - 1}, v \rangle^ {2} ] \stackrel {(c)} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} [ \langle (\Pi_ {j = 1} ^ {t - 1} G _ {j}) r m _ {t _ {0}}, v \rangle^ {2} ] \\ \stackrel {(d)} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} [ \langle (\Pi_ {j = 1} ^ {t - 1} (I - \eta \theta_ {j} H)) r m _ {t _ {0}}, v \rangle^ {2} ] = \mathbb {E} _ {t _ {0}} \langle (\Pi_ {j = 1} ^ {t - 1} (1 - \eta \theta_ {j} \lambda_ {\min } (H))) r m _ {t _ {0}}, v \rangle^ {2} ] \tag {9} \\ \stackrel {(e)} {\geq} \left(\Pi_ {j = 1} ^ {t - 1} (1 + \eta \theta_ {j} \lambda)\right) ^ {2} r ^ {2} \gamma , \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $(a)$  is because  $v$  is with unit norm,  $(b)$  is by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,  $(c), (d)$  are by the definitions, and  $(e)$  is by the CNC assumption so that  $\mathbb{E}_{t_0}[\langle m_{t_0}, v \rangle^2] \geq \gamma$ .

Observe that the lower bound in (8) is monotone increasing with  $t$  and the momentum parameter  $\beta$ . Moreover, it actually grows exponentially in  $t$ . To get the contradiction, we have to show that the lower bound is larger than the upper bound. By Lemma 1 and Lemma 3, it suffices to prove the following lemma. We provide its proof in Appendix E.

Lemma 5. Let  $\mathcal{F}_{thred} = O(\epsilon^4)$  and  $\eta^2\mathcal{T}_{thred}\leq r^2$ . By following the conditions and notations in Theorem 1, Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we conclude that if SGD with momentum (Algorithm 2) has the APCG property, then we have that  $C_{lower}:= \mathbb{E}_{t_0}[\| q_v,\mathcal{T}_{thred - 1}\|^2 ] + 2\eta \mathbb{E}_{t_0}[\langle q_v,\mathcal{T}_{thred - 1},q_m,\mathcal{T}_{thred - 1} + q_{q,\mathcal{T}_{thred - 1}} + q_{w,\mathcal{T}_{thred - 1}} + q_{\xi ,\mathcal{T}_{thred - 1}}\rangle ] > C_{upper}$ .

# 4 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we identify three properties that guarantee SGD with momentum in reaching a second-order stationary point faster by a higher momentum, which justifies the practice of using a large value of momentum parameter  $\beta$ . We show that a greater momentum leads to escaping strict saddle points faster due to that SGD with momentum recursively enlarges the projection to an escape direction. However, how to make sure that SGD with momentum has the three properties is not very clear. It would be interesting to identify conditions that guarantee SGD with momentum to have the properties. Perhaps a good starting point is understanding why the properties hold in phase retrieval. We believe that our results shed light on understanding the recent success of SGD with momentum in non-convex optimization and deep learning.
