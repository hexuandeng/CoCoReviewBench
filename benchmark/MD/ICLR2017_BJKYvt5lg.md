# ABSTRACT

Natural image modeling is a landmark challenge of unsupervised learning. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn a useful latent representation and model global structure well but have difficulty capturing small details. PixelCNN models details very well, but lacks a latent code and is difficult to scale to capturing large structures. We present PixelVAE, a VAE model with an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN. PixelVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, requires very few expensive autoregressive layers compared to PixelCNN, and learns latent codes that are more compressed than a standard VAE while still capturing most non-trivial structure. Finally, we extend our model to a hierarchy of latent variables at different scales. Hierarchical PixelVAE achieves competitive performance on 64x64 ImageNet and generates high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Building high-quality generative models of natural images has been a long standing challenge. Although recent work has made significant progress (Kingma & Welling, 2014; van den Oord et al., 2016a;b), we are still far from generating convincing, high-resolution natural images.

Many recent approaches to this problem are based on an efficient method for performing amortized, approximate inference in continuous stochastic latent variables: the variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) jointly trains a top-down decoder generative neural network with a bottom-up encoder inference network. VAEs for images typically use rigid decoders that model the output pixels as conditionally independent given the latent variables. The resulting model learns a useful latent representation of the data and effectively models global structure in images, but has difficulty capturing small-scale features such as textures and sharp edges due to the conditional independence of the output pixels, which significantly hurts both log-likelihood and quality of generated samples compared to other models.

PixelCNNs (van den Oord et al., 2016a;b) are another state-of-the-art image model. Unlike VAEs, PixelCNNs model image densities autoregressively, pixel-by-pixel. This allows the PixelCNN to capture fine details in images, as features such as edges can be precisely aligned. By leveraging carefully constructed masked convolutions (van den Oord et al., 2016b), PixelCNN can be trained efficiently in parallel on GPUs. Nonetheless, PixelCNN models are still very computationally expensive. Unlike typical convolutional architectures they do not apply downsampling between layers, which means that each layer is computationally expensive and that the depth of a PixelCNN must grow linearly with the size of the images in order for it to capture dependencies between far-away

pixels. PixelCNNs also do not explicitly learn a latent representation of the data, which can be useful for downstream tasks such as semi-supervised learning.

Our contributions are as follows:

- We propose PixelVAE, a latent variable model which combines the largely complementary advantages of VAEs and PixelCNNs by using PixelCNN-based masked convolutions in the conditional output distribution of a VAE.  
- We extend PixelVAE to a hierarchical model with multiple stochastic layers and PixelCNN decoders at each layer. This lets us autoregressively model with PixelCNN not only the output pixels but also higher-level latent featuremaps.  
- On binarized MNIST, we show that PixelVAE: (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance, (2) can perform comparably to PixelCNN using far fewer computationally expensive autoregressive layers, and (3) can store less information in its latent variable than a standard VAE while still accounting for most non-trivial structure.  
- We evaluate hierarchical PixelVAE on 64x64 ImageNet and the LSUN bedrooms dataset. On 64x64 ImageNet, we report competitive log-likelihood. On LSUN bedrooms, we generate high-quality samples and show that PixelVAE learns to model different properties of the scene with each of its multiple layers.

# 2 RELATED WORK

There has been significant recent work on generative models for images, with two major lines of approach, namely variational inference based frameworks and adversarial models. We briefly discuss some of the most prominent members of both families below, especially those that are related to our approach.

The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) is an elegant framework to perform approximate variational inference by using neural networks to model both the approximate posterior (with an isotropic Gaussian prior) as well as the distribution of the data conditioned on the latent representation. Thanks to the reparameterization trick, this reduces to an end-to-end SGD-trainable autoencoder architecture that optimizes a lower bound estimate of the marginal likelihood of the data.

![](images/062e6edff49573b1644db18b2d8dd0e636f61ed72f037b7966d66027f69ee83f.jpg)  
Figure 2: Our proposed model, PixelVAE, makes use of PixelCNN to model an autoregressive decoder for a VAE. VAEs, which assume independence among pixels, are known to suffer from blurry samples, while PixelCNN, modeling the joint distribution, produces sharp samples, but lack a latent representation that might be more useful for downstream tasks. PixelVAE combines the best of both worlds, providing a meaningful latent representation, while producing sharp samples.

The concept of normalizing flows for stochastic gradient variational inference (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) is applied to the VAE in Kingma et al. (2016) to allow a more flexible approximation of the posterior. The autoregressive formulation of the approximate posterior (following MADE (Germain et al., 2015)) allows for modeling nonlinear dependencies between elements of the latent space.

In the same family, the DRAW model (Gregor et al., 2015) uses instead a recurrent network encoder and a recurrent network decoder coupled with an attention mechanism. This makes the generation process sequential, thus allowing the model to improve the quality of the samples over time in an iterative fashion.

The key member of the other line of approach, i.e., the adversarial models, is the Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) which pits a generator network and a discriminator network against each other. The generator tries to generate samples similar to the training data to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to detect if the sample originates from the data distribution or not. GANs are known for providing samples that are qualitatively the best, yet they have some downsides: it is non-trivial to derive a data likelihood (Parzen-window based estimates are usually used to this end) and they exhibit unstable training dynamics. Recent works along this direction have improved the stability in training (Salimans et al., 2016), and scaled up the size of the samples – as well as improved their quality – through the application of CNNs (with upsampling) (Radford et al., 2015).

The idea of using latent representations to capture global dependence while modeling the output space in a decomposed fashion has been explored in the context of sentence modeling in Bowman et al. (2016), that demonstrates the effectiveness of a stochastic latent layer to capture global semantics while modeling local structure with RNNs for generating sentences.

# 3 PIxELVAE MODEL

Like a VAE, our model jointly trains an "encoder" inference network, which maps an image  $x$  to a posterior distribution over latent variables  $z$ , and a "decoder" generative network, which models a distribution over  $x$  conditioned on  $z$ . The encoder and decoder networks are composed of a series of convolutional layers, respectively with strided convolutions for downsampling in the encoder and transposed convolutions for upsampling in the decoder.

As opposed to most VAE decoders model each dimension of the output independently (for example, by modeling the output as a Gaussian with diagonal covariance), we use a conditional PixelCNN in

the decoder. Our decoder models  $x$  as the product of each dimension  $x_{i}$  conditioned on all previous dimensions and the latent variable  $z$ :

$$
p (x | z) = \prod_ {i} p \left(x _ {i} \mid x _ {1}, \dots , x _ {i 1}, z\right) \tag {1}
$$

We first transform  $z$  through a series of convolutional layers into featuremaps with the same spatial resolution as the output image and then concatenate the resulting featuremaps with the image. The resulting concatenated featuremaps are then further processed by several PixelCNN masked convolutional layers and a final PixelCNN 256-way softmax output.

Unlike typical PixelCNN implementations, we use very few PixelCNN layers in our decoder, relying on the latent variables to model the structure of the input at scales larger than the combined receptive field of our PixelCNN layers. As a result of this, our architecture captures global structure at a much lower computational cost than a standard PixelCNN implementation.

# 3.1 HIERARCHICAL ARCHITECTURE

The performance of VAEs can be improved by stacking them to form a hierarchy of stochastic latent variables: in the simplest configuration, the VAE at each level models a distribution over the latent variables at the next level downward, with generation proceeding downward and inference upward through each level. In convolutional architectures, the intermediate latent variables are typically organized into featuremaps whose spatial resolution decreases toward higher levels.

Our model can be extended in the same way. When we do this, at each level, the generator is a conditional PixelCNN over the latent features in the next level downward. This lets us autoregressively model with PixelCNN not only the output distribution over pixels but also the prior over each set of latent featuremaps. The higher-level PixelCNN decoders use diagonal Gaussian output layers instead of 256-way softmax, and model the dimensions within each spatial location independently (this is done for simplicity, but is not a limitation of our model).

For a model with L levels of latent variables, we train this model by minimizing the negative of the evidence lower bound:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - L \left(x, \theta_ {0}, \dots , \theta_ {L}, \phi_ {0}, \dots , \phi_ {L}\right) = - \log p _ {\theta_ {0}} (x | z _ {1}) + D _ {K L} \left(q _ {\phi_ {0}} \left(z _ {1} | x\right) | | p _ {\theta_ {1}} \left(z _ {1} | z _ {2}\right)\right) \\ + \sum_ {l = 2} ^ {L} D _ {K L} \left(q _ {\phi_ {l - 1}} \left(z _ {l} \mid z _ {l - 1}\right) \mid \mid p _ {\theta_ {l}} \left(z _ {l}\right)\right) \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\theta$  are the decoder parameters and  $\phi$  are the encoder parameters.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

# 4.1 MNIST

We evaluate our model on the binarized MNIST dataset (Salakhutdinov & Murray, 2008; Lecun et al., 1998) and report results in Table 1. We also experiment with a variant of our model in which each PixelCNN layer is directly conditioned on a linear transformation of latent variable,  $z$  (rather than transforming  $z$  first through several upsampling convolutional layers) (as in van den Oord et al. (2016b) and find that this further improves performance, achieving an NLL upper bound comparable with the current state of the art. We estimate the marginal NLL of our model (using 1000 importance samples per datapoint) and find it achieves state of the art performance.

# 4.1.1 NUMBER OF PILXELCNN LAYERS

"Gated PixelCNN" and "Gated PixelVAE" use the gated activation function in van den Oord et al. (2016b). In "Gated PixelVAE without upsampling", a linear transformation of latent variable conditions the (gated) activation in every PixelCNN layer instead of using upsampling layers.

typically needs a large number of them. One advantage of our architecture is that we can achieve strong performance with very few PixelCNN layers, which makes training and sampling from our model significantly faster than PixelCNN. To demonstrate this, we compare the performance of our model to PixelCNN as a function of the number of PixelCNN layers (figure 3). We find that with fewer than 10 autoregressive layers, our PixelVAE model performs much better than PixelCNN. This is expected since long-range dependencies

We can see that adding a single PixelCNN layer has a dramatic impact on the NLL bound of PixelVAE. This is what we expect since the additional PixelCNN layer helps model local characteristics which are complementary to the global characteristics which a VAE with a factorized output distribution models.

In our MNIST experiments, we have used PixelCNN layers with no blind spots using vertical and horizontal stacks as proposed in van den Oord et al. (2016b).

# 4.1.2 LATENT VARIABLE INFORMATION CONTENT

Because the autoregressive conditional likelihood function of PixelVAE is expressive enough to model some properties of the image distribution, it isn't forced to account for those properties

![](images/825b827e79c31639792f9f72fe42f2c0da4cb3bd1751b0a365495f2b80dcabdf.jpg)  
Figure 4: NLL break down into KL divergence and reconstruction cost.

through its latent variables as a standard VAE is. As a result, we can expect PixelVAE to learn latent representations which are invariant to textures, precise positions, and other attributes which are more efficiently modeled by the autoregressive decoder. To empirically validate this, we train PixelVAE models with different numbers of autoregressive layers (and hence, different PixelCNN receptive field sizes) and plot the breakdown of the NLL bound for each of these models into the reconstruction term  $\log p(x|z)$  and the KL divergence term  $D_{KL}(q(z|x)||p(z))$  (Figure 4). The KL divergence term can be interpreted as a measure of the information content in the posterior distribution  $q(z|x)$  and hence, models with smaller KL terms encode less information in their latent variables.

We observe a sharp drop in the KL divergence term when we use a single autoregressive layer compared to no autoregressive layers, indicating that the latent variables have been freed from having to encode small-scale details in the images. Since the addition of a single PixelCNN layer allows the decoder to model interactions between pixels which are at most 2 pixels away from each other (since our masked convolution filter size is  $5 \times 5$ ), we can also say that most of the non-trivial (long-range) structure in the images is still encoded in the latent variables.

# 4.2 LSUN BEDROOMS

To evaluate our model's performance with more data and complicated image distributions, we perform experiments on the LSUN bedrooms dataset (Yu et al., 2015). We use the same preprocessing as in Radford et al. (2015) to remove duplicate images in the dataset. For quantitative experiments we use a  $32 \times 32$  downsampled version of the dataset, and we present samples from a model trained on the  $64 \times 64$  version.

We train a two-level PixelVAE with latent variables at 1x1 and 8x8 spatial resolutions. We find that this outperforms both a two-level convolutional VAE with diagonal Gaussian output and a single-level PixelVAE in terms of log-likelihood and sample quality. We also try replacing the PixelCNN layers in the higher level with a diagonal Gaussian decoder and find that this hurts log-likelihood, which suggests that multi-scale PixelVAE uses those layers effectively to autoregressively model latent features.

# 4.2.1 FEATURES MODELED AT EACH LAYER

To see which features are modeled by each of the multiple layers, we draw multiple samples while varying the sampling noise at only a specific layer (either the pixel-wise output of one of the la

tent layers) and visually inspect the resulting images (Figure 5). When we vary only the pixel-level sampling (holding  $z_{1}$  and  $z_{2}$  fixed), samples are almost indistinguishable and differ only in precise positioning and shading details, suggesting that the model uses the pixel-level autoregressive distribution to model only these features. Samples where only the noise in the middle-level  $(8 \times 8)$  latent variables is varied have different objects and colors, but appear to have similar basic room geometry and composition. Finally, samples with varied top-level latent variables have diverse room geometry.

It appears that the top-level latent variables learn to model room structure and overall geometry, the middle-level latents model color and texture features, and the pixel-level distribution models low-level image characteristics such as texture, alignment, shading.

# 4.3 64x64 IMAGENET

The 64x64 ImageNet generative modeling task was introduced in (van den Oord et al., 2016a) and involves density estimation of a difficult, highly varied image distribution. We trained a hierarchical PixelVAE model (with a similar architecture to the model in section 4.2) of comparable size to the models in van den Oord et al. (2016a;b) on 64x64 ImageNet in 5 days on 3 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs. We report validation set likelihood in table 2. Our model achieves a slightly lower log-likelihood than PixelRNN (van den Oord et al., 2016a), but a visual inspection of ImageNet samples from our model 6 reveals them to be significantly more globally coherent.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we introduced a VAE model for natural images with an autoregressive decoder that achieves strong performance across a number of datasets. We explored properties of our model, showing that it can generate more compressed latent representations than a standard VAE and that it can use fewer autoregressive layers than PixelCNN. We established a new state-of-the-art on binarized MNIST dataset in terms of likelihood on 64x64 ImageNet and demonstrated that our model generates high-quality samples on LSUN bedrooms.

The ability of PixelVAE to learn compressed representations in its latent variables by ignoring the small-scale structure in images is potentially very useful for downstream tasks. It would be interesting to further explore our model's capabilities for semi-supervised classification and representation learning in future work.
