# ABSTRACT

We develop new approximation and statistical learning theories of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via the ResNet-type structure where the channel size, width, and filter size are fixed. It is shown that a ResNet-type CNN is a universal approximator and its expression ability is no worse than fully connected neural networks (FNNs) with a block-sparse structure even if the size of each layer in the CNN is fixed. Our result is general in the sense that we can automatically translate any approximation rate achieved by block-sparse FNNs into that by CNNs. Thanks to the general theory, it is shown that learning on CNNs satisfies optimality in approximation and estimation of several important function classes.

As applications, we consider two types of function classes to be estimated: the Barron class and the Hölder class. We prove the regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM) estimator can achieve the same rate as FNNs even the channel size, filter size, and width of CNNs are constant with respect to the sample size. This is the minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for the Hölder class. Our proof is based on sophisticated evaluations of the covering number of CNNs and the non-trivial parameter rescaling technique to control the Lipschitz constant of CNNs to be constructed.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most popular architectures in deep learning research, with various applications such as computer vision (Krizhevsky et al. (2012)), natural language processing (Wu et al. (2016)), and sequence analysis in bioinformatics (Alipanahi et al. (2015), Zhou & Troyanskaya (2015)). Despite practical popularity, theoretical justification for the power of CNNs is still scarce from the viewpoint of statistical learning theory.

For fully-connected neural networks (FNNs), there is a lot of existing work, dating back to the 80's, for theoretical explanation regarding their approximation ability (Cybenko (1989), Barron (1993), Lu et al. (2017), Yarotsky (2017), and Petersen & Voigtlaender (2017)) and generalization power (Barron (1994), Arora et al. (2018), and Suzuki (2018)). See also Pinkus (2005) and Kainen et al. (2013) for surveys of earlier works. Although less common compared to FNNs, recently, statistical learning theory for CNNs has been studied, both about approximation ability (Zhou (2018), Yarotsky (2018), Petersen & Voigtlaender (2018)) and about generalization power (Zhou & Feng (2018)). One of the standard approaches is to relate the approximate power of CNNs with that of FNNs, either deep or shallow. For example, Zhou (2018) proved that CNNs are a universal approximator of the Barron class (Barron (1993), Klusowski & Barron (2016)), which is a historically important function class in the approximation theory. Their approach is to approximate the function using a 3-layered FNN (i.e., an FNN with a single hidden layer) with the ReLU activation function (Krizhevsky et al. (2012)) and transform the FNN into a CNN. Very recently independent of ours, Petersen & Voigtlaender (2018) showed any function realizable with an FNN can extend to an equivariant function realizable by a CNN that has the same order of parameters. However, to the best of our knowledge, no CNNs that achieves the minimax optimal rate in important function classes, including the Hölder class, can keep the number of units in each layer constant with respect

to the sample size. Considering that architectures that have extremely large depth, while moderate channel size and width have become feasible, thanks to recent methods such as identity mappings (He et al. (2016), Huang et al. (2018)), sophisticated initialization schemes (He et al. (2015), Chen et al. (2018)), and normalization techniques (Ioffe & Szegedy (2015), Miyato et al. (2018)). we would argue that there are growing demands for theories which can accommodate such constant-size architectures.

In this paper, we analyze the learning ability of ResNet-type ReLU CNNs which have identity mappings and constant-width residual blocks with fixed-size filters. There are mainly two reasons that motivate us to study this type of CNNs. First, although ResNet is the de facto architecture in various practical applications, the approximation theory for ResNet has not been explored extensively, especially from the viewpoint of the relationship between FNNs and CNNs. Second, constant-width CNNs are critical building blocks not only in ResNet but also in various modern CNNs such as Inception (Szegedy et al. (2015)), DenseNet (Huang et al. (2017)), and U-Net (Ronneberger et al. (2015)), to name a few. Our strategy is to replicate the learning ability of FNNs by constructing tailored ResNet-type CNNs. To do so, we pay attention to the block-sparse structure of an FNN, which roughly means that it consists of a linear combination of multiple (possibly dense) FNNs (we define rigorously in the subsequent sections). Block-sparseness decreases the model complexity coming from the combinatorial sparsity patterns and promotes better bounds. Therefore, it is often utilized, both implicitly or explicitly, in the approximation and learning theory of FNNs (e.g., Bölskei et al. (2017), Yarotsky (2018)). We first prove that if an FNN is block-sparse, then we can realize the FNN with a ResNet-type CNN with  $O(M)$  additional parameters, which are often negligible since the original FNN already has  $\Omega(M)$  parameters in typical settings. Using this approximation, we give the upper bound of the estimation error of CNNs in terms of the approximation errors of block sparse FNNs and the model complexity of CNNs. Our result is general in the sense that it is not restricted to a specific function class, as long as we can approximate it using block-sparse FNNs.

To demonstrate the wide applicability of our methods, we derive the approximation and estimation errors for two types of function classes with the same strategy: Barron class (of parameter  $s = 2$ ) and Hölder class. We prove, as corollaries, that our CNNs can achieve the approximation error of order  $\tilde{O}(M^{-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{D}})$  for the Barron class and  $\tilde{O}(M^{-\frac{\beta}{D}})$  for the  $\beta$ -Hölder class and the estimation error of order  $\tilde{O}_p(N^{-\frac{D + 2}{2(D + 1)}})$  for the Barron class and  $\tilde{O}_p(N^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta + D}})$ , where  $M$  is the number of non-zero parameters and  $N$  is the sample size. These rates are same as the ones for FNNs ever known in the existing literature. An important consequence of our theory is that the ResNet-type CNN can achieve the minimax optimal estimation error (up to logarithmic factors) for  $\beta$ -Hölder class even if it is constant-width, constant-filter-size, and constant-channel-size with respect to the sample size, as opposed to existing works such as Yarotsky (2017) and Petersen & Voigtlaender (2018), where optimal FNNs or CNNs could have a width or a channel size proportional to the sample size.

In summary, the contributions of our work are as follows:

- We develop the approximation theory for CNNs via ResNet-type architectures with constant-width residual blocks. We prove any  $M$ -way block-sparse FNN is realizable such CNN with  $O(M)$  additional parameters. That means if FNNs can approximate a function with  $O(M)$  parameters, we can approximate the function with CNNs at the same rate (Theorem 1).  
- We derive the upper bound of the estimation error in terms of the approximation error of FNNs and the model complexity of CNNs (Corollary 2). This result gives the sufficient conditions on to derive the same estimation error as that of FNNs (Theorem 1).  
- We apply our general theory to the Barron class and Hölder class and derive the approximation (Corollary 2 and 4) and estimation error rates (Corollary 3 and 5), which are identical to those for FNNs, even if the CNNs have constant channel and filter size with respect to the sample size. In particular, this is minimax optimal for the Hölder case.

via FNNs. First and foremost, Zhou (2018) only considered a specific function class — the Barron class — as a target function class, although their method is applicable to any function class that can be realized by a 3-layered ReLU FNN. Regarding the architecture, they considered CNNs with a single channel and whose width is "linearly increasing" (Zhou (2018)) layer by layer. For regression or classification problems, it is rare to use such an architecture. Also, since they did not bound the norm of parameters in the approximating CNNs, we cannot derive the estimation error from this method. Petersen & Voigtlaender (2018) fully utilized the group invariance structure of underlying input space to construct the approximating CNN. Such group structure makes theoretical analysis easier, especially for investigating the equivariance properties of CNNs since it enables us to incorporate mathematical tools such as group theory, Fourier analysis, and representation theory. Although their results are quite strong in that it is applicable to any function that can be approximated by FNNs, their assumption on the group structure excludes the padding convolution layer, an important and popular type of convolution operation. Another point is that if we simply apply their construction method to derive the estimation error for (equivariant) Hölder functions, combined with the approximation result of Yarotsky (2017), the resulting CNN that achieves the minimax optimal rate has  $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{D}{\beta}})$  channels where  $\varepsilon$  is the approximation error threshold. It is partly because their construction is not aware of the internal sparse structure of approximating FNNs. Finally, the filter size of their CNN is as large as the input dimension. As opposed to these two works, we employ padding-type ResNet-type CNNs which have constant width, multiple channels, and fixed-size filters. Like Petersen & Voigtlaender (2018), our result is applicable to any function, as long as the FNNs to be approximated are block sparse, including the Barron and Hölder cases. If we apply our theorem to these classes, we can show that the optimal CNNs can achieve the same approximation and estimation rate as FNNs, while the number of channels is independent of the sample size. Further, this is minimax optimal up to the logarithmic factors for the Hölder class.

Due to its practical success, theoretical analysis for ResNet has been explored recently (e.g., Lin & Jegelka (2018), Lu et al. (2018), Nitanda & Suzuki (2018), and Huang et al. (2018)). From the viewpoint of statistical learning theory, Nitanda & Suzuki (2018) and Huang et al. (2018) investigated the generalization power of ResNet from the perspective of the boosting interpretation. However, they did not discuss the function approximation ability of ResNet. To the best of our knowledge, our theory is the first work to provide the approximation ability of the CNN class that can accommodate the ResNet-type ones.

We import the approximation theories for FNNs, especially ones for the Hölder class and the Barron class. Yarotsky (2017) proved FNNs with  $O(M)$  parameters can approximate  $\beta$ -Hölder continuous functions with the order of  $\tilde{O}(M^{-\frac{\beta}{D}})$ . Using this bound, Schmidt-Hieber (2017) proved that the estimation error of the ERM estimator is  $\tilde{O}(N^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta + D}})$ , which is minimax optimal up to logarithmic

factors (see, e.g., Tsybakov (2008)). The approximation theory for the Barron class has been investigated in e.g., Barron (1993), Klusowski & Barron (2016), and Lee et al. (2017). Originally Barron (1993) considered the case  $s = 1$  and activation functions  $\sigma$  satisfying  $\sigma(z) \to 1$  as  $z \to \infty$  and  $\sigma(z) \to 0$  as  $z \to -\infty$ . Later, Klusowski & Barron (2016) studied the approximation theory with  $s = 2$  and proved that 3-layered ReLU FNNs with  $M$  hidden units can approximate functions of this class with the order of  $\tilde{O}(M^{-\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{D}\right)})$ .

# 3 PROBLEM SETTING

# 3.1 REGULARIZED EMPIRICAL RISK MINIMIZATION

We consider a regression task in this paper. Let  $X$  be a  $[-1,1]^D$ -valued random variable with unknown probability distribution  $\mathcal{P}_X$  and  $\xi$  be an independent random noise drawn from the Gaussian distribution with an unknown variance  $\sigma^2$ :  $\xi \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$  ( $\sigma > 0$ ). Let  $f^\circ$  be an unknown deterministic function  $f^\circ : [-1,1]^D \to \mathbb{R}$  (we will characterize  $f^\circ$  rigorously in the theorems later). We define a random variable  $Y$  by  $Y := f^\circ(X) + \xi$ . We denote the joint distribution of  $(X,Y)$  by  $\mathcal{P}$ . Suppose we are given a dataset  $\mathcal{D} = ((x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_N,y_N))$  independently and identically sampled from the distribution  $\mathcal{P}$ , we want to estimate the true function  $f^\circ$  from the finite dataset  $\mathcal{D}$ .

We evaluate the performance of an estimator by the squared error. For a measurable function  $f:[-1,1]^D\to \mathbb{R}$ , we define the empirical error of  $f$  by  $\hat{\mathcal{R}}_{\mathcal{D}}(f)\coloneqq \sum_{n = 1}^{N}(y_n - f(x_n))^2$  and the estimation error by  $\mathcal{R}(f)\coloneqq \mathbb{E}_{X,Y}\left[(f(X) - Y)^2\right]$ . Given a set  $\mathcal{F}$  consisting of measurable functions from  $[-1,1]^D\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , we consider the regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM) estimator  $\hat{f}$  of  $\mathcal{F}$  that satisfies

$$
\hat {f} := \operatorname {c l i p} [ f _ {\min } ] \quad \text {w h e r e} f _ {\min } \in \underset {f \in \mathcal {F}} {\arg \min } \hat {\mathcal {R}} _ {\mathcal {D}} (\operatorname {c l i p} [ f ]).
$$

Here, clip is the clipping operator defined by  $\mathrm{clip}[f] \coloneqq (f \vee -\| f^{\circ}\|_{\infty}) \wedge \| f^{\circ}\|_{\infty}$ . For a measurable function  $f: [-1,1]^D \to \mathbb{R}$ , we define the  $L_2$ -norm (weighted by  $\mathcal{P}_X$ ) and the sup norm of  $f$  by  $\| f\|_{\mathcal{L}^2(\mathcal{P}_X)} \coloneqq \left(\int_{[-1,1]^D} f^2(x) \mathrm{d}\mathcal{P}_X(x)\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$  and  $\| f\|_{\infty} \coloneqq \sup_{x \in [-1,1]^D} |f(x)|$ , respectively. Let  $\mathcal{L}^2(\mathcal{P}_X)$  be the set of measurable functions  $f$  such that  $\| f\|_{\mathcal{L}^2(\mathcal{P}_X)} < \infty$  with the norm  $\|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{L}^2(\mathcal{P}_X)}$ . The task is to estimate the approximation error  $\min_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \| f - f^{\circ}\|_{\infty}$  and the estimation error of the regularized ERM estimator:  $\mathcal{R}(\hat{f}) - \mathcal{R}(f^{\circ})$ . Note that the estimation error is a random variable with respect to the choice of the training dataset  $\mathcal{D}$ . By the definition of  $\mathcal{R}$  and the independence of  $X$  and  $\xi$ , the estimation error equals to  $\|\hat{f} - f^{\circ}\|_{\mathcal{L}^2(\mathcal{P}_X)}^2$ .

# 3.2 CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS

In this section, we define CNNs used in this paper. For this purpose, it is convenient to introduce  $\ell_0$ , the set of real-valued sequences whose finitely many elements are non-zero:  $\ell_0 := \{w = (w_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mid \exists N \in \mathbb{N}$  s.t.  $w_n = 0, \forall n \geq N\}$ .  $w = (w_1, \ldots, w_K) \in \mathbb{R}^K$  can be regarded as an element of  $\ell_0$  by setting  $w_n = 0$  for all  $n > K$ . Likewise, for  $C, C' \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ , which will be the input and output channel sizes, respectively, we can think of  $(w_{k,j,i})_{k \in [K], j \in [C'], i \in [C]} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times C' \times C}$  as an element of  $\ell_0^{C' \times C}$ . For a filter  $w = (w_{n,j,i})_{n \in \mathbb{N}, i \in [C], j \in [C']} \in \ell_0^{C' \times C}$ , we define the one-sided padding, stride-one convolution by  $w$  as an order-4 tensor  $L_D^w = ((L_D^w)_{\alpha,i}^{\beta,j}) \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D \times C' \times C}$  defined by

$$
(L _ {D} ^ {w}) _ {\alpha , i} ^ {\beta , j} := \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} w _ {(\alpha - \beta), j, i} & \text {i f} 0 \leq \alpha - \beta \leq D - 1 \\ 0 & \text {o t h e r w i s e .} \end{array} \right.
$$

Here,  $i$  (resp.  $j$ ) runs through 1 to  $C$  (resp.  $C'$ ) and  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  runs through 1 to  $D$ . Since we fix the input dimension  $D$  throughout the paper, we will omit the subscript  $D$  and write as  $L^w$  if it is obvious from context for notational simplicity.

Remark 1. For  $K \leq K'$ , we can embed  $\mathbb{R}^K$  into  $\mathbb{R}^{K'}$  by inserting zeros:  $w = (w_1, \ldots, w_K) \mapsto w' = (w_1, \ldots, w_K, 0, \ldots, 0)$ . It is easy to show  $L^w = L^{w'}$ . Using this, we can expand a size- $K$  filter to size- $K'$ .

Figure 1: ResNet-type CNN defined in Definition 1. Variables are as in Definition 1.

We can interpret  $L^w$  as a linear mapping from  $\mathbb{R}^{D \times C}$  to  $\mathbb{R}^{D \times C'}$ . Specifically, for  $x = (x^{\alpha,i})_{\alpha,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times C}$ , we define  $(y^{\beta,j})_{\beta,j} = L_D^w(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times C'}$  by

$$
y ^ {\beta j} := \sum_ {i, \alpha} (L ^ {w}) _ {\alpha , i} ^ {\beta , j} x ^ {\alpha , i}.
$$

Next, we define the building block of CNNs: convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. Let  $C,C^{\prime},K\in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$  be the input channel size, output channel size, and filter size, respectively. For a weight tensor  $w\in \mathbb{R}^{K\times C^{\prime}\times C}$ , a bias vector  $b\in \mathbb{R}^{C^{\prime}}$ , and an activation function  $\sigma :\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ , we define the one-sided padding convolutional layer  $\mathrm{Conv}_{w,b}^{\sigma}:\mathbb{R}^{D\times C}\to \mathbb{R}^{D\times C^{\prime}}$  by  $\mathrm{Conv}_{w,b}^{\sigma}(x)\coloneqq \sigma (L_D^w (x) - \mathbf{1}_D\otimes b)$  where,  $\otimes$  is the outer product of vectors and  $\sigma$  is applied in element-wise manner. Similarly, let  $W\in \mathbb{R}^{D\times C}$ ,  $b\in \mathbb{R}$  and  $\sigma :\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , we define the fully connected layer  $\mathrm{FC}_{W,b}^{\sigma}:\mathbb{R}^{D\times C}\to \mathbb{R}$  by  $\mathrm{FC}_{W,b}^{\sigma}(a) = \sigma (\mathrm{vec}(W)^{\top}\mathrm{vec}(a) - b)$ . Here,  $\mathrm{vec}(\cdot)$  is the vectorization operator that flattens a matrix into a vector.

Finally, we define the ResNet-type CNN. We define it as a sequential concatenation of one convolution block,  $M$  residual blocks, and one fully connected layer. Figure 1 is the schematic view of the CNN we adopt in this paper.

Definition 1. Let  $M \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$  and  $L_{m} \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ , which will be the number of residual blocks and the depth of  $m$ -th block, respectively. Let  $C_m^{(l)}, K_m^{(l)}$  be the channel size and filter size of the  $l$ -th layer of the  $m$ -th block for  $m = 0, \ldots, M^1$  and  $l \in [L_m]$ . We assume  $C_0^{(L_0)} = C_1^{(L_1)} = \dots = C_M^{(L_M)}$ . Let  $w_m^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{K_m^{(l)} \times C_m^{(l)} \times C_m^{(l-1)}}$ ,  $b_m^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}$  be the weight tensors and biases of  $l$ -th layer of the  $m$ -th block in the convolution part, respectively. Finally, let  $W \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times C_0^{(L_0)}}$  and  $b \in \mathbb{R}$  be the weight matrix and the bias for the fully-connected layer part, respectively. For  $\pmb{\theta} := ((w_m^{(l)})_{m,l}, (b_m^{(l)})_{m,l}, W, b)$  and an activation function  $\sigma: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , we define  $\mathrm{CNN}_{\pmb{\theta}}^{\sigma}: \mathbb{R}^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D$ , the CNN constructed from  $\pmb{\theta}$ , by

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {C N N} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} ^ {\sigma} := \operatorname {F C} _ {W, b} ^ {\mathrm {i d}} \circ \left(\operatorname {C o n v} _ {\boldsymbol {w} _ {M}, \boldsymbol {b} _ {M}} ^ {\sigma} + \mathrm {i d}\right) \circ \left(\operatorname {C o n v} _ {\boldsymbol {w} _ {M - 1}, \boldsymbol {b} _ {M - 1}} ^ {\sigma} + \mathrm {i d}\right) \circ \dots \\ \circ (\operatorname {C o n v} _ {\boldsymbol {w} _ {1}, \boldsymbol {b} _ {1}} ^ {\sigma} + \mathrm {i d}) \circ \operatorname {C o n v} _ {\boldsymbol {w} _ {0}, \boldsymbol {b} _ {0}} ^ {\sigma}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathrm{Conv}_{\boldsymbol{w}_m, \boldsymbol{b}_m}^{\sigma} := \mathrm{Conv}_{w_m^{(L_m)}, b_m^{(L_m)}}^{\mathrm{id}} \circ \mathrm{Conv}_{w_m^{(L_m-1)}, b_m^{(L_m-1)}}^{\sigma} \circ \dots \circ \mathrm{Conv}_{w_m^{(1)}, b_m^{(1)}}^{\sigma}$  and  $\mathrm{id}: \mathbb{R}^{D \times C_0^{(L_0)}} \to \mathbb{R}^{D \times C_0^{(L_0)}}$  is the identity function.

Although  $\mathrm{CNN}_{\theta}^{\sigma}$  in this definition has a fully-connected layer, we refer to the stack of convolutional layers both with or without the final fully-connect layer as a CNN in this paper. We say a linear convolutional layer or a linear CNN when the activation function  $\sigma$  is the identity function and a ReLU convolution layer or a ReLU CNN when  $\sigma$  is ReLU. We borrow the term from ResNet and call  $\mathrm{Conv}_{\boldsymbol{w}_m,\boldsymbol{b}_m}^{\sigma}(m > 0)$  and id in the above definition the  $m$ -th residual block and the  $m$ -th identity mapping, respectively. We say a 4-tuple  $\pmb{\theta}$  is compatible with  $(C_m^{(l)})_{m,l}$  and  $(K_m^{(l)})_{m,l}$  when each component of  $\pmb{\theta}$  satisfies the aforementioned dimension conditions.

For architecture parameters  $\pmb{C} = (C_{m}^{(l)})_{m,l}$  and  $\pmb{K} = (K_{m}^{(l)})_{m,l}$  ( $m = 0, \dots, M, l \in [L_{m}]$ ), a sparse parameter  $S \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ , and norm parameters for convolution layers  $B^{(\mathrm{conv})} > 0$  and for fully-

Figure 2: Schematic view of a block-sparse FNN. Variables are as in Definition 2.

connected layers  $B^{(\mathrm{fc})} > 0$ , we define  $\mathcal{F}^{(\mathrm{CNN})} = \mathcal{F}_{\pmb {C},\pmb {K},S,B^{(\mathrm{conv})},B^{(\mathrm{fc})}}^{(\mathrm{CNN})}$ , the hypothesis class consisting of ReLU CNNs, as follows:

$$
\mathcal {F} ^ {\mathrm {(C N N)}} := \left\{\mathrm {C N N} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} ^ {\mathrm {R e L U}} \left| \begin{array}{l} \boldsymbol {\theta} = ((w _ {m} ^ {(l)}) _ {m, l}, (b _ {m} ^ {(l)}) _ {m, l}, W, b) \text {i s c o m p a t i b l e w i t h} (\boldsymbol {C}, \boldsymbol {K}), \\ \sum_ {m = 0} ^ {M} \sum_ {l = 1} ^ {L _ {m}} (\| w _ {m} ^ {(l)} \| _ {0} + \| b _ {m} ^ {(l)} \| _ {0}) + \| W \| _ {0} + \| b \| _ {0} \leq S, \\ \max  _ {m = 0, \ldots , M, l \in [ L _ {m} ]} \| w _ {m} ^ {(l)} \| _ {\infty} \vee \| b _ {m} ^ {(l)} \| _ {\infty} \leq B ^ {\mathrm {(c o n v)}}, \\ \| W \| _ {\infty} \vee \| b \| _ {\infty} \leq B ^ {\mathrm {(f c)}} \end{array} \right. \right\}.
$$

Here, the domain of CNNs is restricted to  $[-1, 1]^D$ . Note that we impose norm constraints to the convolution part and fully-connected part separately. Since the notation is cluttered, we sometimes omit the subscripts as we do in the above.

Remark 2. In this paper, we adopted one-sided padding, which is not so often used practically, in order to make proofs simple. However, with slight modifications, all statements are true for equally-padded convolutions, widely employed padding style which adds (approximately) a same number of zeros to both ends of input signals, with the exception that the filter size  $K$  is restricted to  $K \leq \left\lfloor \frac{D}{2} \right\rfloor$  instead of  $K \leq D$ . We also discuss our design choice, especially the comparison with the original ResNet proposed in He et al. (2016) in Section  $G$  of the appendix.

# 3.3 BLOCK-SPARSE FULLY-CONNECTED NEURAL NETWORKS

In this section, we mathematically define FNNs we consider in this paper, in parallel with the CNN case. Our FNN, which we coin a block-sparse FNN, consists of  $M$  possibly dense FNNs (blocks) concatenated in parallel, followed by a single fully-connected layer. We sketch the architecture of a block-sparse FNN in Figure 2.

Definition 2. Let  $M \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$  be the number of blocks in an FNN. Let  $D_{m} = (D_{m}^{(1)},\dots ,D_{m}^{(L_{m})}) \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}^{L_{m}}$  be the sequence of intermediate dimensions of the  $m$ -th block, where  $L_{m} \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$  is the depth of the  $m$ -th block for  $m \in [M]^{2}$ . Let  $W_{m}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{m}^{(l)} \times D_{m}^{(l-1)}}$  and  $b_{m}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}$  be the weight matrix and the bias of the  $l$ -th layer of  $m$ -th block (with the convention  $D_{m}^{(0)} = 1$ ). Let  $w_{m} \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{m}^{(L_{m})}}$  be the weight (sub)matrix of the final fully-connected layer corresponding to the  $m$ -th block and  $b \in \mathbb{R}$  be the bias for the last layer. For  $\pmb{\theta} = ((W_{m}^{(l)})_{m,l}, (b_{m}^{(l)})_{m,l}, (w_{m})_{m}, b)$  and an activation function  $\sigma : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , we define  $\mathrm{FNN}_{\pmb{\theta}}^{\sigma} : \mathbb{R}^{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , the block-sparse FNN constructed from  $\pmb{\theta}$ , by

$$
\mathrm {F N N} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} ^ {\sigma} := \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} w _ {m} ^ {\top} \mathrm {F C} _ {\boldsymbol {W} _ {m}, \boldsymbol {b} _ {m}} ^ {\sigma} (\cdot) - b,
$$

where  $\mathrm{FC}_{\pmb{W}_m,\pmb{b}_m}^{\sigma}:= \mathrm{FC}_{W_m^{(L_m)},b_m^{(L_m)}}^{\sigma}\circ \dots \mathrm{FC}_{W_m^{(1)},b_m^{(1)}}^{\sigma}$ .

We say  $\pmb{\theta}$  is compatible with  $(D_m^{(l)})_{m,l}$  when each component of  $\pmb{\theta}$  matches the dimension conditions determined by  $(D_m^{(l)})_{m,l}$ , as we do in the CNN case. Note that when  $L_{m} = 1$  for all  $m\in [M]$

the block-sparse FNN is a 3-layered neural network with  $D' \coloneqq \sum_{m=1}^{M} D_m^{(1)}$  units of the form  $f(x) = \sum_{d=1}^{D'} b_d \sigma(a_d^\top x - t_d) - b$  where  $a_d \in \mathbb{R}^D, b_d, t_d, b \in \mathbb{R}$ .

For an architecture  $D = (D_m^{(l)})_{m \in [M], l \in [L_m]}$ , a sparse parameter  $S \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$  and norm parameters for the block part  $B^{(\mathrm{bs})} > 0$  and for the final layer  $B^{(\mathrm{fin})} > 0$ , we define  $\mathcal{F}^{(\mathrm{FNN})} = \mathcal{F}_{D,B^{(\mathrm{bs})},B^{(\mathrm{fin})}}^{(\mathrm{FNN})}$ , the set of function realizable by FNNs:

$$
\mathcal {F} ^ {\mathrm {(F N N)}} := \left\{\mathrm {F N N} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} ^ {\mathrm {R e L U}} \left| \begin{array}{l} \boldsymbol {\theta} = ((W _ {m} ^ {(l)}) _ {m, l}, (b _ {m} ^ {(l)}) _ {m, l}, (w _ {m}) _ {m}, b) \text {i s c o m p a t i b l e w i t h} \boldsymbol {D}, \\ \max  _ {m \in [ M ], l \in [ L _ {m} ]} (\| W _ {m} ^ {(l)} \| _ {\infty} \vee \| b _ {m} ^ {(l)} \| _ {\infty}) \leq B ^ {\mathrm {(b s)}}, \\ \max  _ {m \in [ M ]} \| w _ {m} \| _ {\infty} \vee | b | \leq B ^ {\mathrm {(f i n)}}. \end{array} \right. \right\}.
$$

Again, the domain is restricted to  $[-1, 1]^D$ . Similar to the CNN case, we sometimes remove subscripts of the function class for simplicity. We denote the number of scalar parameters (some of which are possibly zero) of  $m$ -th block by  $S(\pmb{D}_m) \coloneqq \sum_{l=1}^{L_m} D_m^{(l-1)} D_m^{(l)}$  and the total parameter counts of an FNN by  $S(\pmb{D}) \coloneqq \sum_{m=1}^{M} S(\pmb{D}_m) + D_m^{(L_m)} + 1$ .

# 4 MAIN THEOREMS

With the preparation in the previous sections, we state our main results of this paper. We only describe statements of theorems and corollaries and key ideas in the main article. All complete proofs are deferred to the appendix.

# 4.1 APPROXIMATION

Our first main theorem claims that any  $M$ -way block-sparse FNN is realizable by a ResNet-type CNN with fixed-sized filters and channels by adding  $O(M)$  parameters, if we treat the width  $D_{m}^{(l)}$  of the FNN as a constant with respect to  $M$ .

Theorem 1. Let  $M \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ ,  $K \in \{2, \ldots, D\}$  and  $L_0 := \left\lceil \frac{D - 1}{K - 1} \right\rceil$ . Let  $L_m \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ ,  $D_m^{(l)} \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ , and  $D = (D_m^{(l)})_{m \in [M], l \in [L_m]}$ . Then there exists  $L \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ ,  $C = (C_m^{(l)})_{m = 0, \ldots, M, l \in [L_m]}$ ,  $K = (K_m^{(l)})_{m = 0, \ldots, M, l \in [L_m]}$ , and  $S \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$  satisfying the following conditions:

1.  $L \leq \sum_{m=1}^{M} L_m + ML_0$ ,  
2.  $\max_{l\in [L]}C^{(l)}\leq 4\max_{m\in [M],l\in [L_m]}D_m^{(l)}$  
3.  $\max_{l\in [L]}K^{(l)}\leq K$  , and  
4.  $S \leq S(\pmb{D}) + \sum_{m=1}^{M}((3D + 4L_0)D_m^{(1)} + D_m^{(L_m)}) + 3,$

such that, for any  $B^{(\mathrm{bs})}$ ,  $B^{(\mathrm{fin})} > 0$ , we have a

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {\boldsymbol {D}, \boldsymbol {B} ^ {(\mathrm {b s})}, \boldsymbol {B} ^ {(\mathrm {f i n})}} ^ {(\mathrm {F N N})} \subset \mathcal {F} _ {\boldsymbol {C}, \boldsymbol {K}, S, \boldsymbol {B} ^ {(\mathrm {c o n v})}, \boldsymbol {B} ^ {(\mathrm {f c})}} ^ {(\mathrm {C N N})}, \tag {1}
$$

that is, any FNN in  $\mathcal{F}_{\pmb{D},B^{(\mathrm{bs})},B^{(\mathrm{fin})}}^{\mathrm{(FNN)}}$  can be realized by a CNN in  $\mathcal{F}_{\pmb{C},\pmb{K},S,B^{(\mathrm{conv})},B^{(\mathrm{fc})}}^{\mathrm{(CNN)}}$ . Here,  $B^{(\mathrm{conv})} = B^{(\mathrm{bs})}$  and  $B^{(\mathrm{fc})} = B^{(\mathrm{fin})}\left(1\vee \frac{1}{B^{(bs)}}\right)$ .

An immediate consequence of this theorem is that if we can approximate a function  $f^{\circ}$  with a block-sparse FNN, we can also approximate  $f^{\circ}$  with a CNN.

# 4.2 ESTIMATION

Our second main theorem bounds the estimation error of the regularized ERM estimator  $\hat{f}$ .

Theorem 2. Let  $f^{\circ}:\mathbb{R}^{D}\to \mathbb{R}$  be a measurable function and  $B^{(\mathrm{bs})},B^{(\mathrm{fin})} > 0$ . Let  $M, K, L_0, L_m, D, B^{(\mathrm{conv})}$  and  $B^{(\mathrm{fc})}$  as in Theorem 1. Suppose  $L,C,K,S$  satisfies the equation (1) of Theorem 1

for  $B^{(\mathrm{bs})}$  and  $B^{(\mathrm{fin})}$  (their existence is ensured for any  $B^{(\mathrm{bs})}$  and  $B^{(\mathrm{fin})}$  if they satisfy the conditions 1-4. of Theorem 1). Suppose that the covering nubmer of  $\mathcal{F}^{(\mathrm{CNN})} := \mathcal{F}_{\pmb{C},\pmb{K},\pmb{S},\pmb{B}^{(\mathrm{conv})},\pmb{B}^{(\mathrm{fc})}}^{(\mathrm{CNN})}$  is larger than 3. Then, the regularized ERM estimator  $\hat{f}$  in  $\mathcal{F} := \{\mathrm{clip}[f] \mid f \in \mathcal{F}^{(\mathrm{CNN})}\}$  satisfies

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {D}} \| \hat {f} - f ^ {\circ} \| _ {\mathcal {L} ^ {2} \left(\mathcal {P} _ {X}\right)} ^ {2} \leq C \left(\inf  _ {f \in \mathcal {F} ^ {\left(\mathrm {F N N}\right)}} \| f - f ^ {\circ} \| _ {\infty} ^ {2} + \frac {S \tilde {F} ^ {2}}{N} (\log 2 M _ {1} M _ {2} B N)\right). \tag {2}
$$

Here,  $\mathcal{F}^{(\mathrm{FNN})} := \mathcal{F}_{\pmb{D},B^{(\mathrm{bs})},B^{(\mathrm{fin})}}^{(\mathrm{FNN})}$ ,  $C > 0$  is a universal constant,  $\tilde{F} := \frac{\|f^{\circ}\|_{\infty}}{\sigma} \vee 1$ ,  $B = B^{(\mathrm{bs})} \vee B^{(\mathrm{fin})}$ .  $M_1$  and  $M_2$  are defined by

$$
M _ {1} := (M + 2) (S \wedge C _ {0} ^ {(L _ {0})} D) (1 \vee B ^ {(\mathrm {c o n v})}) (1 \vee B ^ {(\mathrm {f c})}) \left(\prod_ {m = 0} ^ {M} (1 + \rho_ {m})\right) \left(\sum_ {m = 0} ^ {M} L _ {m} \rho_ {m} ^ {+}\right),
$$

$$
M _ {2} := \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \sum_ {l = 1} ^ {L _ {m}} \left(C _ {m} ^ {(l - 1)} C _ {m} ^ {(l)} K _ {m} ^ {(l)} + C _ {m} ^ {(l)}\right) + C _ {0} ^ {(L _ {0})} D + 1,
$$

where  $\rho_{m}:= \prod_{l = 1}^{L_{m}}C_{m}^{(l - 1)}K_{m}^{(l)}B^{\mathrm{(bs)}}$  and  $\rho_{m}^{+}:= \prod_{l = 1}^{L_{m}}(1\vee C_{m}^{(l - 1)}K_{m}^{(l)}B^{\mathrm{(bs)}})$

The first term of (2) is the approximation error achieved by  $\mathcal{F}^{(\mathrm{FNN})}$ . We note that  $M_{1}$  and  $M_{2}$  are determined by the architectural parameters of  $\mathcal{F}^{(\mathrm{CNN})} - M_{1}$  corresponds to the Lipschitz constant and  $M_{2}$  is the number of parameters, including zeros, of a CNN. Therefore, the second term of (2) represents the model complexity of  $\mathcal{F}^{(\mathrm{CNN})}$ . There is a trade-off between the two. Using appropriately chosen  $M$  to balance these two terms, we can evaluate the order of estimation error with respect to the sample size  $N$ .

Corollary 1. Under the same assumptions as Theorem 2, suppose further  $\log M_1M_2(B^{(\mathrm{bs})}\vee$ $B^{(\mathrm{fin})}) = \tilde{O} (1)$  as a function of  $M$ . If  $\inf_{f\in \mathcal{F}^{(\mathrm{FNN})}}\| f - f^{\circ}\|_{\infty}^{2} = \tilde{O}(M^{-\gamma_1})$  and  $S = \tilde{O} (M^{\gamma_2})$  for some constant  $\gamma_1,\gamma_2 > 0$  independent of  $M$ , then, the regularized ERM estimator  $\hat{f}$  of  $\mathcal{F}$  achieves the estimation error  $\| f^{\circ} - \hat{f}\|_{\mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{P}_X)}^2 = \tilde{O}_p\left(N^{-\frac{2\gamma_1}{2\gamma_1 + \gamma_2}}\right)$ .

# 5 APPLICATION OF MAIN THEOREMS

# 5.1 BARRONCLASS

The Barron class is an example of the function class that can be approximated by block-sparse FNNs. We employ the definition of Barron functions used in Klusowski & Barron (2016).

Definition 3. We say a measurable function  $f: [-1,1]^D \to \mathbb{R}$  is a Barron function with the parameter  $s > 0$  if  $f$  admits the Fourier representation:  $f(x) = \check{\mathcal{F}}\mathcal{F}[f]$  and  $v_{f} := \int_{\mathbb{R}^{D}} \| w \|_{2}^{s} |\mathcal{F}[f](w)| \, \mathrm{d}w < \infty$ . Here,  $\mathcal{F}$  and  $\check{\mathcal{F}}$  are the Fourier transformation and the inverse Fourier transformation, respectively.

Klusowski & Barron (2016) studied the approximation of the Barron function  $f^{\circ}$  with the parameter  $s = 2$  by a linear combination of  $M$  ridge functions (i.e., a 3-layered ReLU FNN). Specifically, they showed that there exists a function  $f_{M}$  of the form

$$
f _ {M} := f ^ {\circ} (0) + \nabla f ^ {\circ \top} (0) x + \frac {1}{M} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} b _ {m} \left(a _ {m} ^ {\top} x - t _ {m}\right) _ {+} \tag {3}
$$

with  $|b_m| \leq 1$ ,  $\| a_m\|_1$  and  $|t_m| \leq 1$ , such that  $\| f^\circ - f_M\|_\infty = \tilde{O}\left(M^{-\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{D}\right)}\right)$ . Using this approximator  $f_M$ , we can derive the same approximation order using CNNs by applying Theorem 1 with  $M = 1$  and  $L_1 = 1$ .

Corollary 2. Let  $f^{\circ}:[-1,1]^{D}\to \mathbb{R}$  be a Barron function with the parameter  $s = 2$  such that  $f^{\circ}(0) = 0$  and  $\nabla f^{\circ}(0) = \mathbf{0}_D$ . Then, for any  $K = 2,\ldots ,D$ , there exists a CNN  $f^{(\mathrm{CNN})}$  with  $M$  non-zero parameters, whose depth is  $O(M)$ , which has at most 8 channels, and whose filter size is at most  $K$ , such that  $\| f^{\circ} - f^{(\mathrm{CNN})}\|_{\infty} = \tilde{O}\left(M^{-\left(\frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{D}\right)}\right)$ .

We have one design choice when we apply Corollary 1 to derive the estimation error: how to set  $B^{(\mathrm{bs})}$  and  $B^{(\mathrm{fin})}$ . Looking at (3), the naive choice would be  $B^{(\mathrm{bs})} := 1$  and  $B^{(\mathrm{fin})} := \frac{1}{M}$ . However, this cannot satisfy the assumption on  $M_1$  of Corollary 1, due to the term  $\prod_{m=0}^{M} (1 + \rho_m)$  in  $M_1$ . We want the logarithm of  $\prod_{m=0}^{M} (1 + \rho_m)$  to be  $\tilde{O}(1)$ . In order to do that, we change the relative scale between parameters in the block-sparse part and the fully-connected part using the homogeneous property of the ReLU function:  $\operatorname{ReLU}(ax) = a\operatorname{ReLU}(x)$  for  $a > 0$ . The rescaling operation enables us to choose  $B^{(\mathrm{bs})} := \frac{1}{M}$  and  $B^{(\mathrm{fin})} := 1$  to meet the assumption of Corollary 1. By setting  $\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{D}$  and  $\gamma_2 = 1$ , we obtain the desired estimation error.

Corollary 3. There exist the depth  $L = O\left(N^{\frac{D}{2 + 2D}}\right)$ , channel size  $C = O(1)$ , filter size  $K \in \{2, \ldots, D\}$ , the number of non-zero parameters  $S = O\left(N^{\frac{D}{2 + 2D}}\right)$ , norm bounds for the convolution part  $B^{(\mathrm{conv})} = O\left(N^{\frac{-D}{2 + 2D}}\right)$ , and for the fully-connected part  $B^{(\mathrm{fc})} = O\left(N^{\frac{D}{2 + 2D}}\right)$  such that for sufficiently large  $N$ , the regularized ERM estimator  $\hat{f}$  of  $\mathcal{F} := \{\mathrm{clip}[f] \mid f \in \mathcal{F}_{\pmb{C},\pmb{K},S,B^{(\mathrm{conv})},B^{(\mathrm{fc})}}^{\mathrm{(CNN)}}\}$  achieve the estimation error  $\| f^{\circ} - \hat{f}\|_{\mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{P}_X)}^2 = \tilde{O}_p\left(N^{-\frac{D + 2}{2(D + 1)}}\right)$ . Here,  $\pmb{C} = (C,\dots,C) \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}^L$  and  $\pmb{K} = (K,\dots,K) \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}^L$ .

# 5.2 Hölder CLASS

Yarotsky (2017) showed that FNNs with  $O(M)$  non-zero parameters can approximate any  $D$  variate  $\beta$ -Hölder function  $(\beta > 0)$  with the order of  $\tilde{O}(M^{-\frac{\beta}{D}})$ . Schmidt-Hieber (2017) also proved a similar statement using a different construction method. They only specified their width (Schmidt-Hieber (2017) only), depth, and non-zero parameter counts of the approximating FNN explicitly in their statements and did not write in detail how non-zero parameters are distributed (see Theorem 1 of Yarotsky (2017) and Theorem 5 of Schmidt-Hieber (2017)). However, if we carefully look at their proofs, we find that we can transform the FNNs they constructed into the block-sparse ones. Therefore, we can utilize these FNNs and apply Theorem 1. To meet the assumption of Corollary 1, we again rescale the parameters of the FNNs, as we do in the Barron class case, so that  $B^{(\mathrm{conv})} = O\left(\frac{1}{M}\right)$ . We can derive the approximation error and estimation error by setting  $\gamma_1 = \frac{\beta}{D}$  and  $\gamma_2 = 1$ .

Corollary 4. Let  $\beta >0$ , and  $f^{\circ}:[-1,1]^{D}\to \mathbb{R}$  be a  $\beta$ -Hölder function. Then, for any  $K = 2,\ldots ,D$ , there exists a CNN  $f^{(\mathrm{CNN})}$  with  $M$  parameters, whose depth is  $O(M\log M)$ , which has  $O(1)$  channels, and whose filter size is at most  $K$ , such that  $\| f^{\circ} - f^{(\mathrm{CNN})}\|_{\infty} = \tilde{O}\left(M^{-\frac{\beta}{D}}\right)$ .

Corollary 5. There exist the depth  $L = O\left(N^{\frac{D}{2 + 2D}} \log N\right)$ , channel size  $C = O(1)$ , filter size  $K \in \{2, \ldots, D\}$ , the number of non-zero parameters  $S = O\left(N^{\frac{D}{2 + 2D}} \log N\right)$ , norm bounds for the convolution part  $B^{(\mathrm{conv})} = O(1)$ , and for the fully-connected part  $B^{(\mathrm{fc})} = O(1)$  such that for sufficiently large  $N$ , the regularized ERM estimator  $\hat{f}$  of  $\mathcal{F} := \{\mathrm{clip}[f] \mid f \in \mathcal{F}_{\pmb{C},\pmb{K},S,B^{(\mathrm{conv})},B^{(\mathrm{fc})}}^{(\mathrm{CNN})}\}$  achieve the estimation error  $\| f^{\circ} - \hat{f} \|_{\mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{P}_X)}^2 = \tilde{O}_p\left(N^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta + D}}\right)$ . Here,  $\pmb{C} = (C,\dots,C) \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}^L$  and  $\pmb{K} = (K,\dots,K) \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}^L$ .

Since the estimation error rate of the  $\beta$ -Hölder class is  $O_p\left(N^{-\frac{2D}{2\beta + D}}\right)$  (see, e.g., Tsybakov (2008)), Corollary 5 implies that our CNN can achieve the minimax optimal rate up to logarithmic factors even the width  $D$ , the channel size  $C$ , and the filter size  $K$  are constant with respect to the sample size  $N$ .

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we established new approximation and statistical learning theories for CNNs by utilizing the ResNet-type architecture of CNNs and the block-sparse structure of FNNs. We proved that any  $M$ -way block-sparse FNN is realizable using CNNs with  $O(M)$  additional parameters, when

the width of the FNN is fixed. Using this result, we derived the approximation and estimation errors for CNNs from those for block-sparse FNNs. Our theory is general because it does not depend on a specific function class, as long as we can approximate it with block-sparse FNNs. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our results, we derived the approximation and error rates for the Barron class and the Hölder class in almost same manner and showed that the estimation error of CNNs is same as that of FNNs, even if the CNNs have constant width, filter size, and channel size with respect to the sample size. The key techniques were careful evaluations of the Lipschitz constant of CNNs and non-trivial weight parameter rescaling of FNNs.

One of the interesting open questions is the role of the weight rescaling. We critically use the homogeneous property of the ReLU activation function to change the relative scale between the block sparse part and the fully-connected part, if it were not for this property, the estimation error rate would be worse. The general theory for rescaling, not restricted to the Barron nor the Hölder class would be beneficial for deeper understanding of the relationship between approximation and estimation abilities of FNNs and CNNs.

Another question is when the approximation and estimation error rate of CNNs can exceed that of FNNs. We can derive the same approximation and estimation rate as FNNs essentially because we can realize block-sparse FNNs using CNNs that have the same order of parameters (see Theorem 1). Therefore, if we dig into the internal structure of FNNs, like repetition, more carefully, the CNNs might need fewer parameters and can achieve better estimation error rate. Note that, there is no hope to enhance this rate for the Hölder case (up to logarithmic factors) because the estimation rate using FNNs is already minimax optimal. It is left for future research which function classes and constraints of FNNs, like block-sparsseness, we should choose.
