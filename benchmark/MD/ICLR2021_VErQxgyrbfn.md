# ABSTRACT

Neural networks have shown tremendous potential for reconstructing high-resolution images in inverse problems. The non-convex and opaque nature of neural networks, however, hinders their utility in sensitive applications such as medical imaging. To cope with this challenge, this paper advocates a convex duality framework that makes a two-layer fully-convolitional ReLU denoising network amenable to convex optimization. The convex dual network not only offers the optimum training with convex solvers, but also facilitates interpreting training and prediction. In particular, it implies training neural networks with weight decay regularization induces path sparsity while the prediction is piecewise linear filtering. A range of experiments with MNIST and fastMRI datasets confirm the efficacy of the dual network optimization problem.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In the age of AI, image reconstruction has witnessed a paradigm shift that impacts several applications ranging from natural image super-resolution to medical imaging. Compared with the traditional iterative algorithms, AI has delivered significant improvements in speed and image quality, making learned reconstruction based on neural networks widely adopted in clinical scanners and personal devices. The non-convex and opaque nature of deep neural networks however raises serious concerns about the authenticity of the predicted pixels in domains as sensitive as medical imaging. It is thus crucial to understand what the trained neural networks represent, and interpret their reconstruction per pixel for unseen images.

Reconstruction is typically cast as an inverse problem, where neural networks are used in different ways to create effective priors; see e.g., (Ongie et al., 2020; Mardani et al., 2018b) and references therein. An important class of methods are denoising networks, which given natural data corrupted by some noisy process  $\mathbf{Y}$ , aim to regress the ground-truth, noise-free data  $\mathbf{X}_{*}$  (Gondara, 2016; Vincent et al., 2010). These networks are generally learned in a supervised fashion, such that a mapping  $f: \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{X}$  is learned from inputs  $\{\pmb{y}_i\}_{i=1}^n$  to outputs  $\{\pmb{x}_{*i}\}_{i=1}^n$ , and then can be used in the inference phase on new samples  $\hat{\pmb{y}}$  to generate the prediction  $\hat{\pmb{x}}_{*} = f(\hat{\pmb{y}})$ .

The scope of denoising networks is so general that it can cover more structured inverse problems appearing, for example, in compressed sensing. In this case one can easily form a poor (linear) estimate of the ground-truth image that is noisy and then reconstruct via end-to-end denoising networks (Mardani et al., 2018b; Mousavi et al., 2015). This method has been proven quite effective on tasks such as medical image reconstruction (Mardani et al., 2018b;a; Sandino et al., 2020; Hammernik et al., 2018), and significantly outperforms sparsity-inducing convex denoising methods, such as total-variation (TV) and wavelet regularization (Candès et al., 2006; Lustig et al., 2008; Donoho, 2006) in terms of both quality and speed.

Despite their encouraging results and growing use in clinical settings (Sandino et al., 2020; Hammernik et al., 2018; Mousavi et al., 2015), little work has explored the interpretation of supervised training of over-parameterized neural networks for inverse problems. Whereas robustness guarantees exist for inverse problems with minimization of convex sparsity-inducing objectives (Oymak & Hassibi, 2016; Chandrasekaran et al., 2012), there exist no such guarantees for predictions of non-convex denoising neural networks based on supervised training. In fact, it has been demonstrated empirically that deep neural networks for image reconstruction can be

unstable; i.e., small perturbations in the input can cause severe artifacts in the reconstruction, which can mask relevant structural features, which are important for medical image interpretation (Antun et al., 2020).

The main challenge in explaining these effects emanate from the non-linear and non-convex structure of deep neural networks that are heuristically optimized via first-order stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based solvers such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014). As a result, it is hard to interpret the inference phase, and the training samples can alter the predictions for unseen images. To cope with these challenges, we present a convex-duality framework for two-layer denoising networks with fully convolutional (conv.) layers with ReLU activation and the representation shared among all output pixels. In essence, inspired by the analysis by Pilanci & Ergen (2020), the zero-duality gap offers a convex bi-dual formulation for the original non-convex objective, that demands only polynomial variable count.

The benefits of the convex dual are three-fold. First, with the convex dual, one can leverage off-the-shelf convex solvers to guarantee convergence to the global optimum in polynomial time and provides robustness guarantees for reconstruction. Second, it provides an interpretation of the training with weight decay regularization as implicit regularization with path-sparsity, a form of capacity control of neural networks (Neyshabur et al., 2015). Third, the convex dual interprets CNN-based denoising as first dividing the input image patches into clusters, based on their latent representation, and then linear filtering is applied for patches in the same cluster. A range of experiments are performed with MNIST and fastMRI reconstruction that confirm the zero-duality gap, interpretability, and practicality of the convex formulation.

All in all, the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

- We, for the first time, formulate a convex program with polynomial complexity for neural image reconstruction, which is provably identical to a two-layer fully-conv. ReLU network.  
- We provide novel interpretations of the training objective with weight decay as path-sparsity regularization, and prediction as patch-based clustering and linear filtering.  
- We present extensive experiments for MNIST and fastMRI reconstruction that our convex dual coincides with the non-convex neural network, and interpret the learned dual networks.

# 2 RELATED WORK

This paper is at the intersection of two lines of work, namely, convex neural networks, and deep learning for inverse problems. Convex neural networks were introduced in (Bach, 2017; Bengio et al., 2006), and later in (Pilanci & Ergen, 2020; Ergen & Pilanci, 2020a;b). The most relevant to our work are (Pilanci & Ergen, 2020; Ergen & Pilanci, 2020b) which put forth a convex duality framework for two-layer ReLU networks with a single output. It presents a convex alternative in a higher dimensional space for the non-convex and finite-dimensional neural network. It is however restricted to scalar-output networks, and considers either fully-connected networks (Pilanci & Ergen, 2020), or, CNNs with average pooling (Ergen & Pilanci, 2020b). Our work however focuses on fully convolutional denoising with an output dimension as large as the number of image pixels, where these pixels share the same hidden representation. This is indeed quite different from the setting considered in (Pilanci & Ergen, 2020) and demands a different treatment.

In recent years, deep learning has been widely deployed in inverse problems to either learn effective priors for iterative algorithms (Bora et al., 2017), or to directly learn the inversion map using feedforward networks (Jin et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). This work belongs to the second group, which is of utmost interest in real-time applications, and thus widely adopted in medical image reconstruction. Compressed sensing (CS) MRI has been a successful fit, where knowing the forward acquisition model, one forms an initial linear estimate, and trains a non-linear CNNs to de-alias the input (Mardani et al., 2018a). Further, unrolled architectures inspired by convex optimization have been developed for robust de-aliasing (Sun et al., 2016; Mardani et al., 2018b; Hammernik et al., 2018; Sandino et al., 2020; Diamond et al., 2017). Past work however are all based on non-convex training of network filters, and interpretability is not their focus. Note that stability of iterative neural reconstructions has also been recently analyzed in Li et al. (2020); Mukherjee et al. (2020).

# 3 PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM STATEMENT

Consider the problem of denoising, i.e. reconstructing clean signals from ones which have been corrupted by noise. In particular, we are given a dataset of  $2\mathrm{D}^1$  images  $\mathbf{X}_{*}\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times h\times w}$ , along with their corrupted counterparts  $\pmb {Y} = \pmb {X}_* + \pmb{E}$ , where noise  $\pmb{E}$  has entries drawn from some probability distribution, such as  $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$  in the case of i.i.d. Gaussian noise. This is a fundamental problem, with a wide range of applications including medical imaging, image restoration, and image encryption problems (Jiang et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2018; Lan et al., 2019).

To solve the denoising problem, we deploy a two-layer CNN, where the first layer has an arbitrary kernel size  $k$  and appropriately chosen padding, followed by an element-wise ReLU operation denoted by  $(\cdot)_+$ . The second and final layer of the network performs a conv. by a  $1 \times 1$  kernel to generate the predictions of the network. The predictions generated by this neural network with  $m$  first-layer conv. filters  $\{\pmb{u}_j\}_{j=1}^m$  and second-layer conv. filters  $\{\pmb{v}_j\}_{j=1}^m$  can be expressed as

$$
f (\boldsymbol {Y}) = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \left(\boldsymbol {Y} * \boldsymbol {u} _ {j}\right) _ {+} * \boldsymbol {v} _ {j} \tag {1}
$$

where  $\text{串}$  represents the 2D conv. operation.

# 3.1 TRAINING

We then seek to minimize the squared loss of the predictions of the network, along with an  $\ell_2$ -norm penalty (weight decay) on the network weights, to obtain the training problem

$$
p ^ {*} = \min  _ {\substack {\boldsymbol {u} _ {j} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {k \times k} \\ v _ {j} \in \mathbb {R}}} \frac {1}{2} \| \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} (\boldsymbol {Y} * \boldsymbol {u} _ {j}) _ {+} * v _ {j} - \boldsymbol {X} _ {*} \| _ {F} ^ {2} + \frac {\beta}{2} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \left(\| \boldsymbol {u} _ {j} \| _ {F} ^ {2} + | v _ {j} | ^ {2}\right) \tag{2}
$$

The network's output can also be understood in terms of matrix-vector products, when the input is appropriately expressed in terms of patch matrices  $\{\mathbf{Y}_p\in \mathbb{R}^{k^2}\}_{p = 1}^{Nhw}$ , where each patch matrix corresponds to a patch of the image upon which a convolutional kernel will operate upon. Then, we can form the two-dimensional matrix input to the network as  $\mathbf{Y}' = [\mathbf{Y}_1,\mathbf{Y}_2,\dots ,\mathbf{Y}_{Nhw}]^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{Nhw\times k^2}$ , and attempt to regress labels  $\mathbf{X}_{*}^{\prime}\in \mathbb{R}^{Nhw}$ , which is a flattened vector of the clean images  $\mathbf{X}_{*}$ . An equivalent form of the two-layer CNN training problem is thus given by

$$
p ^ {*} = \min  _ {\substack {\boldsymbol {u} _ {j} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {k ^ {2}} \\ v _ {j} \in \mathbb {R}}} \frac {1}{2} \| \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \left(\boldsymbol {Y} ^ {\prime} \boldsymbol {u} _ {j}\right) _ {+} v _ {j} - \boldsymbol {X} _ {*} ^ {\prime} \| _ {2} ^ {2} + \frac {\beta}{2} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \left(\| \boldsymbol {u} _ {j} \| _ {2} ^ {2} + | v _ {j} | ^ {2}\right) \tag{3}
$$

In this form, the neural network training problem is equivalent to a 2-layer fully connected scalar-output ReLU network with  $Nhw$  samples of dimension  $k^2$ , which has previously been theoretically analyzed (Pilanci & Ergen, 2020). We also note that for a fixed kernel-size  $k$ , the patch data matrix  $Y'$  has a fixed rank, since the rank of  $Y'$  cannot exceed the number of columns  $k^2$ .

# 3.2 RELU HYPER-PLANE ARRANGEMENTS

To fully understand the convex formulation of the neural network proposed in (2), we must provide notation for understanding the hyper-plane arrangements of the network. We consider the set of diagonal matrices

$$
\mathcal {D} := \left\{\operatorname {D i a g} \left(\mathbf {1} _ {\mathbf {Y} ^ {\prime} \mathbf {u} \geq 0}\right): \| \mathbf {u} \| _ {2} \leq 1 \right\}
$$

This set, which depends on  $\mathbf{Y}'$ , stores the set of activation patterns corresponding to the ReLU nonlinearity, where a value of 1 indicates that the neuron is active, while 0 indicates that the neuron is inactive. In particular, we can enumerate the set of sign patterns as  $\mathcal{D} = \{D_i\}_{i=1}^{\ell}$ , where  $\ell$  depends on  $\mathbf{Y}'$  and is bounded by

$$
\ell \leq 2 r \left(\frac {e (N h w - 1)}{r}\right) ^ {r}
$$

for  $r \coloneqq \operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{Y}')$  (Pilanci & Ergen, 2020). Thus,  $P$  is polynomial in  $Nhw$  for matrices with a fixed rank  $r$ , which occurs for convolutions with a fixed kernel size  $k$ . Using these sign patterns, we can completely characterize the range space of the first layer after the ReLU:

$$
\left\{\left(\boldsymbol {Y} ^ {\prime} \boldsymbol {u}\right) _ {+}: \| \boldsymbol {u} \| _ {2} \leq 1 \right\} = \left\{\boldsymbol {D} _ {i} \boldsymbol {Y} ^ {\prime} \boldsymbol {u}: \| \boldsymbol {u} \| _ {2} \leq 1, (2 \boldsymbol {D} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {I}) \boldsymbol {Y} ^ {\prime} \boldsymbol {u} \geq 0, i \in [ \ell ] \right\}
$$

With this notation established, we are ready to present our main theoretical result.

# 4 CONVEX DUALITY

Theorem 1. There exists an  $m^* \leq Nhw$  such that if the number of conv. filters  $m \geq m^* + 1$ , the two-layer conv. network with ReLU activation (2) has a strong dual. This dual is a finite-dimensional convex program, given by

$$
d ^ {*} = \min  _ {\substack {(2 D _ {i} - I) Y ^ {\prime} \boldsymbol {w} _ {i} \geq 0 \\ (2 D _ {i} - I) Y ^ {\prime} \boldsymbol {z} _ {i} \geq 0}} \frac {1}{2} \| \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\ell} D _ {i} Y ^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {w} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {z} _ {i}) - X _ {*} ^ {\prime} \| _ {2} ^ {2} + \beta \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\ell} \left(\| \boldsymbol {w} _ {i} \| _ {2} + \| \boldsymbol {z} _ {i} \| _ {2}\right) \tag{4}
$$

where  $\ell$  refers to the number of sign patterns associated with  $\mathbf{Y}'$ . Furthermore, given a set of optimal dual weights  $(\boldsymbol{w}_i^*, \boldsymbol{z}_i^*)_{i=1}^\ell$ , we can reconstruct the optimal primal weights as follows

$$
\left(\boldsymbol {u} _ {i} ^ {*}, \boldsymbol {v} _ {i} ^ {*}\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \left(\frac {\boldsymbol {w} _ {i} ^ {*}}{\sqrt {\| \boldsymbol {w} _ {i} ^ {*} \| _ {2}}}, \sqrt {\| \boldsymbol {w} _ {i} ^ {*} \| _ {2}}\right) & \boldsymbol {w} _ {i} ^ {*} \neq 0 \\ \left(\frac {\boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {*}}{\sqrt {\| \boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {*} \| _ {2}}}, \sqrt {\| \boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {*} \| _ {2}}\right) & \boldsymbol {z} _ {i} ^ {*} \neq 0 \end{array} \right. \tag {5}
$$

It is useful to recognize that the convex program has  $2\ell Nhw$  constraints and  $2\ell k^2$  variables, which can be solved in polynomial time with respect to  $N$ ,  $h$  and  $w$  using standard convex optimizers. Further, this result can easily be extended to a residual architecture as stated next.

Corollary 1.1. Consider a residual two-layer network given by

$$
f _ {r e s} (\boldsymbol {Y}) = \boldsymbol {Y} + \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \left(\boldsymbol {Y} * \boldsymbol {u} _ {j}\right) _ {+} * \boldsymbol {v} _ {j} \tag {6}
$$

We can also pose the convex dual network (4) in a similar fashion, where now we simply regress upon the residual labels  $\mathbf{X}_{*} - \mathbf{Y}$ .

# 4.1 IMPLICIT REGULARIZATION

In this section, we discuss the implicit regularization induced by the weight decay in the primal model (3). In particular, each dual variable  $\boldsymbol{w}_i$  or  $z_i$  represents a path from the input to the output, since the product of corresponding primal weights is given by

$$
\boldsymbol {u} _ {i} ^ {*} \boldsymbol {v} _ {i} ^ {*} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \boldsymbol {w} _ {i} ^ {*} & \boldsymbol {w} _ {i} ^ {*} \neq 0 \\ z _ {i} ^ {*} & z _ {i} ^ {*} \neq 0 \end{array} \right. \tag {7}
$$

Thus, the sparsity-inducing group-lasso penalty on the dual weights  $\boldsymbol{w}_i$  and  $\boldsymbol{z}_i$  induces sparsity in the paths of the primal model. In particular, a penalty is ascribed to  $\| \boldsymbol{w}_i \|_2 + \| \boldsymbol{z}_i \|_2$ , which in terms of primal weights corresponds to a penalty on  $|v_i| \| \boldsymbol{u}_i \|_2$ . This sort of penalty has been explored previously in (Neyshabur et al., 2015), and refers to the path-based regularizer from their work.

# 4.2 INTERPRETABLE RECONSTRUCTION

The convex dual model (4) allows us to understand how an output pixel is predicted from a particular patch. Note that in this formulation, each input patch is regressed upon the center pixel of the output. In particular, for an input patch  $\pmb{y}_p'$ , the prediction of the network corresponding to the  $p$ -th output pixel is given by

$$
f \left(\boldsymbol {y} _ {p} ^ {\prime}\right) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\ell} d _ {i} ^ {(p)} \boldsymbol {y} _ {p} ^ {\prime \top} \left(\boldsymbol {w} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {z} _ {i}\right) \tag {8}
$$

(b) Dual Network

where  $d_{i}^{(p)} \in \{0,1\}$  refers to the  $p$ th diagonal element of  $D_{i}$ . Thus, for an individual patch  $y_{p}^{\prime}$ , the network can be interpreted as first selecting relevant sets of linear filters for that individual patch, and then taking a sum of the inner product of the patch with those filters—a piece-wise linear filtering operation. Thus, once it is identified which filters are active for a particular patch, the network's predictions are given as linear. This interpretation of the dual network contrasts with the opaque understanding of the primal network, in which due to the non-linear ReLU operation it is unclear how to interpret its predictions, as shown in Fig. 1.

Furthermore, because of the group-lasso penalty (Yuan & Lin, 2006) on  $\boldsymbol{w}_i$  and  $\boldsymbol{z}_i$  in the dual objective, these weights are sparse. Thus, for particular patch  $\boldsymbol{y}_p'$ , only a few sign patterns  $d_i^{(p)}$  influence its prediction. Therefore, different patches are implicitly clustered by the network according to the linear weights  $\boldsymbol{w}_i - \boldsymbol{z}_i$  which are active for their predictions. A forward pass of the network can thus be considered as first a clustering operation, followed by a linear filtering operation for each individual cluster. As the neural network becomes deeper, we expect that this clustering becomes hierarchical-at each layer, the clusters become more complex, and capture more contextual information from surrounding patches.

# 4.3 DEEP NETWORKS

While the result of Theorem 1 holds only for two-layer fully conv. networks, these networks are essential for interpreting the implicit regularization and reconstruction of deeper neural networks. For one, these two-layer networks can be greedily trained to build a successively richer representation of the input. This allows for increased field of view for the piecewise linear filters to operate upon, along with allowing for more complex clustering of input patches. This approach is not dissimilar to the end-to-end denoising networks described by Mardani et al. (2018b), though it is more interpretable due to the simplicity of the convex dual of each successive trained layer.

This layer-wise training has been found to be successful in a variety of contexts. Greedily pre-training denoising autoencoders layer-wise has been shown to improve classification performance in deep networks (Vincent et al., 2010). Greedy layer-wise supervised training has also been shown to perform competitively with much deeper end-to-end trained networks on image classification tasks (Belilovsky et al., 2019). Although analyzing the behavior of end-to-end trained deep networks is outside the scope of this work, we expect that end-to-end models are similar to networks trained greedily layerwise, which can fully be interpreted with our convex dual model.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

# 5.1 MNIST DENOISING

Dataset. We use a subset of the MNIST handwritten digits (LeCun et al., 1998). In particular, for training, we select 600 gray-scale  $28 \times 28$  images, pixel-wise normalized by the mean and standard deviation over the entire dataset. The full test dataset of 10,000 images is used for evaluation.

Training. We seek to solve the task of denoising the images from the MNIST dataset. In particular, we add i.i.d. noise from the distribution  $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$  for various noise levels,  $\sigma \in \{0.25, 0.5, 0.75\}$ . The resulting noisy images,  $Y$ , are the inputs to our network, and we attempt to learn the clean images  $X_*$ . We train both the primal network (2) and the dual network (4) using Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014). For the primal network, we use 512 filters, whereas for the dual network, we randomly sample 8,000 sign patterns  $D_i$  as an approximation to the full set of sign patterns  $\ell$ . Further experimental details can be found in the appendix.

Zero duality gap. We find that for this denoising problem, there is no gap between the primal and dual objective values across all values of  $\sigma$  tested, verifying the theoretical result of Theorem 1, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. This is irrespective of the sign-pattern approximation, wherein we select only 8,000 sign patterns for the dual network, rather than enumerating the entire set of  $\ell$  patterns. The illustrations of reconstructed images in Fig.3 also makes it clear that the primal and dual reconstructions are of similar quality.

Interpretable reconstruction. Further, we can interpret what these networks have learned using our knowledge of the dual network. In particular, we can visualize both the sparsity of the learned filters, and the network's clustering of input patches. Because of the piece-wise linear nature of the dual network, we can visualize the dual filters  $\boldsymbol{w}_i$  or  $z_i$  as linear filters for the selected sign patterns. Thus, the frequency response of these filters explains the filtering behavior of the end-to-end network, where depending on the input patch, different filters are activated. We visualize this frequency response of the dual weights  $\boldsymbol{w}_i$  in Fig. 4, where we randomly select 600 representative filters of size  $28 \times 28$ . We note that because of the path sparsity induced by the group-Lasso penalty on the dual weights, some of these dual filters are essentially null filters.

The clustering of input patches can be detected via the set of sign patterns  $d_i^{(p)}$  which correspond to non-zero filters for each output pixel  $p$ . Each output pixel  $p$  can thus be represented by a binary vector  $\boldsymbol{d}^{(p)} \in \{0,1\}^{\ell}$ . We thus feed the trained network clean test images and interpret how they are clustered, using k-means clustering with  $k = 12$  to interpret the similarity among these binary

vectors for each output pixel of an image. Visualizations of these clusters can be found in Fig. 5(a).

We can also use this clustering interpretation for deeper networks, even those trained end-to-end. We consider a four-layer architecture, which consists of two unrolled iterations of the two-layer architecture from the previous experiment, trained end-to-end. We can perform the same k-means clustering on the implicit representation obtained from each unrolled iteration, using the interpretation from the dual network. This result is demonstrated in Fig. 5(b), where we find that the clustering is more complex in the second iteration than the first, as expected. We note that while this network was trained end-to-end, the clusters from the first iteration are nearly identical to those of the single unrolled iteration, indicating that the early layers of end-to-end trained deeper denoising networks learn similar clusters to those of two-layer denoising networks.

# 5.2 MRI RECONSTRUCTION

MRI acquisition. In multi-coil MRI, the forward problem for each patient admits  $\pmb{y}_i = \Omega \pmb{F} \pmb{S}_i \pmb{x} + \pmb{e}_i, i = 1, \dots, n_c$  where  $\pmb{F}$  is the 2D discrete Fourier transform,  $\{\pmb{S}_i\}_{i=1}^{n_c}$  are the sensitivity maps of the receiver coils, and  $\Omega$  is the undersampling mask that indexes the sampled Fourier coefficients.

Dataset. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we use the fastMRI dataset (Zbontar et al., 2018), a benchmark dataset for evaluating deep-learning based MRI reconstruction methods. We use a subset of the multi-coil knee measurements of the fastMRI training set that consists of 49 patients (1,741 slices) for training, and 10 patients (370 slices) for testing, where each slice is of size  $80 \times 80$ . We select  $\Omega$  by generating Poisson-disc sampling masks using undersampling factors

$R = 2,4,8$  with a calibration region of  $16\times 16$  using the SigPy python package (Ong & Lustig, 2019). Sensitivity maps  $\pmb{S}_i$  are estimated using JSENSE (Ying & Sheng, 2007a).

Training. The multi-coil complex data are first undersampled, then reduced to a single-coil complex image using the SENSE model (Ying & Sheng, 2007b). The input of the networks are the real and imaginary components of this complex-valued Zero-Filled (ZF) image, where we wish to recover the fully-sampled ground-truth image. The real and imaginary components of each image are treated as separate examples during training. For the primal network, we use 1,024 filters, whereas for the dual network, we randomly sample 5,000 sign patterns.

Zero duality gap. We observe zero duality gap for CS-MRI, verifying Theorem 1. For different  $R$ , both the train and test loss of the primal and dual networks converge to the same optimal value, as depicted in Fig. 6. Furthermore, we show a representative axial slice from a random test patient in Fig. 7 reconstructed by the dual and primal networks, both achieving the same PSNR.

# 6 CONCLUSIONS

This paper puts forth a convex duality framework for CNN-based denoising networks. Focusing on a two-layer CNN network with ReLU activation, a convex dual program is formulated that offers optimal training using convex solvers, and gains more interpretability. It reveals that the weight decay regularization of CNNs induces path sparsity regularization for training, while the prediction is piece-wise linear filtering. The utility of the convex formulation for deeper networks is also discussed using greedy unrolling. There are other important next directions to pursue. One such direction pertains to stability analysis of the convex neural network for denoising, and more extensive evaluations with pathological medical images to highlight the crucial role of convexity for robustness.
