# ABSTRACT

End-to-end learning for visual robotic manipulation is known to suffer from sample inefficiency, requiring large numbers of demonstrations. The spatial roto-translation equivariance, or the  $SE(3)$ -equivariance can be exploited to improve the sample efficiency for learning robotic manipulation. In this paper, we present  $SE(3)$ -equivariant models for visual robotic manipulation from point clouds that can be trained fully end-to-end. By utilizing the representation theory of the Lie group, we construct novel  $SE(3)$ -equivariant energy-based models that allow highly sample efficient end-to-end learning. We show that our models can learn from scratch without prior knowledge and yet are highly sample efficient (5~10 demonstrations are enough). Furthermore, we show that our models can generalize to tasks with (i) previously unseen target object poses, (ii) previously unseen target object instances of the category, and (iii) previously unseen visual distractors. We experiment with 6-DoF robotic manipulation tasks to validate our models' sample efficiency and generalizability.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Learning robotic manipulation from scratch often involves learning from mistakes, making real-world applications highly impractical (Kalashnikov et al., 2018; Levine et al., 2016; Lee & Choi, 2022). Learning from demonstration (LfD) methods (Ravichandar et al., 2020; Argall et al., 2009) are advantageous because they do not involve trial and error, as only expert demonstrations are used for training. However, expert demonstrations are often rare and expensive to collect. Therefore in visual robotic manipulation, common practices include incorporating auxiliary pipelines such as pose estimation (Zeng et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2020), object segmentation (Simeonov et al., 2021), or pre-trained object representations (Simeonov et al., 2021; Florence et al., 2018; Kulkarni et al., 2019) to improve the sample efficiency of LfD algorithms. However, sufficient data for training such pipelines are often unavailable in practice. Therefore, visual robotic manipulation models that can be trained end-to-end from few demonstrations without additional data and pipelines are desirable.

Recently, group equivariant models have gained the spotlight for their sample efficiency in various domains, such as protein folding/docking and pose estimation tasks (Thomas et al., 2018; Fuchs et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021; Ganea et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021). In the robotic manipulation field, Transporter Networks (Zeng et al., 2020) achieved impressive sample efficiencies for visual end-to-end learning of planar tasks by exploiting the  $SE(2)$ -equivariance. However, these models cannot efficiently solve highly spatial tasks that require  $SE(3)$ -equivariance. Neural Descriptor Fields (NDFs) (Simeonov et al., 2021) have been proposed to incorporate full  $SE(3)$ -equivariance in robotic manipulation for sample efficiency. However, NDFs require excessive data (100,000 objects in the dataset) for the pre-training. In addition, NDFs require the target object point cloud to be well segmented from the background. These requirements are often impractical in practice. Therefore,  $SE(3)$ -equivariant models that can be trained with few demonstrations without requiring additional data could be highly desirable.

To this end, we present the first fully end-to-end  $SE(3)$ -equivariant models for visual robotic manipulation. We propose Equivariant Descriptor Fields (EDFs), which are the representation-theoretic generalizations to NDFs (Simeonov et al., 2021). We show that our models can be end-to-end trained

Figure 1: Given few  $(5\sim 10)$  demonstrations of a mug pick-and-place task, EDFs can be trained fully end-to-end without requiring any pre-training, object segmentation, or pose estimation pipelines. In addition, we show that EDFs can generalize to A) unseen poses, B) unseen instances of the target object category, and C) the presence of unseen visual distractors.

from only a few demonstrations (5~10 demonstrations are enough) without requiring any prior knowledge, such as pre-training or point cloud segmentation. Moreover, we show that our trained models can generalize to previously unseen out-of-distribution (OoD) poses, unseen instances (in the same object class) of the target objects, and the presence of unseen visual distractors (See Fig. 1). Our major contributions are as follows: (1) We propose the bi-equivariance condition of policy distributions in robotic manipulation tasks for sample efficiency and generalizability. (2) We construct novel representation-theoretic energy-based models that are bi-equivariant. (3) We provide effective sampling and training strategies for our unnormalized energy-based models on the  $SE(3)$  manifold.

# 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKS

# 2.1 EQUIVARIANT ROBOTIC MANIPULATION

Transporter Networks Transporter Networks and their variants (Zeng et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022; Seita et al., 2021) are  $SE(2)$ -equivariant end-to-end models for planar pick-and-place tasks. Transporter Networks use discretized group convolutions (Cohen & Welling, 2016) for the equivariance, which suffer from inaccuracy issues and the curse of dimensionality. It is prohibitively expensive to run group convolutions on the  $SE(3)$  manifold, which is 6-dimensional.  $SE(3)$  Transporter Networks (Zeng et al., 2020) regress the remaining non-planar degrees of freedom (height, roll, pitch) for spatial manipulation tasks. However, this approach is not fully  $SE(3)$ -equivariant, thus won't be sample efficient. In addition, the training often collapses when multimodal target distributions are given.

Neural Descriptor Fields Neural Descriptor Fields (NDFs) (Simeonov et al., 2021) are  $SE(3)$ -equivariant neural fields that are used as dense object descriptors (Florence et al., 2018) for robotic manipulations. NDFs can be used to learn highly spatial pick-and-place tasks with only a few demonstrations  $(5\sim 10)$ . Moreover, the trained model shows impressive generalization capabilities for the target objects of unseen poses and unseen instances. However, excessive data (a dataset of 100,000 objects, which amounts to  $150\mathrm{Gb}$ ) are required to pre-train NDFs. In addition, NDFs assume the point cloud input to be well segmented from the background. These two assumptions are highly non-trivial in practice.

# 2.2 SE(3)-EQUIVARIANT MODELS

SE(3)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks Graph neural networks are often used to model point cloud data (Wang et al., 2019; Te et al., 2018; Shi & Rajkumar, 2020).  $SE(3)$ -equivariant graph neural networks (Thomas et al., 2018; Fuchs et al., 2020) were proposed to exploit the rototranslation symmetry of graphs with spatial structures. In this work, we use tensor field networks (TFNs) (Thomas et al., 2018) and the  $SE(3)$ -transformers (Fuchs et al., 2020) as the backbone

networks for our equivariant models. We provide a detailed introduction to these networks in Appendix G.

SE(3)-Equivariant Energy-Based Models SE(3)-equivariant energy-based models (EBM) on spaces where the symmetry group acts on (e.g., Euclidean space or N-body systems) have been studied by Jaini et al. (2021); Wu et al. (2021). In this paper, we propose equivariant EBMs on the  $SE(3)$  manifold itself, which shall be distinguished from the spaces on which the group acts.

# 2.3 REPRESENTATION THEORY OF LIE GROUP

A representation  $\mathbf{D}$  of a group  $G$  is a map from  $G$  to the space of linear operators acting on a vector space  $\mathcal{V}$  that has the following property:

$$
\mathbf {D} (g) \mathbf {D} (h) = \mathbf {D} (g h) \quad \forall g, h \in G \tag {1}
$$

Two different representations  $\mathbf{D}$  and  $\mathbf{D}'$  are said to be of equivalence (Not to be confused with equivariance) if there exists a non-degenerate change of basis  $\mathbf{U}$  such that

$$
\mathbf {D} ^ {\prime} (g) = \mathbf {U D} (g) \mathbf {U} ^ {- 1} \quad \forall g \in G \tag {2}
$$

A representation is said to be reducible if there exists a change of basis such that the representation can be decomposed (block-diagonalized) into smaller subspaces. An irreducible representation is a representation that cannot be reduced anymore.

For the  $SO(3)$  group, any representation  $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{R})$  for  $\mathbf{R}\in SO(3)$  can be reduced into a direct sum of  $(2l + 1)\times (2l + 1)$  dimensional irreducible representations  $\mathbf{D}_l(\mathbf{R})$  of degree  $l\in \{0,1,2,\dots \}$  such that

$$
\mathbf {D} (\mathbf {R}) = \mathbf {U} \left[ \bigoplus_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \mathbf {D} _ {l _ {n}} (\mathbf {R}) \right] \mathbf {U} ^ {- 1} \quad \forall \mathbf {R} \in S O (3) \tag {3}
$$

where  $\bigoplus$  denotes a direct sum<sup>1</sup>. Although there are infinitely many equivalent representations for such  $\mathbf{D}_l$ , a particularly preferred choice is one with a real basis<sup>2</sup>. In this basis, all the representations  $\mathbf{D}_l$  are orthogonal matrices. These matrices are called the (real) Wigner  $D$ -matrices (Aubert, 2013; Fuchs et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2018). The  $(2l + 1)$  dimensional vectors that are transformed by  $\mathbf{D}_l(\mathbf{R})$  are called type- $l$  (or spin- $l$ ) vectors. Type- $l$  vectors are identical to themselves when they are rotated by  $\theta = 2\pi / l$ . Type-0 vectors, or scalars are invariant to rotations ( $\theta = \infty$ ). Type-1 vectors are the familiar 3-dimensional space vectors ( $\theta = 2\pi$ ).

Let  $\mathcal{V}$  be a vector space and  $\mathcal{X}$  and  $\mathcal{Y}$  be sets with a group action  $\circ$  such that  $g\circ (h\circ X) = (gh)\circ X$  and  $g\circ (h\circ Y) = (gh)\circ Y$ $\forall g,h\in G,X\in \mathcal{X},Y\in \mathcal{Y}$ . A map  $\mathbf{f}(X|Y):\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}\to \mathcal{V}$  is said to be  $G$ -equivariant if

$$
\mathbf {D} _ {\mathcal {V}} (g) \mathbf {f} (X | Y) = \mathbf {f} (g \circ X | g \circ Y) \quad \forall g \in G, X \in \mathcal {X}, Y \in \mathcal {Y} \tag {4}
$$

where  $\mathbf{D}_{\mathcal{V}}$  is a representation of  $G$  acting on  $\mathcal{V}$ . In the special case where  $\mathbf{D}_{\mathcal{V}} = \mathbf{I}$ , the map  $\mathbf{f}(X|Y)$  is said to be  $G$ -invariant.

A translation invariant and  $SO(3)$ -equivariant type- $l$  vector field, or simply an  $SE(3)$ -equivariant type- $l$  vector field,  $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}|X): \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^{2l+1}$  is a special case of  $SE(3)$ -equivariant map such that

$$
\mathbf {D} _ {l} (\mathbf {R}) \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {x} | X) = \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {R} \mathbf {x} + \mathbf {v} | T \circ X) \quad \forall T = (\mathbf {R}, \mathbf {v}) \in S E (3) \tag {5}
$$

where  $\mathbf{R} \in SO(3)$ ,  $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^3$  and  $T \circ \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{v}$ . From now on, we simply denote the action of  $T \in SE(3)$  on  $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3$  as  $T\mathbf{x}$  instead of  $T \circ \mathbf{x}$  for brevity. A detailed recipe for constructing such  $SE(3)$ -equivariant vector fields when  $X \in \mathcal{X}$  is given as a graph is described in Appendix G.

# 3 PROBLEM FORMULATION

Let a colored point cloud with  $M$  points given by  $X = \{(\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{c}_1),\dots ,(\mathbf{x}_M,\mathbf{c}_M)\} \in \mathcal{P}$  where  $\mathbf{x}_i\in \mathbb{R}^3$  is the position,  $\mathbf{c}_i\in \mathbb{R}^3$  is the color vector of the  $i$ -th point, and  $\mathcal{P}$  is the set of all possible

colored point clouds. Note that  $M$  may vary for different point clouds. Since the color vector  $\mathbf{c}_i$  is the direct sum of three type-0 features (red, green, and blue), it is invariant under rigid body transformations. On the other hand, the position vector  $\mathbf{x}_i$  transforms like a type-1 vector such that  $T\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{v}$ . Therefore, we define the group action  $\circ : SE(3) \times \mathcal{P} \to \mathcal{P}$  as

$$
T \circ X = \left\{\left(T \mathbf {x} _ {1}, \mathbf {c} _ {1}\right), \left(T \mathbf {x} _ {2}, \mathbf {c} _ {2}\right), \dots , \left(T \mathbf {x} _ {M}, \mathbf {c} _ {M}\right) \right\} \quad \forall T = (\mathbf {R}, \mathbf {v}) \in S E (3) \tag {6}
$$

We now define the bi-equivariance of a probability distribution and a scalar function on the  $SE(3)$  manifold conditioned by two point clouds,  $X$  and  $Y$ .

Definition 1. A differential probability distribution  $dP(T|X,Y)$  on  $SE(3)$  conditioned by two point clouds  $X,Y\in \mathcal{P}$  is bi-equivariant if for all Borel subsets  $\Omega \subseteq SE(3)$ ,

$$
\int_ {T \in \Omega} d P (T | X, Y) = \int_ {T \in S \Omega} d P (T | S \circ X, Y) = \int_ {T \in \Omega S} d P (T | X, S ^ {- 1} \circ Y) \quad \forall S \in S E (3) \tag {7}
$$

where  $S\Omega = \{ST|T\in \Omega \}$ ,  $\Omega S = \{TS|T\in \Omega \}$ , and  $S^{-1}$  denotes the group inverse of  $S$ .

Definition 2. A scalar function  $f: SE(3) \times \mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{P} \to \mathbb{R}$  is bi-equivariant if

$$
f (T | X, Y) = f \left(S T | S \circ X, Y\right) = f \left(T S | X, S ^ {- 1} \circ Y\right) \quad \forall S \in S E (3) \tag {8}
$$

Proposition 1. A probability distribution  $dP(T|X,Y)$  is bi-equivariant if

$$
d P (T | X, Y) = P (T | X, Y) d T \tag {9}
$$

where  $dT$  is the bi-invariant volume form (See Appendix A) on the  $SE(3)$  manifold and  $P(T|X,Y)$  is a bi-equivariant probability density function (PDF).

We provide the proof of Proposition 1 in Appendix F.1. Note that the bi-equivariance condition in Definition 1 can be understood as the probabilistic generalization to the  $SE(3)$ -equivariance constraints in Ganea et al. (2021).

Now consider a manipulation task where the point cloud of the scene is given by  $X \in \mathcal{P}$ , and the point cloud of the end-effector (and the grasped object, if any) is given by  $Y \in \mathcal{P}$ . The end-effector pose can be represented as  $T \in SE(3)$ . The inherent  $SE(3)$ -symmetry of the task can be exploited by restricting the policy distribution  $dP(T|X,Y)$  to be bi-equivariant. By Proposition 1, our goal is then to construct a bi-equivariant PDF  $P(T|X,Y)$  such that

$$
P (T | X, Y) = P (S T | S \circ X, Y) = P (T S | X, S ^ {- 1} \circ Y) \quad \forall S \in S E (3) \tag {10}
$$

The intuitive explanation of Equation (10) in robotic manipulation is provided in Appendix C.

There is one caveat, however, in applying Equation (10) to our problem. We want the distribution of the grasp pose to be equivariant only to the target object and not the background scene. That is, we want our models to be locally equivariant to the target object. Unfortunately, Equation (10) only guarantees the global equivariance, namely that the model is equivariant only when the target object and the background transform together. We illustrate the local equivariance and the global equivariance in Figure 2.

To achieve the local equivariance, not every equivariant model but the ones that only rely on locally equivariant operations should be used. For example, NDFs (Simeonov et al., 2021) use the centroid subtraction method to achieve translational equivariance. However, centroid subtraction is a highly non-local operation. For an unsegmented input, the centroid is dominated by the background, not the target object. As a result, NDFs can only be used for well-segmented point clouds. On the other hand, Transporter Networks (Zeng et al., 2020) use convolutional neural networks to achieve translational equivariance. Convolutional neural networks are well known for their local translational equivariance (Battaglia et al., 2018; Goodfellow et al., 2016). Therefore, Transporter networks accept unsegmented inputs. Inspired by the success of Transporter Networks, we also took special care in designing our models to be locally  $SE(3)$ -equivariant by only adopting local mechanisms. The specific choice of the models can be found in Section 4.3.

# 4 BI-EQUIVARIANT ENERGY BASED MODELS ON SE(3)

In this section, we present EDFs and the corresponding bi-equivariant energy-based models on  $SE(3)$ . EDFs are the representation-theoretic generalizations of NDFs (Simeonov et al., 2021). In the context of the representation theory of the Lie group, NDFs are invariant (type-0) descriptor fields, which are the special cases of EDFs. We illustrate our method in Fig. 3.

# 4.1 EQUIVARIANT DESCRIPTOR FIELD

We define the EDF  $\varphi (\mathbf{x}|X)$  as a direct sum of  $N$  vector fields

$$
\varphi (\mathbf {x} | X) = \bigoplus_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \varphi^ {(n)} (\mathbf {x} | X) \tag {11}
$$

where  $\varphi^{(n)}(\mathbf{x}|X):\mathbb{R}^3\times \mathcal{P}\to \mathbb{R}^{2l_n + 1}$  is an  $SE(3)$ -equivariant type- $l_{n}$  vector field. Therefore, the EDF  $\varphi (\mathbf{x}|X)$  transforms according to a rigid body transformation  $T\in SE(3)$  as

$$
\varphi (T \mathbf {x} | T \circ X) = \mathbf {D} (\mathbf {R}) \varphi (\mathbf {x} | X) \quad \forall T \in S E (3) \tag {12}
$$

where  $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{R}) = \bigoplus_{n=1}^{N} \mathbf{D}_{l_n}(\mathbf{R})$  is the direct sum of the Wigner D-Matrices of degree  $l_n$  in the real basis, which is an orthogonal representation of the  $SO(3)$  group:

$$
\mathbf {D} (\mathbf {R}) ^ {T} = \mathbf {D} (\mathbf {R}) ^ {- 1} = \mathbf {D} \left(\mathbf {R} ^ {- 1}\right) = \mathbf {D} \left(\mathbf {R} ^ {T}\right) \tag {13}
$$

Note that the NDFs (Simeonov et al., 2021) can be understood as the special cases of the EDFs whose components are all type-0 vectors (invariant scalars) such that  $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{R}) = \mathbf{I}$ .

# 4.2 EQUIVARIANT ENERGY-BASED MODEL ON SE(3)

An energy-based model on the  $SE(3)$  manifold conditioned by  $X, Y \in \mathcal{P}$  can be defined as

$$
P (T | X, Y) = \frac {\exp [ - E (T | X , Y) ]}{\int_ {S E (3)} d T \exp [ - E (T | X , Y) ]} \tag {14}
$$

Proposition 2. The EBM  $P(T|X,Y)$  in Equation (14) is bi-equivariant if the energy function  $E(T|X,Y)$  is bi-equivariant.

We prove Proposition 2 in Appendix F.2. We now propose the following energy function:

$$
E (T | X, Y) = \int_ {\mathbb {R} ^ {3}} d ^ {3} \mathbf {x} \rho (\mathbf {x} | Y) \| \boldsymbol {\varphi} (T \mathbf {x} | X) - \mathbf {D} (\mathbf {R}) \boldsymbol {\psi} (\mathbf {x} | Y) \| ^ {2} \tag {15}
$$

where  $\varphi (\mathbf{x}|X)$  is the key EDF,  $\psi (\mathbf{x}|Y)$  is the query EDF, and  $\rho (\mathbf{x}|Y)$  is the query density. The query density is an  $SE(3)$ -equivariant non-negative scalar field such that  $\rho (\mathbf{x}|Y) = \rho (T\mathbf{x}|T\circ Y)$ . Intuitively, the energy function in Equation (15) can be thought as a query-key matching between the key EDF and the query EDF which is analogous to (Zeng et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022).

Proposition 3. The energy function  $E(T|X,Y)$  in Equation (15) is bi-equivariant.

We prove Proposition 3 in Appendix F.3. As a result, the EBM in Equation (14) with the energy function in Equation (15) is also bi-equivariant.

# 4.3 IMPLEMENTATION

Our method consists of two models, viz. the pick-model and the place-model. The pick-model is a simplified version of the place-model. Therefore, we only demonstrate here the components of the place-model. The pick-model is demonstrated in Appendix E. We show in Appendix E that the energy function used in Simeonov et al. (2021) is a special case of the pick-model's energy function.

Figure 3: A) Query points and query EDF are generated from the point cloud of the grasp. Query EDF values at the query points are used as the query descriptors. We visualized three type-0 descriptors in colors (RGB) and type-1 descriptors as arrows. We only visualized type-1 descriptors in important locations. We did not visualize higher-type descriptors. B) The key descriptors are generated from the point cloud of the scene. C) The query descriptors are transformed and matched to the key descriptors to produce the energy of the pose. For simplicity, we only visualized the query descriptor for a single query point. Note that the query and key descriptors are better aligned in the low energy case than in the high energy case for both the type-0 and type-1 descriptors (The orange query points are near the orange region, and the black arrow is well aligned to the gray arrows).

![](images/fde2e26972a4d50453d3810a8a8377c056964dc47bd1f0bf6ca48182764ab963.jpg)

For the following sections, we denote all the learnable parameters as  $\theta$ . Therefore, all the functions with  $\theta$  as a subscript are to be understood as trainable models.

Query Density We now illustrate our particular choice of the query density model. To make the integral in Equation (15) tractable, we design the query density to be the weighted sum of Dirac delta functions

$$
\rho_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} | Y) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {q}} w _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\mathbf {q} _ {i; \boldsymbol {\theta}} (Y) | Y\right) \delta^ {(3)} \left(\mathbf {x} - \mathbf {q} _ {i; \boldsymbol {\theta}} (Y)\right) \tag {16}
$$

where  $\mathbf{q}_{i;\pmb{\theta}}(Y):\mathcal{P}\to \mathbb{R}^3$  is the  $i$ -th query point function and  $w_{\pmb{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|Y):\mathbb{R}^3\times \mathcal{P}\to \mathbb{R}^+$  is the query weight field. These maps are  $SE(3)$ -equivariant such that

$$
\mathbf {q} _ {i; \boldsymbol {\theta}} (T \circ Y) = T \mathbf {q} _ {i; \boldsymbol {\theta}} (Y)
$$

$$
w _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (T \mathbf {x} | T \circ Y) = w _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} | Y)
$$

Proposition 4. The query density  $\rho_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}|Y)$  in Equation (16) is  $SE(3)$ -equivariant.

We prove Proposition 4 in Appendix F.4. In this case, the integral in Equation (15) can be written in the following tractable summation form:

$$
E _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (T | X, Y) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {q}} \widetilde {E} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (T | X, Y, w _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {q} _ {i; \theta} (Y) | Y), \mathbf {q} _ {i; \theta} (Y)) \tag {18}
$$

$$
\widetilde {E} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (T | X, Y, w, \mathbf {q}) = w \| \varphi_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (T \mathbf {q} | X) - \mathbf {D} (\mathbf {R}) \psi_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {q} | Y) \| ^ {2} \tag {19}
$$

The implementation details for  $\mathbf{q}_{i;\pmb{\theta}}(Y)$  and  $w_{\pmb{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|Y)$  are provided in Appendix B.

EDFs As was argued in Section 3, only the local operations should be used in our models for the local equivariance. We use Tensor Field Networks (TFNs) (Thomas et al., 2018) and SE(3)-Transformers (Fuchs et al., 2020) as backbone networks for our models. The convolution operations that are used in these networks are highly local when their radial functions (See Appendix G) have short cutoff distances. We used simple radius clustering to make the point clouds into graphs. Note that the radius clustering is  $SE(3)$ -equivariant and local within the clustering radius. We use the E3NN package (Geiger et al., 2022) to implement the equivariant layers. We visualized the key EDF of a trained pick-model in Figure 4.

Figure 4: The key EDF of a trained pick-model is illustrated for the scenes with a mug in A) upright pose and B) lying pose. Note that the colors (type-0 descriptors) are invariant to the rotation of the mug. On the other hand, the arrows (type-1 descriptors) are equivariant to the rotation. We only visualized type-1 descriptors in important locations. Higher-type descriptors are not visualized.

# 5 SAMPLING AND TRAINING

The gradient of the log-likelihood cannot be directly calculated for a typical EBM due to the intractable integral in the denominator. Therefore, a common practice is to draw negative samples from the EBM using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and then estimate the gradient of the log of the denominator using the negative samples (Hinton, 2002; Carreira-Perpinan & Hinton, 2005; Du & Mordatch, 2019; Florence et al., 2022). However, commonly used MCMC methods on Euclidean spaces cannot be used to sample from our EBMs due to the differential geometric complications of the  $SE(3)$  manifold. We explain the methods that we used to sample from our EBM in Appendix D.

We now explain the training methods that we used. For the energy-based model in Equation (14), the gradient of the log-likelihood can be estimated as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \log P _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(T _ {t a r g e t} | X, Y\right) = - \nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} E _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(T _ {t a r g e t} | X, Y\right) + \mathbb {E} _ {P (T | X, Y)} \left[ \nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} E _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (T | X, Y) \right] \\ \approx - \nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} E _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(T _ {t a r g e t} | X, Y\right) + \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \left[ \nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} E _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(T _ {n} | X, Y\right) \right] \tag {20} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $T_{target}$  is the target pose, and  $T_{n} \sim P(T|X,Y)$  is  $n$ -th negative sample (Carreira-Perpinan & Hinton, 2005).

However, we found that directly maximizing the log-likelihood is highly unstable because of the initial mismatch between the two EDFs in Equation (19). To illustrate this, let the i-th query point be  $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{q}_{i:\theta}(Y)$ . When the two EDFs are initialized such that  $\varphi_{\theta}(T_{target}\mathbf{q}|X)$  and  $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{R}_{target})\psi_{\theta}(\mathbf{q}|Y)$  are largely different, the learning algorithm tends to lower the weight  $w_{\theta}(\mathbf{q}|Y)$ . This leads to the query point being ignored even if it is actually important. Furthermore, the learning algorithm would move future query points away from  $\mathbf{q}$ . These tendencies result in all the query points in essential locations (such as contact points) being ignored or pushed away. As a result, the training diverges. To avoid this instability, we propose using the following surrogate query model during the early stage of training.

We first decompose the EBM  $P(T|X,Y)$  induced by the energy function in Equation (18) into

$$
P (T | X, Y) = \int d \mathbf {w} \int d \mathbf {Q} P (T | X, Y, \mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q}) P (\mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q} | Y) \tag {21}
$$

$$
P (T | X, Y, \mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q}) = \frac {\exp \left[ - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {q}} \widetilde {E} (T | X , Y , w _ {i} , \mathbf {q} _ {i}) \right]}{\int_ {S E (3)} d T \exp \left[ - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {q}} \widetilde {E} (T | X , Y , w _ {i} , \mathbf {q} _ {i}) \right]} \tag {22}
$$

$$
P (\mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q} | Y) = \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {q}} P _ {i} (w _ {i}, \mathbf {q} _ {i} | Y) = \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {q}} \left[ \delta (w _ {i} - w (\mathbf {q} _ {i} | Y)) \times \delta^ {(3)} (\mathbf {q} _ {i} - \mathbf {q} _ {i} (Y)) \right] \tag {23}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Q} = (\mathbf{q}_1,\dots ,\mathbf{q}_{N_q})$  and  $\mathbf{w} = (w_{1},\dots ,w_{N_{q}})$ . We temporarily hide  $\pmb{\theta}$  for brevity.

Proposition 5. The marginal EBM  $P(T|X,Y)$  in Equation (21) is bi-equivariant if

$$
P (\mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q} | Y) = P (\mathbf {w}, S \mathbf {Q} | S \circ Y) \forall S \in S E (3)
$$

We prove Proposition 5 in Appendix F.5. We now relax this deterministic query model into a stochastic model by adding Gaussian noise to the logits of the query weights  $l_{i} = \log w_{i}$  as follows.

$$
\hat {P} (\mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q} | Y) = \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {q}} \hat {P} _ {i} (w _ {i}, \mathbf {q} _ {i} | Y) = \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {q}} \frac {d l _ {i}}{d w _ {i}} \mathcal {N} \left(l _ {i}; \log w \left(\mathbf {q} _ {i} | Y\right), \sigma_ {H}\right) \delta^ {(3)} \left(\mathbf {q} _ {i} - \mathbf {q} _ {i} (Y)\right) \tag {24}
$$

Now we propose the following surrogate query model

$$
H (\mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q} | X, Y, T) = \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {q}} H _ {i} \left(w _ {i}, \mathbf {q} _ {i} | X, Y, T\right) \tag {25}
$$

$$
H _ {i} (w _ {i}, \mathbf {q} _ {i} | X, Y, T) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \hat {P} _ {i} (w _ {i}, \mathbf {q} _ {i} | Y) & \text {i f} d \\ (d l _ {i} / d w _ {i}) \mathcal {N} (l _ {i}; \alpha , \sigma_ {H}) \delta^ {(3)} (\mathbf {q} _ {i} - \mathbf {q} _ {i} (Y)) & \text {e l s e} \end{array} \right.
$$

where  $\sigma_H \in \mathbb{R}^+$ ,  $r \in \mathbb{R}^+$ , and  $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$  are hyperparameters and  $d_{min}(\mathbf{x}, X): \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathcal{P} \to \mathbb{R}^+$  is the shortest Euclidean distance between  $\mathbf{x}$  and the points in  $X$ . We set  $\alpha$  to be sufficiently small so that query points without neighboring points in  $X$  can be suppressed.

To train our models using the surrogate query model in Equation (25), we maximize the following variational lower bound (Kingma & Welling, 2013) instead of the marginal log-likelihood.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {L} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (T | X, Y) = \mathbb {E} _ {\mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q} \sim H _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}}} \left[ \log P _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (T | X, Y, \mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q}) \right] \\ - D _ {K L} \left[ H _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q} | X, Y, T) \left\| \hat {P} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {w}, \mathbf {Q} | Y) \right. \right] \tag {26} \\ \end{array}
$$

Proposition 6. The variational lower bound  $\mathcal{L}_{\theta}(T|X,Y)$  in Equation (26) is bi-equivariant.

We provide the proof of Proposition 6 in Appendix F.6. The Kullback-Leibler divergence term in Equation (26) is provided in Appendix B.3. Once the query model has been sufficiently trained, we remove the surrogate query model and return to the maximum likelihood training in Equation (20).

# 6 EXPERIMENT RESULTS

We designed the experiments to assess the impact of representation-theoretic  $SE(3)$ -equivariance on the generalization performance. To show this, we compare our method (fully  $SE(3)$ -equivariant) against an  $SE(2)$ -equivariant method and an  $SE(3)$ -invariant method. For the  $SE(2)$ -equivariant method, we use  $SE(3)$  Transporter Networks ( $SE(3)$ -TNs). For the  $SE(3)$ -invariant method, we propose the invariant descriptor fields (IDFs), which are the special case of EDFs with all the descriptors being type-0 (Note that invariance is a special case of equivariance). IDFs can be understood as the end-to-end trainable version of NDFs (See Appendix E). We evaluate the generalizability of the models with three criteria: 1) generalization to unseen poses, 2) generalization to unseen instances, and 3) robustness to unseen visual distractors. We evaluate these criteria in a mug hanging task as Simeonov et al. (2021), where a mug should be picked by its rim and then hung on a hanger by its handle. The experiment results are summarized in Table 1. On average, it took 4.72 seconds to infer pick and 8.33 seconds to infer place on our system. Detailed experimental setups are provided in Appendix H.

We trained the models with ten demonstrations that were randomly generated by a probabilistic oracle with two modalities: the oracle picks the left side of the rim with a  $50\%$  chance. It picks the opposite side for the rest of the cases. Only a single identical mug with upright poses is used in the demonstrations. However, we found that the  $SE(3)$ -TNs struggle with the high variance and multimodality of the demonstrations. Therefore, we trained  $SE(3)$ -TNs using alternative task demonstrations generated by a low-variance unimodal oracle. For a fair comparison, we also provide results for EDFs trained with the same task demonstrations in Table 3 of Appendix I. The experiment results for EDFs trained with five demonstrations are also provided in Table 3 of Appendix I.

We also assess the robustness of our method to the significant multimodality in the task demonstrations. To show this, we experiment with highly inconsistent demonstrations in which the rim and handle grasps are both used. Lastly, we experiment with another task to verify that our method can be applied to tasks other than the mug hanging task. We evaluate with a stick-to-tray task, in which a stick is picked and then placed onto a tray. We provide detailed setups in Appendix H. We provide the total success rate of these tasks in Table 2. Full results can be found in Table 4 of Appendix I.

Analysis As can be seen in Table 1, all the methods are highly capable of solving the default task. However, the generalization capabilities vary greatly by the methods.  $SE(3)$ -TNs completely fail to generalize to unseen poses, which was expected as they lack the  $SE(3)$ -equivariance. Interestingly, it turns out that the  $SE(3)$ -equivariant methods (IDFs and EDFs) also outperform  $SE(3)$ -TNs in other types of generalizations. We found that EDFs are superior to IDF's for all types of generalizations, although the margins are small. However, when the unseen poses, instances, and distractors are combined, EDFs significantly outperform IDF's with nearly five times fewer failures. We presume this is because  $SE(3)$ -invariant descriptors (type-0) cannot encode orientational information by themselves. As a result, all orientational information should be con

veyed through the position of the query points. Therefore, IDFs fail to infer orientation correctly when query points are poorly generated. On the other hand, the higher-type descriptors can themselves encode orientational information. Therefore, EDFs are robust to low-quality query points. Figure 5 shows the failure cases of  $SE(3)$ -TNs and IDFs. Lastly, Table 2 supports that our energy-based method is provably robust to highly inconsistent and multimodal demonstrations. In addition, it shows that our method can be used for other tasks besides the mug-hanging task.

# 7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

There are several limitations to EDFs that should be resolved in future works. First, while our method can infer pick-and-place poses in a reasonable time, faster sampling methods are required for real-time manipulations. In addition, EDFs are not intended for tasks with significant occlusions to the target object. Future work may also encompass some 3D reconstruction methods. Lastly, EDFs cannot solve problems at the trajectory level, which is a shared problem with NDFs. Future work should define the adequate equivariance condition for full trajectory-level manipulation tasks.

To summarize, we introduce EDFs and the corresponding energy-based models, which are  $SE(3)$ -equivariant end-to-end models for robotic manipulations. We propose novel bi-equivariant energy-based models, which provably allow highly sample efficient and generalizable learning. Finally, we show by experiment that 1) our method is highly sample efficient and generalizable, 2) our method is robust to inconsistency and multimodality in the demonstrations, and 3) higher-degree equivariance (type1 or higher) is important for generalizability.

Reproducibility Statement We submit all the codes that are required to reproduce the results of every experiment in this paper. We have verified that all the results are perfectly reproducible in our local machine. However, the results may not be exactly reproduced in different machines because of the numerical imprecision. Due to the MCMC algorithms, even very small numerical differences may accumulate to result in completely different outputs. Therefore, we also submit the download links to training checkpoints and demonstration files for reproducibility across different machines.
