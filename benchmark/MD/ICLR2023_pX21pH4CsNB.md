# ABSTRACT

While modern machine learning models rely on increasingly large training datasets, data is often limited in privacy-sensitive domains. Generative models trained with differential privacy (DP) on sensitive data can sidestep this challenge, providing access to synthetic data instead. However, training DP generative models is highly challenging due to the noise injected into training to enforce DP. We propose to leverage diffusion models (DMs), an emerging class of deep generative models, and introduce Differentially Private Diffusion Models (DPDMs), which enforce privacy using differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). We motivate why DP-SGD is well suited for training DPDMs, and thoroughly investigate the DM parameterization and the sampling algorithm, which turn out to be crucial ingredients in DPDMs. Furthermore, we propose noise multiplicity, a simple yet powerful modification of the DM training objective tailored to the DP setting to boost performance. We validate our novel DPDMs on widely-used image generation benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance by large margins. For example, on MNIST we improve the SOTA FID from 48.4 to 5.01 and downstream classification accuracy from  $83.2\%$  to  $98.1\%$  for the privacy setting  $\mathrm{DP - (\varepsilon = 10,\delta = 10^{-5})}$ . Moreover, on standard benchmarks, classifiers trained on DPDM-generated synthetic data perform on par with task-specific DP-SGD-trained classifiers, which has not been demonstrated before for DP generative models.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Modern deep learning usually requires significant amounts of training data. However, sourcing large datasets in privacy-sensitive domains is often difficult. To circumvent this challenge, generative models trained on sensitive data can provide access to large synthetic data instead, which can be used flexibly to train downstream models. Unfortunately, typical overparameterized neural networks have been shown to provide little to no privacy to the data they have been trained on. For example, an adversary may be able to recover training images of deep classifiers using gradients of the networks (Yin et al., 2021) or reproduce training text sequences from large transformers (Carlini et al., 2021). Generative models may even overfit directly, generating data indistinguishable from the data they have been trained on. In fact, overfitting and privacy-leakage of generative models are more relevant than ever, considering recent works that train powerful photo-realistic image generators on large-scale Internet-scraped data (Rombach et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022).

To protect the privacy of training data, one may train their model using differential privacy (DP). DP is a rigorous privacy framework that applies to statistical queries (Dwork et al., 2006; 2014). In our case, this query corresponds to the training of a neural network using sensitive data. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) (Abadi et al., 2016) is the workhorse of DP training of neural networks. It preserves privacy by clipping and noising the parameter gradients during training. This leads to an inevitable trade-off between privacy and utility; for instance, small clipping constants and large noise injection result in very private models that may be of little practical use.

DP-SGD has, for example, been employed to train generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Frigerio et al., 2019; Torkzadehmahani et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018), which are particularly susceptible to privacy-leakage (Webster et al., 2021). However, while GANs in the non-private setting can synthesize photo-realistic images (Brock et al., 2019; Karras et al., 2020b;a; 2021), their application in the private setting is challenging. GANs are difficult to optimize (Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017; Mescheder et al., 2018) and prone to mode collapse; both phenomena may be amplified during DP-SGD training.

Recently, Diffusion Models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative models (Song et al., 2021c; Ho et al., 2020; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015), demonstrating outstanding performance

Figure 1: Information flow during training in our Differentially Private Diffusion Model (DPDM) for a single training sample in green (i.e. batchsize  $B = 1$ , another sample shown in blue). We rely on DP-SGD to guarantee privacy and use noise multiplicity; here,  $K = 3$ . The diffusion is visualized for a one-dim. toy distribution (marginal probabilities in purple); our main experiments use high-dim. images. Note that for brevity in the visualization we dropped the index  $i$ , which indicates the minibatch element in Eqs. (6) and (7).

in image synthesis (Ho et al., 2021; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Rombach et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2022; Sahara et al., 2022). In DMs, a diffusion process gradually perturbs the data towards random noise, while a deep neural network learns to denoise. DMs stand out not only by high synthesis quality, but also sample diversity, and a simple and robust training objective. This makes them arguably well suited for training under DP perturbations. Moreover, generation in DMs corresponds to an iterative denoising process, breaking the difficult generation task into many small denoising steps that are individually simpler than the one-shot synthesis task performed by GANs and other traditional methods. In particular, the denoising neural network that is learnt in DMs and applied repeatedly at each synthesis step is less complex and smoother than the generator networks of one-shot methods, as we validate in experiments on toy data. Therefore, training of the denoising neural network is arguably less sensitive to gradient clipping and noise injection required for DP.

Based on these observations, we propose Differentially Private Diffusion Models (DPDMs), DMs trained with rigorous DP guarantees based on DP-SGD. We thoroughly study the DM parameterization and sampling algorithm, and tailor them to the DP setting. We find that the stochasticity in DM sampling, which is empirically known to be error-correcting (Karras et al., 2022), can be particularly helpful in DP-SGD training to obtain satisfactory perceptual output quality. We also propose noise multiplicity, where a single training data sample is re-used for training at multiple perturbation levels along the diffusion process (see Fig. 1). This simple yet powerful modification of the DM training objective improves learning at no additional privacy cost. We validate DPDMs on standard DP image generation tasks, and achieve state-of-the-art performance by large margins, both in terms of perceptual quality and performance of downstream classifiers trained on synthetically generated data from our models. For example, on MNIST we improve the state-of-the-art FID from 48.4 to 5.01 and downstream classification accuracy from  $83.2\%$  to  $98.1\%$  for the privacy setting DP-  $(\varepsilon = 10,\delta = 10^{-5})$ . We also find that classifiers trained on DPDM-generated synthetic data perform on par with task-specific DP-trained classifiers on standard benchmarks, which has not been demonstrated before for DP generative models.

In summary, we make the following contributions: (i) We carefully motivate training DMs with DP-SGD and introduce DPDMs, the first DMs trained under DP guarantees. (ii) We study DPDM parameterization, training setting and sampling in detail, and optimize it for the DP setup. (iii) We propose noise multiplicity to efficiently boost DPDM performance. (iv) Experimentally, we significantly surpass the state-of-the-art in DP synthesis on widely-studied image modeling benchmarks. (v) We demonstrate that classifiers trained on DPDM-generated data perform on par with task-specific DP-trained discriminative models. This implies a very high utility of the synthetic data generated by DPDMs, delivering on the promise of DP generative models as an effective data sharing medium. Finally, we hope that our work has implications for the literature on DMs, which are now routinely trained on ultra large-scale datasets of diverse origins.

# 2 BACKGROUND

# 2.1 DIFFUSION MODELS

We consider continuous-time DMs (Song et al., 2021c) and follow the presentation of Karras et al. (2022). Let  $p_{\mathrm{data}}(\mathbf{x})$  denote the data distribution and  $p(\mathbf{x};\sigma)$  the distribution obtained by adding i.i.d.

$\sigma^2$ -variance Gaussian noise to the data distribution. For sufficiently large  $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}$ ,  $p(\mathbf{x};\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$  is almost indistinguishable from  $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^2$ -variance Gaussian noise. Capitalizing on this observation, DMs sample (high variance) Gaussian noise  $\mathbf{x}_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$  and sequentially denoise  $\mathbf{x}_0$  into  $\mathbf{x}_i \sim p(\mathbf{x}_i;\sigma_i)$ ,  $i \in [0,\dots,M]$ , with  $\sigma_i < \sigma_{i-1}$  ( $\sigma_0 = \sigma_{\mathrm{max}}$ ). If  $\sigma_M = 0$ , then  $\mathbf{x}_0$  is distributed according to the data.

Sampling. In practice, the sequential denoising is often implemented through the simulation of the Probability Flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) (Song et al., 2021c)

$$
d \mathbf {x} = - \dot {\sigma} (t) \sigma (t) \nabla_ {\mathbf {x}} \log p (\mathbf {x}; \sigma (t)) d t, \tag {1}
$$

where  $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log p(\mathbf{x};\sigma)$  is the score function (Hyvarinen, 2005). The schedule  $\sigma (t):[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}_{+}$  is user-specified and  $\dot{\sigma} (t)$  denotes the time derivative of  $\sigma (t)$ . Alternatively, we may also sample from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) (Song et al., 2021c; Karras et al., 2022):

$$
d \mathbf {x} = \underbrace {- \dot {\sigma} (t) \sigma (t) \nabla_ {\mathbf {x}} \log p (\mathbf {x} ; \sigma (t)) d t} _ {\text {P r o b a b i l i t y F l o w O D E ; s e e E q . (1)}} - \underbrace {\beta (t) \sigma^ {2} (t) \nabla_ {\mathbf {x}} \log p (\mathbf {x} ; \sigma (t)) d t + \sqrt {2 \beta (t)} \sigma (t) d \omega_ {t}} _ {\text {L a n g e v i n d i f f u s i o n c o m p o n e n t}}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $d\omega_{t}$  is the standard Wiener process. In principle, given initial samples  $\mathbf{x}_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$ , simulating either Probability Flow ODE or SDE produces samples from the same distribution. In practice, though, neither ODE nor SDE can be simulated exactly: Firstly, any numerical solver inevitably introduces discretization errors. Secondly, the score function is only accessible through a model  $s_\theta(\mathbf{x}; \sigma)$  that needs to be learned; replacing the score function with an imperfect model also introduces an error. Empirically, the ODE formulation has been used frequently to develop fast solvers (Song et al., 2021a; Zhang & Chen, 2022; Lu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022), whereas the SDE formulation often leads to higher quality samples (while requiring more steps) (Karras et al., 2022). One possible explanation for the latter observation is that the Langevin diffusion component in the SDE at any time during the synthesis process actively drives the process towards the desired marginal distribution  $p(\mathbf{x}; \sigma)$ , whereas errors accumulate in the ODE formulation, even when using many synthesis steps. In fact, it has been shown that as the score model  $s_\theta$  improves, the performance boost that can be obtained by an SDE solver diminishes (Karras et al., 2022). Finally, note that we are using classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2021) to perform class-conditional sampling in this work. For details on classifier-free guidance and the numerical solvers for Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), we refer to App. C.3.

Training. DM training reduces to learning the score model  $s_{\theta}$ . The model can, for example, be parameterized as  $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log p(\mathbf{x};\sigma)\approx s_{\theta} = (D_{\theta}(\mathbf{x};\sigma) - \mathbf{x}) / \sigma^{2}$  (Karras et al., 2022), where  $D_{\theta}$  is a learnable denoiser that, given a noisy data point  $\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n}$ ,  $\mathbf{x}\sim p_{\mathrm{data}}(\mathbf{x})$ ,  $\mathbf{n}\sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{0},\sigma^2\right)$  and conditioned on the noise level  $\sigma$ , tries to predict the clean  $\mathbf{x}$ . The denoiser  $D_{\theta}$  can be trained by minimizing an  $L_{2}$ -loss

$$
\underset {\boldsymbol {\theta}} {\arg \min } \mathbb {E} _ {\mathbf {x} \sim p _ {\mathrm {d a t a}} (\mathbf {x}), \sigma \sim p (\sigma), \mathbf {n} \sim \mathcal {N} (\mathbf {0}, \sigma^ {2})} \left[ \lambda (\sigma) \| D _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} + \mathbf {n}, \sigma) - \mathbf {x} \| _ {2} ^ {2} \right], \tag {3}
$$

where  $\lambda (\sigma)\colon \mathbb{R}_{+}\to \mathbb{R}_{+}$  is a weighting function. Previous works proposed various denoiser models  $D_{\theta}$ , noise distributions  $p(\sigma)$ , and weightings  $\lambda (\sigma)$ . We refer to the triplet  $(D_{\theta},p,\lambda)$  as the DM config. Here, we consider four such config: variance preserving (VP) (Song et al., 2021c), variance exploding (VE) (Song et al., 2021c), v-prediction (Salimans & Ho, 2022), and the config introduced in Karras et al. (2022) (referred to as Elucidate in this work); App. C.1 for details.

# 2.2 DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY

DP is a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy applied to statistical queries; in our work the queries correspond to the training of a neural network using sensitive training data. Informally, training is said to be DP, if, given the trained weights  $\theta$  of the network, an adversary cannot tell with certainty whether a particular data point was part of the training data. This degree of certainty is controlled by two positive parameters  $\varepsilon$  and  $\delta$ : training becomes more private as  $\varepsilon$  and  $\delta$  decrease. Note, however, that there is an inherent trade-off between utility and privacy: very private models may be of little to no practical use. To guarantee a sufficient amount of privacy, as a rule of thumb,  $\delta$  should not be larger than  $1/N$ , where  $N$  is number of training points  $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N$ , and  $\varepsilon$  should be a small constant. More formally, we refer to  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -DP defined as follows (Dwork et al., 2006):

Definition 2.1. (Differential Privacy) A randomized mechanism  $\mathcal{M}:\mathcal{D}\to \mathcal{R}$  with domain  $\mathcal{D}$  and range  $\mathcal{R}$  satisfies  $(\varepsilon ,\delta)$ -DP if for any two datasets  $d,d^{\prime}\in \mathcal{D}$  differing by at most one entry, and for any subset of outputs  $S\subseteq \mathcal{R}$  it holds that

$$
\Pr [ \mathcal {M} (d) \in S ] \leq e ^ {\varepsilon} \Pr [ \mathcal {M} \left(d ^ {\prime}\right) \in S ] + \delta . \tag {4}
$$

DP-SGD. We require a DP algorithm that trains a neural network using sensitive data. The workhorse for this particular task is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) (Abadi et al., 2016). DP-SGD is a modification of SGD for which per-sample-gradients are clipped and noise is added to the clipped gradients; the DP-SGD parameter updates are defined as follows

$$
\boldsymbol {\theta} \leftarrow \boldsymbol {\theta} - \frac {\eta}{B} \left(\sum_ {i \in \mathbb {B}} \operatorname {c l i p} _ {C} \left(\nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} l _ {i} (\boldsymbol {\theta})\right) + C \mathbf {z}\right), \quad \mathbf {z} \sim \mathcal {N} (\mathbf {0}, \sigma_ {\mathrm {D P}} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {I}), \tag {5}
$$

where  $\mathbb{B}$  is a  $B$ -sized subset of  $\{1, \dots, N\}$  drawn uniformly at random,  $l_i$  is the loss function for data point  $\mathbf{x}_i$ ,  $\eta$  is the learning rate, and the clipping function is  $\operatorname{clip}_C(\mathbf{g}) = \min \left\{1, C / \| \mathbf{g} \|_2\right\} \mathbf{g}$ . DP-SGD can be adapted to other first-order optimizers, such as Adam (McMahan et al., 2018).

Privacy Accounting. According to the Gaussian mechanism (Dwork et al., 2014), a single DP-SGD update (Eq. (5)) satisfies  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -DP if  $\sigma_{\mathrm{DP}}^2 > 2\log(1.25/\delta)C^2/\varepsilon^2$ . Privacy accounting methods can be used to compose the privacy cost of multiple DP-SGD training updates and to determine the variance  $\sigma_{\mathrm{DP}}^2$  needed to satisfy  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -DP for a particular number of DP-SGD updates with clipping constant  $C$  and subsampling rate  $B/N$ . Also see App. A.

# 3 DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE DIFFUSION MODELS

We propose DPDMs, DMs trained with rigorous DP guarantees based on DP-SGD. In Sec. 3.1, we discuss the motivation for using DMs for DP generative modeling. In Sec. 3.2, we then discuss training and methodological details as well as DM design choices, and we prove that DPDMs satisfy DP.

# 3.1 MOTIVATION

(i) Objective function. GANs have so far been the workhorse of DP generative modeling (see Sec. 4), even though they are generally difficult to optimize (Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017; Mescheder et al., 2018) due to their adversarial training and propensity to mode collapse. Both phenomena may be amplified during DP-SGD training. DMs, in contrast, have been shown to produce outputs as good or even better than GANs' (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021), while being trained with a very simple regression-like  $L_{2}$ -loss (Eq. (3)), which makes them robust and scalable in practice. DMs are therefore arguably also well-suited for DP-SGD-based training and offer better stability under gradient clipping and noising than adversarial training frameworks.

Figure 2: Frobenius norm of the Jacobian  $\mathcal{J}_F(\sigma)$  of the denoiser  $D(\cdot, \sigma)$  and constant Frobenius norms of the Jacobians  $\mathcal{J}_F$  of the sampling functions defined by the DM and a GAN. App. D for experiment details.

(ii) Sequential denoising. In GANs and most other traditional generative modeling approaches, the generator directly learns the sampling function, i.e., the mapping of latents to synthesized samples, end-to-end. In contrast, the sampling function in DMs is defined through a sequential denoising process, breaking the difficult generation task into many small denoising steps which are individually less complex than the one-shot synthesis task performed by, for instance, a GAN generator. The denoiser neural network, the learnable component in DMs that is evaluated once per denoising step, is therefore simpler and smoother than the one-shot generator networks of other methods. We fit both a DM and a GAN to a two-dimensional toy distribution (mixture of Gaussians, see App. D) and empirically verify that the denoiser  $D$  is indeed significantly less complex (quantified by the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian) than the generator learnt by the GAN and also than the end-to-end multi-step synthesis process (Probability Flow ODE) of the DM (see Fig. 2; we calculate denoiser  $\mathcal{J}_F(\sigma)$  at varying noise levels  $\sigma$ ). Generally, more complex functions require larger neural networks and are more difficult learn. Note, however, that the  $L_{2}$ -norm of the noise added in the DP-SGD updates scales linearly with the number of parameters, and therefore smaller networks are generally preferred. Moreover, in DP-SGD training we only have a limited number of training iterations available until the privacy budget is depleted. Consequently, the fact that DMs require less complexity out of their neural networks than typical one-shot generation methods, while still being able to represent expressive generative models due to the iterative synthesis process, makes them likely well-suited for DP generative modeling with DP-SGD.

(iii) Stochastic diffusion model sampling. As discussed in Sec. 2.1, generating samples from DMs with stochastic sampling can perform better than deterministic sampling when the score model is not learned well. Since we replace gradient estimates in DP-SGD training with biased large variance

estimators, we cannot expect a perfectly accurate score model. In Sec. 5.2, we empirically show that stochastic sampling can in fact boost perceptual synthesis quality in DPDMs as measured by FID.

# 3.2 TRAINING DETAILS, DESIGN CHOICES, PRIVACY

The clipping and noising of the gradient estimates in DP-SGD (Eq. (5)) pose a major challenge for efficient optimization. Blindly reducing the added noise or increasing the clipping constant  $C$  could be fatal, as it decreases the number of training iterations allowed within a certain  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -DP budget. Furthermore, as discussed the  $L_{2}$ -norm of the noise added in DP-SGD scales linearly to the number of parameters. Consequently, settings that work well for non-private DMs, such as relatively small batch sizes, a large number of training iterations, and heavily overparameterized models, may not work well for DPDMs. Below, we discuss how we propose to adjust DPDMs for successful DP-SGD training.

Noise multiplicity. Recall that the DM objective in Eq. (3) involves three expectations. As usual, the expectation with respect to the data distribution  $p_{\mathrm{data}}(\mathbf{x})$  is approximated using mini-batching. For non-private DMs, the expectations over  $\sigma$  and  $\mathbf{n}$  are generally approximated using a single Monte Carlo sample  $(\sigma_i, \mathbf{n}_i) \sim p(\sigma) \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \sigma^2)$  per data point  $\mathbf{x}_i$ , resulting in the loss for training sample  $i$

$$
l _ {i} = \lambda (\sigma_ {i}) \| D _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {i} + \mathbf {n} _ {i}, \sigma_ {i}\right) - \mathbf {x} _ {i} \| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {6}
$$

The estimator  $l_{i}$  is very noisy in practice. Non-private DMs counteract this by training for a large number of iterations in combination with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the trainable parameters  $\theta$  (Song & Ermon, 2020). When training DMs with DP-SGD, we incur a privacy cost for each iteration, and therefore prefer a small number of iterations. Furthermore, since the per-example gradient clipping as well as the noise injection induce additional variance, we would like our objective function to be less noisy than in the non-DP case. We achieve this by estimating the expectation over  $\sigma$  and  $\mathbf{n}$  using an average over  $K$  noise samples,  $\{(\sigma_{ik},\mathbf{n}_{ik})\}_{k = 1}^{K}\sim p(\sigma)\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{0},\sigma^2\right)$  for each data point  $\mathbf{x}_i$ , replacing the non-private DM objective  $l_{i}$  in Eq. (6) with

$$
\tilde {l} _ {i} = \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \lambda \left(\sigma_ {i k}\right) \| D _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {i} + \mathbf {n} _ {i k}, \sigma_ {i k}\right) - \mathbf {x} _ {i} \| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {7}
$$

Importantly, we show that this modification comes at no additional privacy cost (also see App. A). We call this simple yet powerful modification of the DM objective, which is tailored to the DP setup, noise multiplicity. The noise multiplicity mechanism is also highlighted in Fig. 1: the figure describes the information flow during training for a single training sample (i.e., batch size  $B = 1$ ). Intuitively, the key is that we first create a relatively accurate low-variance gradient estimate by averaging over multiple noise samples before performing gradient sanitization in the backward pass via clipping and noising. Ideas similar to our noise multiplicity have recently been also used to train classifiers with DP-SGD, where multiple augmentations per image are used (De et al., 2022). We empirically showcase the benefit of noise multiplicity in Sec. 5.2.

Neural networks sizes. Current DMs are heavily overparameterized: For example, the current state-of-the-art image generation model (in terms of perceptual quality) on CIFAR-10 uses more than 100M parameters, despite the dataset consisting of only 50k training points (Karras et al., 2022). Using such heavily overparameterized models for DP-SGD training may not be effective because the  $L_{2}$ -norm of the noise added in the DP-SGD update scales linearly to the number of parameters. Furthermore, the per-example clipping operation of DP-SGD requires the computation of the loss gradient on each training example  $\nabla_{\theta}\tilde{l}_i$ , rather than the minibatch gradient. In theory,

![](images/bc7ac808f44899a50424368c6ec6bb0895ce82a6f9d3cd2a356aa54b3f239ef1.jpg)  
Figure 3: Noise level sampling for different DM config; see App. C.1.

this increases the memory footprint by at least  $\mathcal{O}(B)$ ; however, in practice the peak memory requirement is  $\mathcal{O}(B^2)$  compared to non-private training (Yousefpour et al., 2021). On top of that, DP-SGD generally already relies on a significantly increased batch size, when compared to non-private training, to improve the privacy-utility trade-off. As a result, for both methodological as well as practical reasons, we train very small neural networks for DPDMs, when compared to their non-DP counterparts: our models on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST and CelebA have 1.75M and 1.80M parameters, respectively.

Diffusion model config. In addition to network size, we found the choice of DM config, i.e., denoiser parameterization  $D_{\theta}$ , weighting function  $\lambda(\sigma)$ , and noise distribution  $p(\sigma)$ , to be important. In particular the latter is crucial to obtain strong results with DPDMs. In Fig. 3, we visualize the noise distributions of the four config under consideration. We follow Karras et al. (2022) and plot the distribution

$p(\log \sigma)$  over the log-noise level. Especially for high privacy settings (small  $\varepsilon$ ), we found it important to use distributions that give sufficiently much weight to larger  $\sigma$ , such as the distribution of v-prediction (Salimans & Ho, 2022). It is known that at large  $\sigma$  the DM learns the global, coarse structure of the data, i.e., the low frequency content in the data (images, in our case). Learning global structure reasonably well is crucial to form visually coherent images that can also be used to train downstream models. This is relatively easy to achieve in the non-DP setting, due to the heavily smoothed diffused distribution at these high noise level. At high privacy levels, however, even training at such high noise levels can be challenging due to DP-SGD's gradient clipping and noising. We hypothesize that this is why it is beneficial to give relatively more weight to high noise levels when training in the DP setting. In Sec. 5.2, we empirically demonstrate the importance of the right choice of the DM config.

DP-SGD settings. Following De et al. (2022) we use very large batch sizes: 4096 on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST and 2048 on CelebA. Similar to previous works (De et al., 2022; Kurakin et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022), we found that small clipping constants  $C$  work better than larger clipping norms; in particular, we found  $C = 1$  to work well across our experiments. Decreasing  $C$  even further had little effect; in contrast, increasing  $C$  significantly worsened performance. Similar to non-private DMs, we use an EMA of the learnable parameters  $\theta$ . Incidentally, this has recently been reported to also have a positive effect on DP-SGD training of classifiers by De et al. (2022).

Privacy. We formulate privacy protection under the Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) (Mironov, 2017) framework (see Def

inition A.1), which can be converted to  $(\epsilon, \delta)$ -DP. For an algorithm for DPDM training with noise multiplicity see Alg. 1. For the sake of completeness we also formally prove the DP of DPDMs (DP of releasing sanitized training gradients  $\tilde{G}_{batch}$ ):

Theorem 1. For noise magnitude  $\sigma_{\mathrm{DP}}$ , releasing  $\tilde{G}_{\text{batch}}$  in Alg. 1 satisfies  $(\alpha, \alpha / 2\sigma_{\mathrm{DP}}^2)$ -RDP.

The proof can be found in App. A. Note that the strength of DP protection is independent of the noise multiplicity, as discussed above. In practice, we construct mini-batches by Poisson Sampling (See Alg. 2) the training dataset for privacy amplification via sub-sampling (Mironov et al., 2019), and compute the overall privacy cost of training DPDM via RDP composition (Mironov, 2017).

# 4 RELATED WORK

In the DP generative learning literature, several works (Xie et al., 2018; Frigerio et al., 2019; Torkzadehmahani et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020) have explored applying DP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016) to GANs, while others (Yoon et al., 2019; Long et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021) train GANs under the PATE (Papernot et al., 2018) framework, which distills private teacher models (discriminators) into a public student (generator) model. Apart from GANs, Acs et al. (2018) train variational autoencoders on DP-sanitized data clusters, and Cao et al. (2021) use the Sinkhorn divergence and DP-SGD.

DP-MERF (Harder et al., 2021) was the first work to perform one-shot privatization on the data, followed by non-private learning. It uses differentially private random Fourier features to construct a Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss, which is then minimized by a generative model. PEARL (Liew et al., 2022) instead minimizes an empirical characteristic function, also based on Fourier features. DP-MEPF (Harder et al., 2022) extends DP-MERF to the mixed public-private setting with pre-trained feature extractors. While these approaches are efficient in the high-privacy/small dataset regime, they are limited in expressivity by the data statistics that can be extracted during one-shot privatization. As a result, the performance of these methods does not scale well in the low-privacy/large dataset regime.

In our experimental comparisons, we excluded Takagi et al. (2021) and Chen et al. (2022) due to concerns regarding their privacy guarantees. The privacy analysis of Takagi et al. (2021) relies on the Wishart mechanism, which has been retracted due to privacy leakage (Sarwate, 2017). Chen

et al. (2022) attempt to train a score-based model while guaranteeing differential privacy through a data-dependent randomized response mechanism. In App. B, we prove why their proposed mechanism leaks privacy, and further discuss other sources of privacy leakage.

Our DPDM relies on DP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016) to enforce DP guarantees. DP-SGD has also been used to train DP classifiers (Dörmann et al., 2021; Tramer & Boneh, 2021; Kurakin et al., 2022). Recently, De et al. (2022) demonstrated how to train very large discriminative models with DP-SGD and proposed augmentation multiplicity, which is related to our noise multiplicity, as discussed in Sec. 3.2. Furthermore, DP-SGD has been utilized to train and fine-tune large language models (Anil et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022), to protect sensitive training data in the medical domain (Ziller et al., 2021a;b; Balelli et al., 2022), and to obscure geo-spatial location information (Zeighami et al., 2022).

Our work builds on DMs and score-based generative models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song et al., 2021c; Ho et al., 2020). DMs have been used prominently for image synthesis (Ho et al., 2021; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Rombach et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2022; Sahara et al., 2022) and other image modeling tasks (Meng et al., 2021; Sahara et al., 2021a;b; Li et al., 2021; Sasaki et al., 2021; Kawar et al., 2022), and also found applications in other areas, for instance audio and speech generation (Chen et al., 2021; Kong et al., 2021; Jeong et al., 2021). Methodologically, DMs have been adapted, for example, for fast sampling (Jolicoeur-Martineau et al., 2021; Song et al., 2021a; Salimans & Ho, 2022; Dockhorn et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2022; Watson et al., 2022) and maximum likelihood training (Song et al., 2021b; Kingma et al., 2021; Vahdat et al., 2021). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to train DMs under differential privacy guarantees.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

Datasets. We focus on image synthesis and use MNIST (LeCun et al., 2010), Fashion-MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017) (both 28x28 resolution), and CelebA (Liu et al., 2015) (center-cropped; downsampled to 32x32 resolution). These three datasets are widely used in the DP generative modeling literature as standard benchmarks. They contain 50k, 50k, and 162k training images, respectively.

Architectures. We implement the neural networks of DPDMs using the DDPM++ architecture (Song et al., 2021c). For class-conditioning, we add a learned class-embedding. See App. C.2 for details.

Evaluation. We measure sample quality via Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017). On MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, we also assess utility of class-labeled generated data by training classifiers on synthesized samples and compute class prediction accuracy on real data. As is standard practice, we consider logistic regression (Log Reg), MLP, and CNN classifiers; see App. E.1 for details.

Sampling. We generate samples from DPDM using (stochastic) DDIM (Song et al., 2021c) and the Churn sampler introduced in (Karras et al., 2022). See App. C.3 for details and pseudocode.

Privacy implementation: We implement DPDMs in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and use Opacus (Yousefpour et al., 2021), a DP-SGD library in PyTorch, for training and privacy accounting. We use  $\delta = 10^{-5}$  for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and  $\delta = 10^{-6}$  for CelebA. These values are standard (Cao et al., 2021) and chosen such that  $\delta$  is smaller than the reciprocal of the number of training images. Similar to existing DP generative modeling work, we do not account for the (small) privacy cost of hyperparameter tuning. However, training and sampling is very robust with regards to hyperparameters, which makes DPDMs an ideal candidate for real privacy-critical situations; see App. C.4.

ate, and low amounts of privacy, respectively. The DPDMs use the v-prediction DM config (Salimans & Ho, 2022) for  $\varepsilon = 0.2$  and the Elucidate DM config (Karras et al., 2022) for  $\varepsilon = \{1, 10\}$ ; see Sec. 5.2. We use the Churn sampler (Karras et al., 2022): the two settings (FID) and (Acc) are based on the same DM, differing only in sampler setting; see Tab. 14 and Tab. 15 for all sampler settings.

DPDMs outperform all other existing models for all privacy settings and all metrics by large margins (see Tab. 1). Interestingly, DPDM also outperforms DP-MEPF (Harder et al., 2022), a method which is trained on additional public data, in 22 out of 24 setups. Generated samples for  $\varepsilon = 10$  are shown in Fig. 4. Visually, DPDM's samples appear to be of significantly higher quality than the baselines'.

Comparison to DP-SGD-trained classifiers. Is it better to train a task-specific private classifier with DP-SGD directly, or can a non-private classifier trained on DPDM's synthesized data perform as well on downstream tasks? To answer this question, we train private classifiers with DP-SGD on real (training) data and compare them to our classifiers learnt using DPDM-synthesized data (details in App. E.3). For a fair comparison, we are using the same architectures that we have already been using in our main experiments to quantify downstream classification accuracy (results in Tab. 2; we test on real (test) data). While direct DP-SGD training on real data outperforms the DPDM downstream classifier for logistic regression in all six setups (in line with empirical findings that it is easier to train classifiers with

few parameters than large ones with DP-SGD (Tramer & Boneh, 2021)), CNN classifiers trained on DPDM's synthetic data generally outperform DP-SGD-trained classifiers. These results imply a very high utility of the synthetic data generated by DPDMs, demonstrating that DPDMs can potentially be used as an effective, privacy-preserving data sharing medium in practice. In fact, this approach is beneficial over training task-specific models with DP-SGD, because a user can generate as much data from DPDMs as they desire for various downstream applications without further privacy implications. To the best of our knowledge, it has not been demonstrated before in the DP generative modeling literature that (image) data generated by DP generative models can be used to train discriminative models on-par with directly DP-SGD-trained task-specific models.

Unconditional color image generation. On CelebA, we train models for  $\varepsilon = \{1, 10\}$  (Tab. 4 & Fig. 5). The two DPDMs use the Elucidate config (Karras et al., 2022) as well as the Churn sampler; see Tab. 14. For  $\varepsilon = 10$ , DPDM again outperforms existing methods by a significant margin. DPDM's synthesized images appear much more diverse and vivid than the baselines' samples.

# 5.2 ABLATION STUDIES

Noise multiplicity. Tab. 3 shows results for DPDMs trained with different noise multiplicity  $K$ . As expected, increasing  $K$  leads to a general trend of improving performance; however, the metrics start to plateau at around  $K = 32$ . Table 5: DM config ablation on MNIST for

Diffusion model config. We train DPDMs with different DM config (see App. C.1). VP- and VE-based models (Song et al., 2021c) perform poorly for all settings, while for  $\varepsilon = 0.2$  v-prediction significantly outperforms the Elucidate DM config on MNIST (Tab. 5).

On Fashion-MNIST, the advantage is less significant (extended Tab. 12). For  $\varepsilon = \{1,10\}$ , the Elucidate DM config performs better than v-prediction. Note that the denoiser parameterization for these config is almost identical and their main difference is the noise distribution  $p(\sigma)$  (Fig. 3). As discussed in Sec. 3.2, oversampling large noise levels  $\sigma$  is expected to be especially important for the large privacy setting (small  $\varepsilon$ ), which is validated by our ablation.

Sampling. Tab. 6 shows results for different samplers: deterministic and stochastic DDIM (Song et al., 2021a) as well as the Churn sampler (tuned for high FID scores and downstream accuracy). Stochastic sampling is crucial to obtain good perceptual quality, as measured by FID (see poor performance of deterministic DDIM), while it is less important for downstream accuracy. We hypothesize that FID better captures image details that require a sufficiently accurate synthesis process. As discussed in Secs. 2.1 and 3.1, stochastic sampling can help with that and therefore is particularly important in DP-SGD-trained DMs. We also observe that the advantage of the Churn sampler compared to stochastic DDIM becomes less significant as  $\varepsilon$  increases. Moreover, in particular for  $\varepsilon = 0.2$  the FID-adjusted Churn sampler performs poorly on downstream accuracy. This is arguably because its settings sacrifice sample diversity, which downstream accuracy usually benefits from, in favor of synthesis quality (also see samples in App. E.5).

# 6 CONCLUSIONS

We proposed Differentially Private Diffusion Models (DPDMs), which use DP-SGD to enforce DP guarantees during DM training. DMs are strong candidates for DP generative learning due to their robust training objective and intrinsically less complex denoising neural networks. We perform an in-depth analysis of the ideal DPDM parametrization and sampling strategy and introduce noise multiplicity to boost synthesis quality. DPDMs achieve state-of-the-art performance in common DP image generation benchmarks. Furthermore, downstream classifiers trained with DPDM-generated synthetic data perform on-par with task-specific discriminative models trained

with DP-SGD directly. Based on our promising results, we conclude that DMs are an ideal generative modeling framework for DP generative learning. We hope that DPDMs can grow into a practical tool for effective data sharing in the form of a generative model that can produce synthetic but useful data, while preserving the privacy of the generative model's original training data. Moreover, we believe that advancing DM-based DP generative modeling is a pressing topic, considering the extremely fast progress of DM-based large-scale photo-realistic image generation systems (Rombach et al., 2021; Saharia et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022). As future directions we envision applying our DPDM approach during training of such large image generation DMs, as well as applying DPDMs to other types of data.

# 7 ETHICS AND REPRODUCIBILITY

Our work improves the state-of-the-art in differentially private generative modeling and we validate our proposed DPDMs on image synthesis benchmarks. Generative modeling of images has promising applications, for example for digital content creation and artistic expression (Bailey, 2020), but it can in principle also be used for malicious purposes (Vaccari & Chadwick, 2020; Mirsky & Lee, 2021; Nguyen et al., 2021). However, differentially private image generation methods, including our DPDM, are currently not able to produce photo-realistic content, which makes such abuse unlikely.

As discussed in Sec. 1, a severe issue in modern generative models is that they can easily overfit to the data distribution, thereby closely reproducing training samples and leaking privacy of the training data. Our DPDMs aim to rigorously address such problems via the well-established DP framework and fundamentally protect the privacy of the training data and prevent overfitting to individual data samples. This is especially important when training generative models on diverse and privacy-sensitive data. Therefore, DPDMs can potentially act as an effective medium for data sharing without needing to worry about data privacy, which we hope will benefit the broader machine learning community. Note, however, that although DPDM provides privacy protection in generative learning, information about individuals cannot be eliminated entirely, as no useful model can be learned under DP-  $(\varepsilon = 0,\delta = 0)$ . This should be communicated clearly to dataset participants.

To aid reproducibility of the results and methods presented in our paper, we will make source code to reproduce all quantitative and qualitative results of the paper publicly available, including detailed instructions. Moreover, all training details and hyperparameters are already described in detail in the Appendix, in particular in App. C.
