# Abstract

Developments in machine learning interpretability techniques over the past decade have provided new tools to observe the image regions that are most informative for classification and localization in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Are the same regions similarly informative to human observers? Using data from 78 new experiments and 6,610 participants we show that passive attention techniques reveal a significant overlap with human visual selectivity estimates derived from 6 distinct behavioral tasks including visual discrimination, spatial localization, recognizability, free-viewing, cued-object search and saliency search fixations. We find that input visualizations derived from relatively simple ANN architectures probed using guided backpropagation methods are the best predictors of a shared component in the joint variability of the human measures. We validate these correlational results with causal manipulations using recognition experiments. We show that images masked with ANN attention maps were easier for humans to classify compared with control masks in a speeded recognition experiment. Similarly, we find that recognition performance in the same ANN models was likewise influenced by masking input images using human visual selectivity maps. This work contributes a new approach to evaluating the biological and psychological validity of leading ANNs as models of human vision: by examining their similarities and differences in terms of their visual selectivity to the information contained in images.

# 1 Introduction

The last decade has witnessed the rise of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that can match and even exceed human performance on a variety of perceptual and cognitive tasks, ranging from image recognition [1] to natural language processing and reinforcement learning [2]. Alongside the rapid development of these technologies, a significant body of work aimed at improving the interpretability of these systems and comparing them to biological ones has also grown [3, 4, 5]. In computer vision, techniques for probing which visual regions ANNs "attend to" when classifying images have been developed to visualize the receptive fields of convolutional layers as well as regions of a visual input that most influence the class activations of the models [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In neuroscience, researchers began to quantify the functional fidelity of leading ANNs as models of the human visual system using both neural and behavioral benchmarks [11]. Finally, cognitive scientists have developed techniques to compare the structure of ANN learned representations to human psychological representations [12, 13]. All these efforts have contributed to our understanding of the biological and psychological validity of leading ANNs as models of biological vision, beyond just assessing their performance on standard object categorization benchmarks.

Previous analyses of the correspondence between ANNs and human vision have focused on the representations used by the systems. However, a natural question is whether ANNs select information

in the same way, and in particular whether they attend to the same visual regions as humans when extracting information for visual object recognition and localization. While prior work has developed ANNs trained explicitly to predict human visual gaze [14], and even incorporated simulated foveated systems into the model design [15], comparatively little work comparing human attention to computational attention [16, 17, 18] has attempted a comprehensive examination of how ANNs compare to humans using a variety of human visual selectivity measures as well as the wide range of interpretability techniques that are currently available to probe what visual information ANNs use.

Methods for gaining insight into what is learned by ANNs started with "passive" attention gradient-based approaches designed to reveal which visual inputs influence the class activation score the most [19]. More advanced techniques using deconvolution and guided backpropagation methods followed [7, 20] as well as techniques that introduced novel design alterations, such as global average pooling layers and class activation mapping (CAM) to localize class-specific visual regions in the input images [8]. Finally, more general approaches that could be applied to architectures without global average pooling [21] appeared, with some of the most recent contributions proposing class activation mapping techniques that do not rely on gradients at all [22]. Aside from this range of "passive" techniques, computer scientists have also developed CNN models that incorporate end-to-end trainable attention modules [23, 24] both as a means for improving interpretability and boosting performance. The full range of techniques now available for visualizing the information that is most relevant for classification and localization in ANNs offer an unprecedented and unique opportunity for comparing their results to biological analogues in estimates of biases in human visual localization, attention, encoding precision, and visual recognition over image regions.

Since the early 19th century [25] vision scientists devoted to the study of biological vision have likewise developed a variety of experimental techniques for estimating the visual information used by the primate visual system when engaged in similar perceptual and cognitive tasks such as visual search, localization, and recognition. Among these are measures of visual change sensitivity (discrimination accuracy), visuospatial memory (spatial localization estimation), as well as explicit reports of visual recognizability. In this work, we used six different perceptual tasks (three eye-movement tasks (Fig. 1C and Fig. 2A), a change sensitivity task (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2A), a spatial localization task (Fig. 1D and Fig. 2A), and explicit visual recognizability estimates using a recent behavioral task [26, 27] (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2A). We then compared them to estimates of ANN visual selectivity using a variety of pretrained models and visualization techniques including guided backpropagation and techniques based on class activation mapping. We used a range of model types, including early convolutional networks like AlexNet [1], as well as recent near-state-of-the-art models, such as EfficientNet [28].

We find that only a select class of ANN models and passive attention techniques capture the shared variance across all human visual selectivity measures. This work contributes to current efforts aimed at evaluating the biological and psychological validity of contemporary ANNs by investigating the similarity between artificial and biological vision systems at the level of the visual inputs rather than the learned representations or correspondence to patterns of neural activation in visual cortex [11].

# 2 Human Visual Selectivity Measures

We computed 6 behavioral measures with 25 images, performing experiments in which a total of 4,050 participants took part (see Table 1 in the Appendix). We ran experiments for 3 distinct human behavioral tasks for each image (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 for representative examples). A total of 1,575 participants took part in the discrimination accuracy experiments (an average of 63 participants for each of the 25 images), and 9 participants took part in each of the image patch ratings tasks (225 participants in total). Finally, the spatial memory serial reproduction chain experiments were completed by a total of 2,250 participants (an average of 90 participants for each of the images). Participants were recruited anonymously over Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), and provided informed consent. Participants were paid approximately $7 per hour. Details of the experimental procedures, design, and map estimation for each task can be found in Appendix Fig. S1.

1. Visual recognizability. We adopted a recent behavioral task [26, 27] designed to measure the informativeness and recognizability of local image regions by using explicit self-reports (see Fig. 1A). In the task, participants view small circular image patches sampled from full images and rate how "recognizable" or "informative" the content of the patch is on a six-point Likert scale ranging from a rating of "Very low recognizability" to "Very high recognizability". The patches were sampled from

a regular  $20 \times 20$  grid over the image. Fig. 2A shows representative examples of the results following averaging over all the ratings in different spatial areas of the images, smoothing, and interpolation to produce continuous maps for each image. We ran 25 experiments with an average of 9 participants per image (see Appendix for details of the map generation procedure). A total of 225 participants took part in the patch ratings experiments. Participants were paid $2 to complete 144 experimental trials.  
2. Change sensitivity (Discrimination). We measured change sensitivity using a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) discrimination task. In this task, participants viewed an image with a small red dot superimposed on it for 1000 milliseconds. Following a 1000 millisecond delay, the same image was presented again with the dot in either the same exact location or in a slightly displaced location (see Fig 1B). Participants were then asked to indicate if the dot was shifted or unchanged in the second presentation. Crucially, the locations of the initial dot locations were sampled densely from all possible locations on a regular grid that spanned the dimensions of the image, in order to measure changes in visual change sensitivity over the entire image (see Appendix for details). This task measures changes in visual acuity conditioned on different visual areas in an image, and has been used as a proxy for measuring variable encoding precision of different image regions [29]. We ran 25 experiments (one for each image) with an average of 63 participants per experiment. The overall number of participants for the discrimination tasks equalled 1,575. Participants were paid $1.50 to complete 120 trials in the discrimination task.  
3. Visuospatial localization. We used a recent behavioral paradigm based on serial reproduction that can reveal intricate spatial memory priors that guide visual localization estimation in humans [29]. In this paradigm the first participant views a point superimposed on an image and then reproduces its location from memory. The next participant views the same image but with the point located in the position reconstructed by the previous participant. As in the "telephone game," the process is repeated, forming a chain of participants. For each image, there were a total of 20 iterations in the chains, for 250 initial random seed dot positions. This experimental procedure is known to reveal the spatial landmarks in visual scenes that bias human allocentric visuospatial representations (see [29] and Fig. 1D). We ran 25 experiments (one for each image) with an average of 63 participants each. The overall number of participants was 2,250. Participants were paid a base rate of  $1.00 for completing 105 trials in the spatial memory experiment but could earn up to$ 1.50 depending on accuracy in the task. Additional details are provided in the Appendix.

4. Fixations. Finally, we used an existing dataset of human fixations obtained via eye-tracking when human participants were engaged in a free-viewing task, a cued object search task, and a saliency search task [30] (Fig. 1C). We used the published data from the 75 experiments reported in [30].

# 3 ANN Models, Passive and Active Attention

We evaluated three standard deep convolutional neural network architectures (AlexNet [1], VGGNet [19], ResNet [31]), as well as a state-of-the-art architecture (EfficientNet [32]). For each of these models, which do not have active attention modules, we obtained attention maps using a range of passive methods described below. We also evaluated two built-in end-to-end trainable attention modules. All models were pretrained on ImageNet [33] or CIFAR-100 [34] image datasets. See Table 2 in the Appendix for a list of all methods.

# 3.1 Passive Attention

We used gradient-based techniques including guided backpropagation methods [20, 35], as well as more recent techniques based on class activation mapping [21, 22] (see Fig. 1E for a schematic example of passive attention). The methods based on guided backpropagation effectively try to compute the sensitivity of the model's output with respect to each pixel in the input image, using various techniques for increasing the signal in these maps and decreasing noise. These methods include standard guided backpropagation (GBP), guided gradients times the image (GBPxIM), and SmoothGrad with guided backpropagation (SGBP). The methods based on class activation mapping compute linear combinations of the activation maps in the final convolutional layer of the model in order to determine the discriminative regions of the image used by the model. These methods include Grad-CAM and Score-CAM. See the Appendix for details on all the passive attention methods mentioned here.

# 3.2 Active Attention

We used two different active attention modules. These active attention modules are trainable, and they learn to generate masks which are applied to the input image (or to intermediate convolutional layers). These masks are effectively explicit attention maps, so we do not have to use passive attention methods to try to discern the models' attention. These attention modules can be incorporated into essentially any standard CNN architecture, so we chose a few for which we were able to obtain pretrained weights (see the Appendix for details).

One attention module is described in the paper Learn to Pay Attention [23], which we will refer to as LTPA. LTPA inserts attention at three intermediate convolutional layers within a VGGNet architecture. The other active attention module is used in Attention Branch Networks (ABNs) [24]. ABN has a separate "attention branch" that runs in parallel with a "perception branch," and is based on class activation mapping [8].

# 4 Passive Attention Predicts Shared Variance Across Human Measures

Human experiments. Fig. 2A shows representative results from each of the human behavioral experiments. We found that the human maps were correlated with one another though the correlations varied from  $r = 0.14$  to 0.86 (see Fig. 2B) due to variations in the visual regions that were the most implicated from one task to another. We obtained a single factor that captures the maximal amount of shared variance across all behavioral maps ("Human PC"; see Fig. 2C) by computing a linear combination of the results of the six experiments via Principal Component Analysis (see SI material for details and formal description). The Human PC was correlated with each of the six behavioral measures ( $r = .75, .74, .42, .81, .81$  and .73 for the informativeness maps, change sensitivity maps, spatial localization maps, and each of the fixation maps, respectively).

ANN maps. We then compared the maps computed by the ANN attention methods (Fig. 3A; Raw ANN maps are included in Appendix Fig. S2). We found that that ANN maps varied significantly in terms of their level of "smoothness" depending on the attention method. Because of this, and in order to compare the human and ANN maps in a way that is agnostic to the raw smoothness of the ANN maps, we introduced a smoothing parameter when comparing the two. We optimized the smoothing

Examples of ANN maps for the same images are also shown. B. Cross correlations of all the maps, including the linear combination of all the maps that predicts the maximal shared variance (Human PC), are shown. While most methods are relatively highly intercorrelated, there are clear differences. Fixations were the most highly intercorrelated  $(r = .72\text{-}.86)$ , while spatial memory Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) are only weakly correlated  $(r = .14\text{-}.17)$  to the fixations, in line with previous findings [29]. Factor loadings of each of the six measures to Human PC were uniformly high  $(r = .42\text{-}.81)$ . C. Human PC maps examples.

parameter for each of the ANN maps based on the correlation of the result to each of the human behavioral maps including the Human PC. We did this by applying the same smoothing to each of the individual 25 image ANN maps, and then computing the average Pearson correlation of those maps to the corresponding human maps for each of the 25 images. We repeated this process for each ANN attention method, and for each human task.

The relation between ANN and human maps. Next, we explored the relation between each of the human measures (including the PC factor) and the ANN attention maps. Fig. 3A shows the optimal correlations between human and ANN maps using the ANN maps optimized for peak correlations to the Human PC maps. The peak correlations between the Human PC maps and the most highly correlated ANN maps exceed the peak correlations of the same ANN maps to each of the six behavioral maps (Fig. 3B; PC average  $r = 0.71$ , compared with  $r = 0.36 - 0.65$  for each of the human maps). This suggests that the peak ANN maps predict the shared component of the variance between all the human measures rather than the variance of any particular human map type (such as human fixations or discrimination accuracy for instance). This is significant because it indicates that some intrinsic aspects of visual information contained in the images captured by the peak ANN models are predictive of human visual selectivity regardless of the behavioral task, and in spite of the clear differences between them [29]. Fig. 3B illustrates this fact for the human patch ratings task results. For most ANN maps, the correlation values under the diagonal in the plot indicate that the peak correlations of the ANN models to the Human PC were significantly higher than the peak correlations of the same ANN models to the Human patch ratings results. In addition, Fig. 3B shows the high overall correlation for some combination of ANN maps reaching a peak of  $r = 0.71$  for the SGBP method applied to the AlexNet network pretrained on ImageNet (alexnet-sgbp-I).

A natural question concerns whether the peak correlations achieved by the leading ANN maps are due to the model architecture, attention method, or training set. Fig. 3A shows correlations of the ANN maps to the human measures by attention type. We used the average correlations across the 6 measures and images as a dependent variable and found that the method category explains  $42.8\%$  of the variance, where architecture and training set categories explain  $15.9\%$  and  $1.0\%$  of the variance, respectively (see Fig. 3A for the average performance across all map types, and for each of the human

map types). This result suggests that attention type plays the most significant role in our findings. Surprisingly, SGBP applied to one of the simplest architectures (the AlexNet network pretrained on ImageNet) showed the highest correlation to the Human PC ( $r = 0.71$ ), and was significantly more predictive of the PC factor and human patch ratings than any of the other ANN maps ( $p < 0.001$  with Bonferroni corrections applied). Passive attention models were consistently predictive of the human maps across behavioral tasks (See Appendix Fig. S3 and S4). However, there was significant variation in the performance of the passive attention methods. On average, the SGBP method (average correlation of  $r = 0.46$ ) was only slightly better than active attention (average correlation of  $r = 0.42$ ) and a t-test revealed no significant difference between the two.

# 5 Validation experiment: ANN visual selectivity Boosts Human Recognition

We showed that the shared component of the variability across human behavioral measures is best predicted by attention maps computed using a particular class of passive attention methods, suggesting that recognition performance in both humans and machines is derived from the same visual information in images. However, this finding is based on indirect correlation evidence. In order to provide direct evidence for this claim, we tested whether human recognition performance is improved in real-time using the leading ANN maps via a speeded recognition experiment. We reasoned that recognition performance in humans will be better for images masked using their own attention maps ("correct masking") obtained from the best ANN maps (as defined by their peak correlation to the Human PC) compared with images masked using maps obtained for different images ("incorrect masking," see Fig. 4A for the masking procedure, and Fig. 4B for the speed recognition task design). Furthermore, we predicted that the difference in recognition performance on this task between these two conditions (correct masking vs. incorrect masking) would be greater if the masks are generated

using the leading ANN maps than if they are generated using ANN maps that are very dissimilar to the Human PC maps.

In the correct masking condition (blue bars), there was a significant difference between  $d'$  results for the SGBP maps relative to the  $d'$  results for the gradcam maps ( $p < 0.001$ ). Error bars were computed from 1000 bootstrapped samples of the human responses.  
D. Recognition d' results

To test these hypotheses, we ran two additional behavioral experiments with a total of 2,400 new participants recruited from AMT. Each participant viewed briefly flashed masked images (for 200 milliseconds), and had to select the best descriptors from a set of word pairs obtained from a separate labelling experiment in which a total of 160 participants took part (see Appendix). Masked images were generated by an element-wise product of a grayscale image with the map produced by the ANN model, see Fig. 4A. Correct masking consisted in masking an image with the map produced by the ANN for that image. Incorrect masking consisted in masking an image with the attention map produced by the ANN for different images. Representative examples of the masks along with the original color images are shown in Fig. 4C.

Based on the rankings of the ANN maps in terms of their peak correlations to the Human PC, we predicted that human recognition accuracy should be significantly more sensitive to the visual regions revealed by SGBP applied to the AlexNet model than those revealed by the peak maps produced by the same model using the scorecam attention method. Paired t-tests revealed a significant difference  $(p < 0.001)$  between the  $d'$  scores across models for the correct masking condition (blue bars in Fig. 4D), but revealed no significant differences in the  $d'$  scores across models for the incorrect masking condition (red bars in Fig. 4D; see Appendix for definition of  $d'$  scores). This finding confirms the prediction that human recognition accuracy is in fact significantly more sensitive to the visual regions revealed by one of the models and attention methods with the highest peak correlations to the Human PC, but less sensitive to those revealed by passive attention techniques applied to a model that yielded significantly lower peak correlations to the Human PC, even though correct masking did produce a

boost in recognition accuracy over incorrect masking for both models ( $p < 0.001$ , Fig 4D).  $d'$  scores broken down by individual images can be found in the Appendix (See SI Fig. S5).

# 6 Validation Experiment: Human visual selectivity Boosts ANN Recognition

The results of the human speeded recognition experiments suggested that we evaluate the same prediction in the opposite direction: by asking whether ANN classification performance is similarly sensitive to the visual regions revealed by the human behavioral maps. To do this, we masked images using the six different human behavioral maps (Fig. 3). As with the human recognition experiments, we evaluated if ANNs show better performance with classifying correctly masked images rather than incorrectly masked images. Furthermore, we tested whether ANNs show improvements when the correct masks were obtained from the behavioral measures that had the highest peak correlations to the ANN maps (Fig. 3).

Masking procedure. We used the exact same procedure outlined in Section 5 to combine the masks and images, except that we used RGB images instead of grayscale to minimize distribution shift for ANNs. Nonetheless, these masked images look significantly different from unmasked ones (see Fig. 4), representing a significant distribution shift from the ImageNet and CIFAR-100 datasets the ANN models were trained on. We anticipated that this distribution shift would likely reduce classification accuracy overall. We therefore consider the difference in accuracy when either correctly or incorrectly masked images are presented to the model. We generated 24 different incorrectly masked images by circularly permuting the masks over the images, giving a total of  $25 \times 25$  masked images.

Measuring recognition. In this experiment, we evaluated how masking affects ANN recognition directly. We therefore used the agent's classification on the original unmasked image as a baseline, and then compared it to classification on the corresponding masked image. Similar classifications in both cases would indicate good performance. We measured this 'similarity' across classifications as follows. For a given ANN, we took the top-1 category for the unmasked image, and computed its rank in the masked image  $(r)$ . We then divided this rank by the total number of categories  $(N)$  to normalize for differences in the number of categories across ImageNet and CIFAR-100 trained models. This new quantity  $(r / N)$  inversely tracks recognition quality: it is lower when recognition is good, and higher when recognition is poor. To convert it into a measure that directly tracks recognition, we inverted it to give our final measure  $N / r$ . We refer to this as the inverse-rank and computed it for all masked images.

Results. We computed the inverse-rank across all models, for all types of human maps (Section 2) as well as for both kinds of masking (correct, incorrect). We found that the correctly masked images are universally more recognizable (have higher inverse-rank) than incorrectly masked images, across each of the different human maps, Fig. 3,  $p < 0.001$ . This finding validates our core prediction that ANNs should be sensitive to visual regions revealed by the human measures.

Masked images were also more or less easy to recognize based on the human map type, and we found a significant main effect of behavioral map type on the overall inverse-rank  $(\mathrm{F}(5,50) = 22.36 p < 0.001)$ . We also found a significant interaction between masking condition (correct vs. incorrect) and map type, indicating that different human behavioral maps have a direct impact on recognizability (the difference in inverse-rank between the correct and incorrect masking conditions  $(\mathrm{F}(5,50) = 7.67 p < 0.001)$ ). This finding is key, because it confirms a change in recognition performance that is predicted from the differences in overall peak correlations of the ANN maps to the different human maps. Like the interaction we observed with the human recognition experiment, it shows that behavioral measures that had higher peak correlations to the ANN maps (like the patch ratings maps) also gave high inverse-rank scores, while others, like the KDE maps score, were lower on both accounts. More details of the analysis and results can be found in Appendix Fig. S6.

# 7 Discussion

Using a range of human behavioral measures and ANN attention techniques (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), we attempted a comprehensive examination of the similarities and differences between humans and machines with respect to their visual selectivity to image information. We found positive correlations between ANN and human maps (Fig. 3). This is due to the fact that ANN maps are optimally predictive of a latent human visual selectivity feature (Human PC; see Fig. 3) that captures

Figure 5: ANN recognition results. A. Measuring recognition. As outlined in the text, we directly evaluate how masks derived from human maps affect ANN recognition by examining how the rank of the top image category prediction when classifying an unmasked image changes when that same image is masked with either the correct or incorrect mask. B. Inverse-rank across different human maps grouped by correct vs incorrect masking, averaged across all ANN models and images. All human maps give a higher inverse-rank for correct vs incorrect masking, validating the main hypothesis that ANNs are sensitive to visual regions highlighted by human maps. We also find an interaction in the predicted direction: the effect of correct masking was greater when maps were from the behavioral results that were the most highly correlated to the ANN maps overall.

the maximal shared variability across human behavioral maps. Surprisingly, simple architectures and passive attention techniques showed the peak correlations to the human data, and performed significantly better than the maps produced by several active attention and state-of-the-art models (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the same visual regions are informative to humans and machines. We further validated this by running two additional experiments. In the first, we took the ANN data and used it to mask images presented to human participants. We found that humans were better at classifying images that were masked with the correct ANN map compared with incorrect maps, and that the difference in performance between these two conditions was greater when the ANN maps used were more highly correlated to the Human PC maps (Fig. 4). In the second experiment, we used human maps to mask images and measured the effect on recognition performance for the ANN models. Again, we found that incorrect masking was more destructive to the ANN recognition performance than correct masking (Fig. 1). We also found that the change in performance between the two conditions was greater when the masking was done using human maps that were the most highly correlated to the ANN maps.

Our results suggest that the regions that are discovered by attention techniques in both humans and ANNs are indeed mutually important for recognition. The main limitation of this work is the inclusion of a relatively small number of images. This is because of the large number of participants needed in order to create detailed estimates for all the behavioral maps for each of the images (requiring over a hundred participants for every image). In addition, further work will be required to fully explain why artificial and human visual selectivity maps overlap. In addition, while making artificial networks more human-like has practical advantages for improving their interpretability, pitfalls include introducing potentially harmful human biases (ranging from perceptual biases [29] to racial biases [36]). Further work should develop ways to protect against introducing these kinds of biases into these systems. Overall, our results pave the way for developing new psychologically relevant benchmarks for evaluating leading ANN models, beyond comparing them to the neural basis of biological vision, or the distributions of their learned representations to the structure of human psychological representations. These results showcase new ways of combining the perspectives of machine learning and cognitive science towards developing more human-like intelligent systems.
