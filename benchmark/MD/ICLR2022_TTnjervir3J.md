# ABSTRACT

Training action space selection for reinforcement learning (RL) is conflict-prone due to complex state-action relationships. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Shapely-inspired methodology for training action space categorization and ranking. To reduce exponential-time Shapely computations, the methodology includes a Monte Carlo simulation to avoid unnecessary explorations. The effectiveness of the methodology is illustrated using a cloud infrastructure resource tuning case study. It reduces the search space by  $80\%$  and categorizes the training action sets into dispensable and indispensable groups. Additionally, it ranks different training actions to facilitate superior RL model performance and lower cost. The proposed data-driven methodology is extensible to different domains, use cases, and machine learning algorithms.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A reinforcement learning (RL) agent learns how to map situations to actions in order to maximize a long-term cumulative award signal in a given environment. Figure 1 shows the various artifacts of an RL algorithm. An RL problem is defined by a quartet of  $(S, A, P_a, R_a)$ , where  $S$  is a set of states or the state space;  $A$  is a set of actions or the action space available to influence  $S$ ;  $P_a(s, s') = Pr(s_{t+1} = s'|s_t = s, a_t = a)$  is the transition probability which is the probability that action  $a$  in state  $s$  at time  $t$  will lead to state  $s'$  at time  $t+1$ ; and finally,  $R_a(s, s')$  is the immediate reward signal received after transitioning from state  $s$  to state  $s'$ , due to action  $a$ . An RL agent training involves recognizing an optimal policy function from a corpus of  $\{(s_i, a_i)\}$ . The reward function,  $R_a$ , is defined as initio for an efficient goal accomplishment. The transition probability or state-action mapping is defined by the environment dynamics. In many real-life use cases, the agent cannot directly sense the effect of its actions on the environment. This is particularly true when the state-action relationship cannot be modeled by either closed-form analytical expressions [23, 25, 51] or explicit rules as in the popular games such as Chess [24], Go [41, 40], and Atari [30]. This challenge is well documented in the literature [44, 50]. To address this challenge for RL model training [45, 29], simulation-based action models [43] play a pivotal role. The optimal choice of simulation parameters such as the training action space is a non-trivial challenge because of the curse of dimensionality [15] and non-linearity [11].

Training data valuation [20, 10] and associated artisanal software engineering efforts constitute a large part of the machine learning (ML) life cycle (or MLOps). Yet, most research and development efforts [32] focus on algorithms and infrastructure. Production-grade MLOps needs to handle data lifecycle management (DLM) [36] challenges including: fairness and bias in labeled datasets [14], data quality [9], limitations of benchmarks [38], and reproducibility concerns [35]. For RL, the DLM challenges are further compounded due to complexities arising from non-linear state-action interactions, partially-observable processes, non-isometric action spaces [28], and strong domain specificity [19] of action models. With the recent emphasis on ML explainability, traditional supervised learning and deep learning research communities are actively working on systematic data-driven frameworks [13, 46] for training data valuation. We need equivalent frameworks for RL to streamline conflict-prone training action selection [8, 33, 16]. Depending on the agent-environment interactions, different training actions have different relative contributions to the RL agent performance. Some training actions are indispensable because of their unique positions in the parametric space. Other dispensable actions have different relative contributions to the reward function. Remarkably, a high-cardinality training action space in many cases leads to lower cumulative reward than a well-designed training

action space. To the best of authors' knowledge, there is hardly any data-driven tool for the evaluation of training action space for RL. Such a tool leads to superior RL agent performance, lower model training and maintenance cost, and strong multi-disciplinary collaboration [31].

This paper proposes a Shapely-inspired [47] algorithm to categorize and rank training action sets. It also assists in recognizing cut-off cardinality for the training action space to reduce unnecessary exploration and ensure polynomial time complexity. Additionally, a gradient-based action update rule is proposed for faster convergence for the RL loop. While Section 2 describes the algorithms for RL training action space evaluation, Section 3 illustrates the effectiveness of the algorithms in a specific case study. Finally, Section 4 present a succinct summary with possible future directions.

# 2 ALGORITHM

In RL agent design, training action selection is a conflict-prone process. This paper offers data-driven tools for streamlining RL training action selection. We present a Shapely-inspired algorithm [42], as shown in Algorithm 1, for optimal training action selection. The algorithm uncovers the indispensability of some training action sets for a given RL task. A training action set is deemed to be indispensable iff upon removal of that training action set the RL agent fails to accomplish the goal within a finite number of steps [22, 49, 21],  $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$  ( $\epsilon$  is error limit for the ML model for the environment,  $\mathcal{F}$ ), and/or without escaping the parametric action boundary. On the other hand, the algorithm computes the cumulative reward for a given initial starting action,  $a_0$ , for each dispensable training action set. The cumulative reward can be used as a quantitative measure for the utility of a training action set for the given initial action,  $a_0$  and could be used as a basis for ranking different training action sets.

As a Shapely-inspired algorithm, the cardinality of the training action set is a critical design consideration because the possible action space grows exponentially with the number of training actions. To address this computational issue, Algorithm 2 uses a truncated Monte Carlo method to compute a cut-off cardinality value and reduces unnecessary exploration.

Another important consideration is the step size for the action update. It is a conflict-prone design decision: while a small action update step leads to prohibitively slow convergence, a large action update step causes divergence. For a multi-dimensional non-isometric action space, the problem becomes more complicated because the movements in different action directions bring non-uniform cumulative rewards. Algorithm 3 proposes a computational procedure for optimal step-size for action update.

# 3 CASE STUDY

In this section, we design a resource tuning example (in the cloud) to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the training action space evaluation. We evaluate the performance of an MDP [18]-based RL agent, as shown in Figure 1. The state-action mapping and transition probability are modeled using time-series auto-regression [34] after a PCA-based dimensionality reduction [37] with time complexity  $\mathcal{O}(klogk)$ , where  $k$  is the number of principal components. The choice of the

Output: Categorization vector,  $\mathcal{V}$ , for different training actions for a given initial action,  $a_0$ , and a parametric action boundary. It takes two different categorical values: {dispensable, indispensable}. Also, rank dispensable training actions based on their cumulative rewards.

algorithms is purely driven by the nature of the training dataset. A more complex non-linear dataset warrants more complex sequential models such as long short-term memory (LSTM) [39] or attention based models [26]. For action updates, WLOG, an RL-based PID controller [1, 12] is used. Similar to time-series modeling, action update can be conducted by other policy learning algorithms such as SARSA [17].

As shown in Table 1, the objective of the RL agent for this case study is to quickly reduce high CPU utilization below a pre-assigned threshold for a given workload. In most infrastructure/cloud resource tuning technologies [48], CPU utilization represents a key metric. Therefore, the state space for this RL case study consists of virtual machine CPU utilization (\%) metrics and the action space is defined by the VM resource set points, i.e., (# of vCPUs, Memory Size (GB)). The RL agent uses AWS goto3 SDK [2] to manipulate actions and AWS CloudWatch [3] for state space monitoring. The reward is defined as the number of time steps required by the agent to accomplish the objective multiplied by  $-1$ . The negative reward per time step was meant to push the agent to accomplish the task as fast as possible.

The training data for this case study was generated internally [4] with an open source library, stress (https://linux.die.net/man/1/stress). It uses a rectangular workload. The peak of the workload uses the stress command: sudo stress -io 4 -vm 2 -vm-bytes 1024M -timeout 500s. Essentially, the peak is running  $4\mathrm{I} / \mathrm{O}$  stressors and 2 VM workers spinning on malloc with 1024 MB per worker for 500 s. The simulated rectangular workload has a time period of  $600~\mathrm{s}$ : a high-stress phase of  $500~\mathrm{s}$  is followed by an inactive phase of  $100~\mathrm{s}$ . The RL training action space is spanned by the power set drawn from the five pairs of EC2 configuration set points as shown in Table 2. Using Algorithm 2, we notice that the power set below the cut-off cardinality of 4 produces trivial and unstable results. Therefore, WLOG, the analysis in this paper has been focused on six training action sets as shown in Table 4. That amounts to  $81.25\%$  reduction in the search space. For each EC2 instance in the training action space, the corresponding state metrics, i.e., CPU utilization (\%) are shown in Figure 2. The

training data was collected for a 24 hour period with 1 minute sampling interval. Using Algorithm 3, the optimal step-size for action update is identified to be 0.1 in both # of vCPUs and Memory Size (GB) dimensions.

With this set up, different RL models are developed with different training action sets and the corresponding rewards and ranks are noted in Table 4. Remarkably, a high cardinality training action set does not guarantee the best reward: the agent with all training actions,  $\langle \text{small } t3a, \text{ medium } t3a, \text{ large } t3a, \text{ xlarge } t3a, 2xlarge t3a \rangle$ , does not yield the highest reward. In fact, the action set with  $\langle \text{medium } t3a, \text{ large } t3a, \text{ xlarge } t3a, 2xlarge t3a \rangle$  yields the highest reward. This pattern could be attributed to the state-action interaction in this particular case study. First, the parametric distances between different EC2 instance pairs are not uniform. While the Euclidean distance between small  $t3a$  and medium  $t3a$  is equal to 2, that between  $xlarge t3a$  and  $2xlarge t3a$  is 16.5. The non-uniform spacing for training action space is a considerable deterrent [27] for RL adoption. Second, in this case study, the transient CPU utilization (\%) patterns have undergone a material change from  $xlarge t3a$  (max  $100\%$ ) to  $2xlarge t3a$  (max  $73\%$ ). This indicates the strong influence of  $2xlarge t3a$  for the given RL task. Indeed, we noticed  $2xlarge t3a$  to be an indispensable training action. As shown in Table 3, a categorization of training actions can be inferred based on the valuation vector,  $\mathcal{V}$ , as described in Algorithm 1: two dispensable training actions are uncovered to be small  $t3a$ , medium  $t3a$  and three indispensable training actions to be large  $t3a$ ,  $xlarge t3a$ ,  $2xlarge t3a$ .

Figure 3 shows the RL loop action with three training actions: <small t3a, medium t3a, large t3a, xlarge t3a, 2xlarge t3a>, <medium t3a, large t3a, xlarge t3a, 2xlarge t3a>, and <small t3a, large t3a, xlarge t3a, 2xlarge t3a>.

- For the first training action set of  $<$ small t3a, medium t3a, large t3a, xlarge t3a, 2xlarge t3a>, the reward is  $-21$ . The left subplot in Figure 3(a) shows how the recommended action is evolving with time from an arbitrary initial point of (6, 14). The recommended points are superimposed on the training action parameter space to illustrate their relative position with respect to the parametric boundary which is defined by the trapezium with vertices:  $\{(2,2), (2,8), (8,32), (8,2)\}$  in the (# of vCPUs, Memory Size (GB)) space. The right subplot in Figure 3(a) shows how the median CPU utilization (\%) comes below the  $90\%$  threshold in 21 steps leading to  $-21$  in reward. The blue dots represent the median CPU utilizations for different training set points.  
- For the second training action set of  $\langle \text{medium} t3a, \text{large} t3a, x\text{large} t3a, 2x\text{large} t3a \rangle$ , the reward is -13 as shown in Figure 3(b).  
- For the third training action set of  $<$ small t3a, large t3a, xlarge t3a, 2xlarge t3a>, the reward is  $-16$  as shown in Figure 3(c).

Figure 2: CPU utilization  $(\%)$  responses on five different EC2 instances (Table 2) from 2PM-UTC 9/1/2021-2PM-UTC 9/2/2021 at 1 minute granularity. This training data was generated internally [4]. The median CPU utilization values  $(\%)$  are noted to be equal to  $\{95\%, 95.5\%, 99.5\%, 100\%, 72.5\}$

As shown in Table 4, the reward scores can indeed be used for ranking different training action sets leading to a data-driven approach for training action selection. As shown in Figure 4, large  $t3a$  is an indispensable element in the training action space for the given RL agent. Without this training action, the RL agent fails to accomplish the goal of bringing the CPU utilization below the critical threshold. Similar observations can be made about  $xlarge t3a$  and  $2xlarge t3a$ .

# 4 CONCLUSION

This paper proposes a data-driven methodology for training action space evaluation for RL. The methodology offers a principled framework for training action space categorization and ranking within a finite computational time. It unleashes a strategy for superior model performance and lower modeling cost. Additionally, the proposed methodology is completely agnostic of use cases and machine learning algorithms. Therefore, it is a general-purpose methodology extensible to different domains including distributed computing, network traffic control, healthcare, automatic locomotion, building management system, and industrial controls, and different machine learning algorithms such as PCA, Autoencoder, ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, PID, SARSA, DQN, and many others.

Figure 4: RL loop with <small t3a, medium t3a, xlarge t3a, 2xlarge t3a> action space. The agent could never accomplish the goal, therefore, large t3a is an indispensable element in the training action space. Similarly, xlarge t3a and 2xlarge t3a are two indispensable elements in the training action space.

next phase of the development for this data-agnostic methodology, we are planning to contribute a general RL design library to relevant open source projects [5, 6, 7].
