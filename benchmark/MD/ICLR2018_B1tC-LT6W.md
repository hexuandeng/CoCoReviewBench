# ABSTRACT

We propose and evaluate new techniques for compressing and speeding up dense matrix multiplications as found in the fully connected and recurrent layers of neural networks for embedded large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). For compression, we introduce and study a trace norm regularization technique for training low rank factored versions of matrix multiplications. Compared to standard low rank training, we show that our method leads to good accuracy versus number of parameter trade-offs and can be used to speed up training of large models. For speedup, we enable faster inference on ARM processors through new open sourced kernels optimized for small batch sizes, resulting in 3x to 7x speed ups over the widely used gemmlowp library. Beyond LVCSR, we expect our techniques and kernels to be more generally applicable to embedded neural networks with large fully connected or recurrent layers.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

For embedded applications of machine learning, we seek models that are as accurate as possible given constraints on size and on latency at inference time. For many neural networks, the parameters and computation are concentrated in two basic building blocks:

1. Convolutions. These tend to dominate in, for example, image processing applications.  
2. Dense matrix multiplications (GEMMs) as found, for example, inside fully connected layers or recurrent layers such as GRU and LSTM. These are common in speech and natural language processing applications.

These two building blocks are the natural targets for efforts to reduce parameters and speed up models for embedded applications. Much work on this topic already exists in the literature. For a brief overview, see Section 2.

In this paper, we focus only on dense matrix multiplications and not on convolutions. Our two main contributions are:

1. Trace norm regularization: We describe a trace norm regularization technique and an accompanying training methodology that enables the practical training of models with competitive accuracy versus number of parameter trade-offs. It automatically selects the rank and eliminates the need for any prior knowledge on suitable matrix rank.  
2. Efficient kernels for inference: We explore the importance of optimizing for low batch sizes in on-device inference, and we introduce kernels<sup>1</sup> for ARM processors that vastly outperform publicly available kernels in the low batch size regime.

These two topics are discussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Although we conducted our experiments and report results in the context of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) on embedded devices, the ideas and techniques are broadly applicable to other deep learning networks. Work on compressing any neural network for which large GEMMs dominate the parameters or computation time could benefit from the insights presented in this paper.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Our work is most closely related to that of Prabhavalkar et al. (2016), where low rank factored acoustic speech models are similarly trained by initializing weights from a truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) of pretrained weight matrices. This technique was also applied to speech recognition on mobile devices (McGraw et al., 2016; Xue et al., 2013). We build on this method by adding a variational form of trace norm regularization that was first proposed for collaborative prediction (Srebro et al., 2005) and also applied to recommender systems (Karen et al., 2009). The use of this technique with gradient descent was recently justified theoretically (Ciliberto et al., 2017). Furthermore, Neyshabur et al. (2015) argue that trace norm regularization could provide a sensible inductive bias for neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine the training technique of Prabhavalkar et al. (2016) with variational trace norm regularization.

Low rank factorization of neural network weights in general has been the subject of many other works (Denil et al., 2013; Sainath et al., 2013; Ba & Caruana, 2014; Kuchaiev & Ginsburg, 2017). Some other approaches for dense matrix compression include sparsity (LeCun et al., 1989; Narang et al., 2017), hash-based parameter sharing (Chen et al., 2015), and other parameter-sharing schemes such as circulant, Toeplitz, or more generally low-displacement-rank matrices (Sindhwani et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016). Kuchaiev & Ginsburg (2017) explore splitting activations into independent groups. Doing so is akin to using block-diagonal matrices.

The techniques for compressing convolutional models are different and beyond the scope of this paper. We refer the interested reader to, e.g., Denton et al. (2014); Han et al. (2016); Iandola et al. (2016) and references therein.

# 3 TRAINING LOW RANK MODELS

Low rank factorization is a well studied and effective technique for compressing large matrices. In Prabhavalkar et al. (2016), low rank models are trained by first training a model with unfactored weight matrices (we refer to this as stage 1), and then initializing a model with factored weight matrices from the truncated SVD of the unfactored model (we refer to this as warmstarting a stage 2 model from a stage 1 model). The truncation is done by retaining only as many singular values as required to explain a specified percentage of the variance.

If the weight matrices from stage 1 had only a few nonzero singular values, then the truncated SVD used for warmstarting stage 2 would yield a much better or even error-free approximation of the stage 1 matrix. This suggests applying a sparsity-inducing  $\ell^1$  penalty on the vector of singular values during stage 1 training. This is known as trace norm regularization in the literature. Unfortunately, there is no known way of directly computing the trace norm and its gradients that would be computationally feasible in the context of large deep learning models. Instead, we propose to combine the two-stage training method of Prabhavalkar et al. (2016) with an indirect variational trace norm regularization technique (Srebro et al., 2005; Ciliberto et al., 2017). We describe this technique in more detail in Section 3.1 and report experimental results in Section 3.2.

# 3.1 TRACE NORM REGULARIZATION

First we introduce some notation. Let us denote by  $||\cdot ||_{\mathcal{T}}$  the trace norm of a matrix, that is, the sum of the singular values of the matrix. The trace norm is also referred to as the nuclear norm or the Schatten 1-norm in the literature. Furthermore, let us denote by  $||\cdot ||_{\mathcal{F}}$  the Frobenius norm of a matrix, defined as

$$
\left| \left| A \right| \right| _ {\mathcal {F}} = \sqrt {\operatorname {T r} A A ^ {*}} = \sqrt {\sum_ {i , j} \left| A _ {i j} \right| ^ {2}}. \tag {1}
$$

The Frobenius norm is identical to the Schatten 2-norm of a matrix, i.e. the  $\ell^2$  norm of the singular value vector of the matrix. The following lemma provides a variational characterization of the trace norm in terms of the Frobenius norm.

Lemma 1 (Jameson (1987); Ciliberto et al. (2017)). Let  $W$  be an  $m \times n$  matrix and denote by  $\sigma$  its vector of singular values. Then

$$
\left| \left| W \right| \right| _ {\mathcal {T}} := \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\min  (m, n)} \sigma_ {i} (W) = \min  \frac {1}{2} \left(\left| \left| U \right| \right| _ {\mathcal {F}} ^ {2} + \left| \left| V \right| \right| _ {\mathcal {F}} ^ {2}\right), \tag {2}
$$

where the minimum is taken over all  $U: m \times \min(m, n)$  and  $V: \min(m, n) \times n$  such that  $W = UV$ . Furthermore, if  $W = \tilde{U} \Sigma \tilde{V}^*$  is a singular value decomposition of  $W$ , then equality holds in (2) for the choice  $U = \tilde{U} \sqrt{\Sigma}$  and  $V = \sqrt{\Sigma} \tilde{V}^*$ .

The procedure to take advantage of this characterization is as follows. First, for each large GEMM in the model, replace the  $m \times n$  weight matrix  $W$  by the product  $W = UV$  where  $U: m \times \min(m, n)$  and  $V: \min(m, n) \times n$ . Second, replace the original loss function  $\ell(W)$  by

$$
\ell (U V) + \frac {1}{2} \lambda \left(\| U \| _ {\mathcal {F}} ^ {2} + \| V \| _ {\mathcal {F}} ^ {2}\right). \tag {3}
$$

where  $\lambda$  is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the approximate trace norm regularization. Proposition 1 in Ciliberto et al. (2017) guarantees that minimizing the modified loss equation (3) is equivalent to minimizing the actual trace norm regularized loss:

$$
\ell (W) + \lambda \| W \| _ {\mathcal {T}}. \tag {4}
$$

In Section 3.2.1 we show empirically that use of the modified loss (3) is indeed highly effective at reducing the trace norm of the weight matrices.

To summarize, we propose the following basic training scheme:

# - Stage 1:

- For each large GEMM in the model, replace the  $m \times n$  weight matrix  $W$  by the product  $W = UV$  where  $U: m \times r$ ,  $V: r \times n$ , and  $r = \min(m, n)$ .

- Replace the original loss function  $\ell(W)$  by

$$
\ell (U V) + \frac {1}{2} \lambda \left(\| U \| _ {\mathcal {F}} ^ {2} + \| V \| _ {\mathcal {F}} ^ {2}\right), \tag {5}
$$

where  $\lambda$  is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the trace norm regularization.

- Train the model to convergence.

# - Stage 2:

- For the trained model from stage 1, recover  $W = UV$  by multiplying the two trained matrices  $U$  and  $V$ .  
- Train low rank models warmstarted from the truncated SVD of  $W$ . By varying the number of singular values retained, we can control the parameter versus accuracy trade-off.

One modification to this is described in Section 3.2.3, where we show that it is actually not necessary to train the stage 1 model to convergence before switching to stage 2. By making the transition earlier, training time can be substantially reduced.

# 3.2 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

We report here the results of our experiments related to trace norm regularization. Our baseline model is a forward-only Deep Speech 2 model, and we train and evaluate on the widely used Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speech corpus. Except for a few minor modifications described in Appendix B, we follow closely the original paper describing this architecture (Amodei et al., 2016), and we refer the reader to that paper for details on the inputs, outputs, exact layers used, training methodology, and so on. For the purposes of this paper, suffice it to say that the parameters and computation are dominated by three GRU layers and a fully connected layer. It is these four layers that we compress through low-rank factorization. As described in Appendix B.2, in our factorization scheme, each

GRU layer involves two matrix multiplications: a recurrent and a non-recurrent one. For a simple recurrent layer, we would write

$$
h _ {t} = f \left(W _ {\text {n o n r e c}} x _ {t} + W _ {\text {r e c}} h _ {t - 1}\right). \tag {6}
$$

For a GRU layer, there are also weights for reset and update gates, which we group with the recurrent matrix. See Appendix B.2 for details and the motivation for this split.

Since our work focuses only on compressing acoustic models and not language models, the error metric we report is the character error rate (CER) rather than word error rate (WER). As the size and latency constraints vary widely across devices, whenever possible we compare techniques by comparing their accuracy versus number of parameter trade-off curves. All CERs reported here are computed on a validation set separate from the training set.

# 3.2.1 STAGE 1 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we investigate the effects of training with the modified loss function in (3). For simplicity, we refer to this as trace norm regularization.

As the WSJ corpus is relatively small at around 80 hours of speech, models tend to benefit substantially from regularization. To make comparisons more fair, we also trained unfactored models with an  $\ell^2$  regularization term and searched the hyperparameter space just as exhaustively.

For both trace norm and  $\ell^2$  regularization, we found it beneficial to introduce separate  $\lambda_{rec}$  and  $\lambda_{nonrec}$  parameters for determining the strength of regularization for the recurrent and non-recurrent weight matrices, respectively. In addition to  $\lambda_{rec}$  and  $\lambda_{nonrec}$  in initial experiments, we also roughly tuned the learning rate. Since the same learning rate was found to be optimal for nearly all experiments, we just used that for all the experiments reported in this section. The dependence of final CER on  $\lambda_{rec}$  and  $\lambda_{nonrec}$  is shown in Figure 1. Separate  $\lambda_{rec}$  and  $\lambda_{nonrec}$  values are seen to help for both trace norm and  $\ell^2$  regularization. However, for trace norm regularization, it appears better to fix  $\lambda_{rec}$  as a multiple of  $\lambda_{nonrec}$  rather than tuning the two parameters independently.

The first question we are interested in is whether our modified loss (3) is really effective at reducing the trace norm. As we are interested in the relative concentration of singular values rather than their absolute magnitudes, we introduce the following nondimensional metric.

Definition 1. Let  $W$  be a nonzero  $m \times n$  matrix with  $d = \min(m, n) \geq 2$ . Denote by  $\sigma$  the  $d$ -dimensional vector of singular values of  $W$ . Then we define the nondimensional trace norm coefficient of  $W$  as follows:

$$
\nu (W) := \frac {\frac {\| \sigma \| _ {\ell 1}}{\| \sigma \| _ {\ell 2}} - 1}{\sqrt {d} - 1}. \tag {7}
$$

Figure 3: The truncated SVD rank required to explain  $90\%$  of the variance of the weight matrix versus CER by type of regularization used during training. Shown here are results for the non-recurrent (left) and recurrent (right) weights of the third GRU layer. The plots for the other weights are similar.

We show in Appendix A that  $\nu$  is scale-invariant and ranges from 0 for rank 1 matrices to 1 for maximal-rank matrices with all singular values equal. Intuitively, the smaller  $\nu(W)$ , the better  $W$  can be approximated by a low rank matrix.

As shown in Figure 2, trace norm regularization is indeed highly effective at reducing the nondimensional trace norm coefficient compared to  $\ell^2$  regularization. At very high regularization strengths,  $\ell^2$  regularization also leads to small  $\nu$  values. However, from Figure 1 it is apparent that this comes at the expense of relatively high CERs. As shown in Figure 3, this translates into requiring a much lower rank for the truncated SVD to explain, say,  $90\%$  of the variance of the weight matrix for a given CER. Although a few  $\ell^2$ -regularized models occasionally achieve low rank, we observe this only at relatively high CER's and only for some of the weights. Note also that some form of regularization is very important on this dataset. The unregularized baseline model (the green points in Figure 3) achieves relatively low CER.

# 3.2.2 STAGE 2 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we report the results of stage 2 experiments warmstarted from either trace norm or  $L^2$  regularized stage 1 models.

For each regularization type, we took the three best stage 1 models (in terms of final CER: all were below 6.8) and used the truncated SVD of their weights to initialize the weights of stage 2 models. By varying the threshold of variance explained for the SVD truncation, each stage 1 model

resulted into multiple stage 2 models. The stage 2 models were trained without regularization (i.e.,  $\lambda_{rec} = \lambda_{nonrec} = 0$ ) and with the initial learning rate set to three times the final learning rate of the stage 1 model.

As shown in Figure 4, the best models from either trace norm or  $L^2$  regularization exhibit similar accuracy versus number of parameter trade-offs. For comparison, we also warmstarted some stage 2 models from an unregularized stage 1 model. These models are seen to have significantly lower accuracies, accentuating the need for regularization on the WSJ corpus.

# 3.2.3 REDUCING TRAINING TIME

In the previous sections, we trained the stage 1 models for 40 epochs to full convergence and then trained the stage 2 models for another 40 epochs, again to full convergence. Since the stage 2 models are drastically smaller than the stage 1 models, it takes less time to train them. Hence, shifting the stage 1 to stage 2 transition point to an earlier epoch could substantially reduce training time. In this section, we show that it is indeed possible to do so without hurting final accuracy.

Specifically, we took the stage 1 trace norm and  $\ell^2$  models from Section 3.2.1 that resulted in the best stage 2 models in Section 3.2.2. In that section, we were interested in the parameters vs accuracy trade-off and used each stage 1 model to warmstart a number of stage 2 models of different sizes. In this section, we instead set a fixed target of  $3\mathrm{M}$  parameters and a fixed overall training budget of 80 epochs but vary the stage 1 to stage 2 transition epoch. For each of the stage 2 runs, we initialize the learning rate with the learning rate of the stage 1 model at the transition epoch. So the learning rate follows the same schedule as if we had trained a single model for 80 epochs. As before, we disable all regularization for stage 2.

The  $\ell^2$  stage 1 model has  $21.7\mathrm{M}$  parameters, whereas the trace norm stage 1 model at  $29.8\mathrm{M}$  parameters is slightly larger due to the factorization. Since the stage 2 models have roughly  $3\mathrm{M}$  parameters and the training time is approximately proportional to the number of parameters, stage 2 models train about  $7\mathrm{x}$  and  $10\mathrm{x}$  faster, respectively, than the  $\ell^2$  and trace norm stage 1 models. Consequently, large overall training time reductions can be achieved by reducing the number of epochs spent in stage 1 for both  $\ell^2$  and trace norm.

The results are shown in Figure 5. Based on the left panel, it is evident that we can lower the transition epoch number without hurting the final CER. In some cases, we even see marginal CER improvements. For transition epochs of at least 15, we also see slightly better results for trace norm than  $\ell^2$ . In the right panel, we plot the convergence of CER when the transition epoch is 15. We find that the trace norm model's CER is barely impacted by the transition whereas the  $\ell^2$  models see a

huge jump in CER at the transition epoch. Furthermore, the plot suggests that a total of 60 epochs may have sufficed. However, the savings from reducing stage 2 epochs are negligible compared to the savings from reducing the transition epoch.

# 4 APPLICATION TO PRODUCTION-GRADE EMBEDDED SPEECH RECOGNITION

With low rank factorization techniques similar² to those described in Section 3, we were able to train large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) models with acceptable numbers of parameters and acceptable loss of accuracy compared to a production server model (baseline). Table 1 shows the baseline along with three different compressed models with much lower number of parameters. The tier-3 model employs the techniques of Sections B.4 and B.3. Consequently, it runs significantly faster than the tier-1 model, even though they have a similar number of parameters. Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of some loss in accuracy.

Although low rank factorization significantly reduces the overall computational complexity of our LVCSR system, we still require further optimization to achieve real-time inference on mobile or embedded devices. One approach to speeding up the network is to use low-precision 8-bit integer representations for weight matrices and matrix multiplications (the GEMM operation in BLAS terminology). This type of quantization after training reduces both memory as well as computation requirements of the network while only introducing  $2\%$  to  $4\%$  relative increase in WER. Quantization for embedded speech recognition has also been previously studied in (Alvarez et al., 2016; Vanhoucke et al., 2011), and it may be possible to reduce the relative WER increase by quantizing the forward passes during training (Alvarez et al., 2016). As the relative WER losses from compressing the acoustic and language models were much larger for us, we did not pursue this further for the present study.

All matrices are in unsigned 8-bit integer format.

To perform low precision matrix multiplications, we originally used the gemmlowp library, which provides state-of-the-art low precision GEMMs using unsigned 8-bit integer values (Jacob & Warden, 2015-2017). However, gemmlowp's approach is not efficient for small batch sizes. Our application, LVCSR on embedded devices with single user, is dominated by low batch size GEMMs due to the sequential nature of recurrent layers and latency constraints. This can be demonstrated by looking at a simple RNN cell which has the form:

$$
h _ {t} = f \left(W x _ {t} + U h _ {t - 1}\right) \tag {8}
$$

This cell contains two main GEMMs: The first,  $Uh_{t-1}$ , is sequential and requires a GEMM with batch size 1. The second,  $Wx_{t}$ , can in principle be performed at higher batch sizes by batching across time. However, choosing a too large batch sizes can significantly delay the output, as the system needs to wait for more future context. In practice, we found that batch sizes higher than around 4 resulted in too high latencies, negatively impacting user experience.

This motivated us to implement custom assembly kernels for the 64-bit ARM architecture (AArch64, also known as ARMv8 or ARM64) to further improve the performance of the GEMMs operations. We do not go through the methodological details in this paper. Instead, we are making the kernels and implementation details available at https://github.com/paddlepaddle/farm.

Figure 6 compares the performance of our implementation (denoted by farm) with the gemmlowp library for matrix multiplication on iPhone 7, iPhone 6, and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. The farm kernels are significantly faster than their gemmlowp counterparts for batch sizes 1 to 4. The peak single-core theoretical performance for iPhone 7, iPhone 6, and Raspberry Pi 3 are 56.16, 22.4 and 9.6 Giga Operations per Second, respectively. The gap between the theoretical and achieved values are mostly due to kernels being limited by memory bandwidth. For a more detailed analysis, we refer to the farm website.

In addition to low precision representation and customized ARM kernels, we explored other approaches to speed up our LVCSR system. These techniques are described in Appendix B.

Finally, by combining low rank factorization, some techniques from Appendix B, int8 quantization and the farm kernels, as well as using smaller language models, we could create a range of speech recognition models suitably tailored to various devices. These are shown in Table 2.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We worked on compressing and reducing the inference latency of LVCSR speech recognition models. To better compress models, we introduced a trace norm regularization technique and demonstrated its potential for faster training of low rank models on the WSJ speech corpus. To reduce latency at inference time, we demonstrated the importance of optimizing for low batch sizes and released optimized kernels for the ARM64 platform. Finally, by combining the various techniques
