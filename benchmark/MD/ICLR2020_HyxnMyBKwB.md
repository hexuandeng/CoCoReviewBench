# ABSTRACT

We analyze the Gambler's problem, a simple reinforcement learning problem where the gambler has the chance to double or lose their bets until the target is reached. This is an early example introduced in the reinforcement learning textbook by Sutton & Barto (2018), where they mention an interesting pattern of the optimal value function with high-frequency components and repeating nonsmooth points but without further investigation. We provide the exact formula for the optimal value function for both the discrete and the continuous case. Though simple as it might seem, the value function is pathological: fractal, self-similar, non-smooth on any interval, zero derivative almost everywhere, and not written as elementary functions. Sharing these properties with the Cantor function, it holds a complexity that has been uncharted thus far. With the analysis, our work could lead insights on improving value function approximation, Q-learning, and gradient-based algorithms in real applications and implementations.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

We analytically investigate a deceptively simple problem, the Gambler's problem, introduced in the reinforcement learning textbook by Sutton & Barto (2018), on Example 4.3, Chapter 4 page 84 and is described as below. The problem presents a natural and simple setting, which would hide its attractiveness. A close inspection will show that the problem, as an representative of the entire family of Markov decision process (MDP), involves a level of complexity and curiosity uncharted in years of reinforcement learning research.

The problem discusses a gambler's casino game, where they conducts multiple rounds of betting. The gambler doubles up the bet if they wins a round or loses the bet if they loses the round. The game ends when either the gambler reaches their goal of  $N$  or running out of money. On each round, the gambler must decide what portion of the capital to stake. In the discrete setting this bet must be an integer but it can also be a real number in the continuous setting. To formulate it as an MDP, let state  $s$  be the current capital and action  $a$  the amount of bet. The reward is zero on all transitions but  $+1$  on  $s = N$ . Let  $p \geq 0.5$  be the probability that the gambler loses a round of bet.

The state-value function then gives the probability of winning from each state. Our goal is to solve the optimal value function of the problem. As a preliminary, the state-value function of an MDP with respect to policy  $\pi$  is defined as

$$
f ^ {\pi} (s) = \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t} \gamma^ {t} r _ {t} \Big | s _ {0} = s, a _ {t} \sim \pi (s _ {t}), s _ {t + 1} \sim \mathcal {T} (s _ {t}, a _ {t}), r _ {t} \sim r (s, a) \right],
$$

where  $\pi (\cdot), s_t, a_t, r_t, \mathcal{T},$  and  $\gamma$  are the policy, state, action, reward, transition kernel, and the discount factor, respectively. The state-value function and the action-state value function can induce each other so we will focus on the former for the rest of the discussion. Let  $\pi^{*}$  be one of the optimal policies,  $f^{\pi^{*}}(s)$  is then the optimal state-value function. Note this optimal value function is unique by (Sutton & Barto, 2018), despite the possible existence of multiple optimal policies.

In this paper, we first give the solution to the discrete Gambler's problem. Denote  $N$  as the target capital,  $n$  as the starting capital ( $n$  denotes the state in the discrete setting),  $p \geq 0.5$  as the probability of losing a bet, and  $\gamma$  as the discount factor. The special case of  $N = 100$ ,  $\gamma = 1$  corresponds to the original setting in Sutton and Barto's book.

Figure 1: The optimal state-value function of the discrete Gambler's problem.

Proposition 1. Let  $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$  and  $p > 0.5$ . The optimal value function  $b(n)$  is  $v(n / N)$  in the discrete setting of the Gambler's problem, where  $v(\cdot)$  is the optimal value function under the continuous case defined in Theorem 11.

The above statement is depending on our main theorem, which states the solution of the more general, continuous setting of the problem. In the continuous setting the target capital is 1, the state space is  $[0,1]$ , and the action space is  $0 < a \leq \min(s, 1 - s)]$  at state  $s$ , meaning that the bet can be any fraction of the current capital as long as the capital after winning does not exceed 1:

Theorem 11. Let  $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$  and  $p > 0.5$ . Under the continuous setting of the Gambler's problem, the optimal value function is  $v(1) = 1$  and

$$
v (s) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\infty} (1 - p) \gamma^ {i} b _ {i} \prod_ {j = 1} ^ {i - 1} ((1 - p) + (2 p - 1) b _ {j}) \tag {1}
$$

on  $0 \leq s < 1$ , where  $s = 0.b_{1}b_{2}\ldots b_{l}\ldots_{(2)}$  is the binary representation of the state  $s$ .

Next, we solve the Bellman equation of the continuous gambler's problem. In the strictly discounted setting  $0 \leq \gamma < 1$ , the solution of the Bellman equation  $f(s) = \max_{0 < a \leq \min (s, 1 - s)} (1 - p)\gamma f(s + a) + p\gamma f(s - a)$ ,  $f(0) = 0$ ,  $f(1) = 1$  is uniquely  $f(s) = v(s)$  the optimal value function.

This uniqueness does not hold in general. If the rewards are not discounted, the solution of the Bellman equation is either the value function, or a constant function larger than 1:

Theorem 18. Let  $\gamma = 1$  and  $p > 0.5$ . The solution of the Bellman equation  $f(s) = \max_{0 < a \leq \min (s, 1 - s)} (1 - p)f(s + a) + pf(s - a)$ ,  $f(0) = 0$ ,  $f(1) = 1$ , is either of

-  $f(s)$  is  $v(s)$  defined in Theorem 11, or  
-  $f(0) = 0$ ,  $f(1) = 1$ , and  $f(s) = C$  for all  $0 < s < 1$ , for some constant  $C \geq 1$ .

Under the corner case of  $\gamma = 1$ ,  $p = 0.5$  (where the gambler do not lose capital in bets in expectation), the problem involves midpoint concavity (Sierpinski, 1920a,b) and Cauchy's functional equation. The measurable function that solves the Bellman equation is uniquely  $f(s) = C' s + B'$  on  $s \in (0,1)$ , for some constants  $C' + B' \geq 1$ . Additionally, Under Axiom of Choice,  $f(s)$  can also be some non-constructive, non Lebesgue measurable function described by the Hamel basis.

Though the description of the Gambler's problem seems natural and simple, Theorem 11 shows that its simplicity is deceptive. The optimal value function presents its self-similar, fractal and non-rectifiable form, which cannot be described by any simple analytic formula. At any level of zooming-in, the value function keeps showing the same texture as itself. This can be observed in

Figure 2: The optimal state-value function of the continuous Gambler's problem.

Figure 1 and 2. With the fractal nature, the value function does not possess many of the desired properties for algorithms and analysis. Namely, the function is not continuous under  $\gamma < 1$ ; not differentiable on the dyadic rational, where any point on the dyadic rational has a left-derivative of zero and a right derivative of infinity; no local linear or Taylor expansion; cannot be approximated efficiently in polynomial many bins to the error. These properties are not desired and not expected by the recent line of reinforcement learning studies, who commonly use a neural network approximate the value function. These properties are likely to be extended to a wider range of MDPs, consider the simplicity of the Gambler's problem and the similar fractal patterns observed empirically in other reinforcement learning tasks.

Intuitive description of  $v(s)$ . All the statements above require the definition of  $v(s)$ . In fact, in this paper,  $v(s)$  is important enough such that its definition will not change with the context. The function cannot be written as a combination of the elementary functions. Nevertheless, we give a intuitive way to understand the function. The function can be regarded as generated by the following iterative process: First we fix  $v(0) = 0$  and  $v(1) = 1$ , and have

$$
v (\frac {1}{2}) = \gamma (p v (0) + (1 - p) v (1)) = (1 - p) \gamma .
$$

Here,  $v\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$  is  $\gamma$  times the weighted average of the two "neighbors"  $v(0)$  and  $v(1)$  that have been already evaluated. Further, the same operation applies to  $v\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)$  and  $v\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)$ , where

$$
v \left(\frac {1}{4}\right) = \gamma (p v (0) + (1 - p) v \left(\frac {1}{2}\right)) = (1 - p) ^ {2} \gamma^ {2},
$$

$$
v (\frac {3}{4}) = \gamma (p v (\frac {1}{2}) + (1 - p) v (1) = (1 - p) \gamma + p (1 - p) \gamma^ {2}.
$$

Repeatedly, we have  $v(\frac{1}{8}) = (1 - p)^3\gamma^3$ ,  $v(\frac{3}{8}) = (1 - p)^2\gamma^2 + p(1 - p)^2\gamma^3$ ,  $v(\frac{5}{8}) = p(1 - p)\gamma^2 + (1 - p)^2\gamma^2 + p(1 - p)^2\gamma^3$ , and  $v(\frac{7}{8}) = (1 - p)\gamma + p(1 - p)\gamma^2 + p^2(1 - p)\gamma^3$ , and so forth. This process will give the evaluation of  $v(s)$  on the dense and compact dyadic rational  $\bigcup_{\ell \geq 1} G_\ell$ , where  $G_\ell = \{k2^{-\ell} \mid k \in \{1, \ldots, 2^\ell - 1\}\}$ . With the fact that  $v(s)$  is monotonically strictly increasing, this dyadic rationals determines the function  $v(s)$  uniquely.

It can also be explained from the analytical definition of  $v(s)$  this iterative process. Starting with the first bit, a bit of 0 will not change the value, while a bit of 1 will add  $(1 - p)\gamma^i\prod_{j = 1}^{i - 1}((1 - p) + (2p - 1)b_j)$  to the value. This term can also be written as  $(1 - p)\gamma^i ((1 - p)^{\# 0\mathrm{bits}} + p^{\# 1\mathrm{bits}})$ , where the number of bits is counted over all previous bits. The value  $(1 - p)^{\# 0\mathrm{bits}} + p^{\# 1\mathrm{bits}}$  decides the gap between two neighbor existing points in the above process, when we insert a new point in the middle. This insertion corresponds to the iteration on  $G_{\ell}$  over  $\ell$

Illustrative description of  $v(s)$ . We provide high resolution plots of  $b(n)$  and  $v(s)$  in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. The non-smoothness and the self-similar fractal patterns can be clearly observed from the figures. In principle, these two functions cannot be completely illustrated as their non-smooth patterns continue indefinitely when we zoom in the figure. We have though tried to draw them at a fine enough grain where the human vision does not distinguish the context. Both the figures are by dot-plot, where the dots in then second figure is extreme dense so as it looks like a curve.

As observed in the figure,  $v(s)$  is continuous when  $\gamma = 1$  while  $v(s)$  is not continuous on infinity many points when  $\gamma < 1$ . In fact, when  $\gamma < 1$ , the function is discontinuous on the dyadic rationals  $\bigcup_{\ell \geq 1} G_{\ell}$  while continuous on its complement, as we will rigorously show later.

Self similarity. The function on  $[0, \frac{1}{2}]$  and on  $[\frac{1}{2}, 1]$  is similar with the function itself on  $[0, 1]$ . This similarity repeats to  $[0, \frac{1}{4}]$ ,  $[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}]$  and so forth. The set of fractal functions have a higher level of complexity of the elementary functions. It can lead to chaos as well. Functions described by an combination of elementary functions on  $\mathbb{R}$  has a dimension of 1. But the plotted curve of  $v(s)$  has a dimension of 1.64, according to our simulation of the box counting method.

Optimal policies. It is immediate by Theorem 11 and its lemmas that  $\pi(s) = \min(s, 1 - s)$  is one of the Blackwell optimal policies. Here Blackwell optimal is defined as the uniform optimality under any  $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ . This agrees with the intuition that under a game that is in favor of the casino  $(p > 0.5)$ , the gambler desire to bet the maximum to finish the game in as few rounds as possible. This Blackwell optimality is not unique, for example,  $\pi\left(\frac{15}{32}\right) = \frac{1}{32}$  is also optimal for any  $\gamma$ . Under  $\gamma = 1$  and when  $s$  can be written in finite many bits  $s = b_1 \dots b_{\ell(2)}$  in binary (assume  $b_\ell = 1$ ),  $\pi(s) = 2^{-l}$  is also an optimal policy. This policy is by repeatedly rounding the capital to carryover the bits, keeping the game within at most  $\ell$  rounds of bets.

Implications. Our results indicate hardness on reinforcement learning. The hardness on value function approximation: as the value function can fall on the set of fractal functions, it will not be possible to approximate the function with a piece-wise constant function (discretization) or a Lipschitz-continuous function (including a neural network) by an  $\epsilon$  accuracy with  $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon)$  complexity. The hardness on derivative: The value function's derivative cannot be estimated properly, as  $v(s)$  has a derivative of 0 almost everywhere, except on  $G_{\ell}$ , where it has a left derivative of infinity and a right derivative of 0. Algorithms relying on  $\frac{\partial v(s)}{\partial s}$  and  $\frac{\partial Q(s,a)}{\partial a}$  (Lillicrap et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2017) can suffer from the error estimation, where  $\bar{Q}(s,a)$  is the action-state-value function. In practice the boolean implementation of float numbers can further increase this error, as all points evaluated are on  $G_{\ell}$ . The hardness on Q-learning (Mnih et al., 2015; Watkins & Dayan, 1992; Baird, 1995): When  $\gamma = 1$ , the solution to the Bellman equation is not necessarily the value function. A large constant function can also be a solution, who may have a even small Bellman error than the optimal value function. This challenges Q-learning, whose goal is to find a solution of the Bellman equation and then treats the solution as the value function. Though the artificial  $\gamma$  is originally introduced to prevent the return from diverging, it can be necessary to prevent the algorithm from converging to a large constant in Q-learning.

# 2 DISCRETE CASE

The analysis of the discrete case of The Gambler's problem will give an exact solution. It will also explain the reason the plot on the book has a strange pattern of repeating spurious points.

The discrete case can be described by the following MDP: The state space is  $\{0, \dots, N\}$ ; the action space at  $n$  is  $\mathcal{A}(n) = \{0 < a \leq \min(n, N - n)\}$ ; the transition from state  $n$  and action  $a$  is  $n - a$  and  $n + a$  with probability  $p$  and  $1 - p$ , respectively; the reward function is  $r(N) = 1$  and  $r(n) = 0$  for  $0 \leq n \leq N - 1$ ; The MDP terminates at  $n \in \{0, N\}$ ; We use a time-discount factor of  $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ , where the agent receives  $\gamma^T r(N)$  rewards if the agents reach the state  $n = N$  at time  $T$ .

Let  $b(n), n \in \mathbb{N}, 0 \leq n \leq N$ , be the value function. The exact solution below of the discrete case is relying on Theorem 11, our main theorem which describes the exact solution of the continuous case. This theorem will be discussed and proved later in Section 4.1.

Proposition 1. Let  $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$  and  $p > 0.5$ . The optimal value function  $b(n)$  is  $v(n / N)$  in the discrete setting of the Gambler's problem, where  $v(\cdot)$  is the optimal value function under the continuous case defined in Theorem 11.

Proposition 1 indicates the discretization of the problems yields the discrete, exact evaluation of the continuous value function at  $0,1 / N,\ldots ,1$ . If we omit the learning error, the plots on the book and by the open source implementation (Zhang, 2019) are the evaluation of the fractal  $v(s)$  at  $0,1 / N,\ldots ,1$ . This explains the strange appearance of curve in the figure.

# 3 SETTING

We formulate the continuous Gambler's problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with  $S = [0,1]$  and  $\mathcal{A}(s) = (0,\min(s,1 - s)]$ ,  $s \in (0,1)$  to be the state space and the action space, respectively. Here  $s \in S$  represents the capital the gambler currently possesses and the action  $a \in \mathcal{A}(s)$  denotes the amount of bet. Without loss of generality we have assumed that the bet amount should be less or equal to  $1 - s$  to avoid the total capital to be more than 1. The consecutive state  $s'$  transits to  $s - a$  and  $s + a$  with probability  $p \geq 0.5$  and  $1 - p$  respectively. The process terminates if  $s \in \{0,1\}$  and the agent receives an episodic reward  $r = s$  at the terminal state. Let  $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$  be the discount factor and  $f(\cdot)$  be the value function.

From the Bellman equation of the above described MDP, the properties for  $f(\cdot)$  are

$$
f (s) = \max  _ {a \in \mathcal {A} (s)} p \gamma f (s - a) + (1 - p) \gamma f (s + a) \text {f o r a n y} s \in (0, 1), \tag {A}
$$

and

$$
f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1. \tag {B}
$$

It can be shown (in Lemma 2 and Lemma 3 later) that a function satisfying (AB) must be lower bounded by 0. A reasonable upper bound is 1, as the value function is the probability of the gambler eventually reaching the target, which must be between 0 and 1. It is also reasonable to assume the continuity of the value function at least at  $s = 0$ . Otherwise an arbitrary small amount of will have a fixed probability of reaching the target 1. The bounded version of the problem leads to the optimal value function:

$$
0 \leq \gamma \leq 1, p > 0. 5, f (s) \leq 1 \text {f o r a l l} s, f (s) \text {i s c i n t u o u s o n} s = 0. \tag {X}
$$

Respectively, the unbounded version of the problem leads to the solutions of the Bellman equation:

$$
0 \leq \gamma \leq 1, p > 0. 5. \tag {Y}
$$

The results hold for  $p = 0.5$  as well, except an extreme corner case of  $\gamma = 1$ ,  $p = 0.5$ , where the monotonicity in Lemma 3 will not apply. This case (Z) involves arguments over measurability and the assumption of Axiom of Choice, which we will discuss in the end of Section 4:

$$
\gamma = 1, p = 0. 5, f (s) \text {i s} \tag {Z}
$$

We are mostly interested in two settings: the first setting (ABX) and its solution Theorem 11, describes a set of necessary conditions of  $f(s)$  being the optimal value function of the gamblers problem. As we show later the solution of (ABX) is unique, this solution must be the value function. The second setting (ABY) and its solution Proposition 17 and Theorem 18, describes all the functions that satisfy the Bellman equation. These functions are the optimal points that value iteration and Q-learning algorithms may converge to. (ABY) is discussed in Theorem 23.

# 4 ANALYSIS

# 4.1 ANALYSIS OF THE GAMBLER'S PROBLEM

In this section we show that  $v(s)$  defined below is a unique solution of the system (ABX). Since the optimal state-value function must satisfy the system (ABX),  $v(s)$  is the optimal state-value function of the Gambler's problem. This statement is rigorously proved in Theorem 11.

Let  $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$  and  $p > 0.5$ . We define

$$
v (s) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\infty} (1 - p) \gamma^ {i} b _ {i} \prod_ {j = 1} ^ {i - 1} ((1 - p) + (2 p - 1) b _ {j}) \tag {1}
$$

for  $0 \leq s < 1$ , where  $s = 0.b_{1}b_{2}\ldots b_{l}\ldots$  is the binary representation of  $s$ . It is obvious that the series converges for any  $0 \leq s < 1$ .

The notation  $v(s)$  will always refer to the definition above in this paper and will not change with the context. We show later that this  $v(s)$  is the optimal value function of the problem. We use the notation  $f(s)$  to denote a general solution of a system, which varies according to the required properties.

Let the dyadic rationals

$$
G _ {\ell} = \left\{k 2 ^ {- \ell} \mid k \in \{1, \dots , 2 ^ {\ell} - 1 \} \right\} \tag {2}
$$

such that  $G_{\ell}$  is the set of numbers that can be represented by at most  $\ell$  binary bits. The general idea to verify the Bellman equation is to prove

$$
v (s) = \max  _ {a \in G _ {\ell} \cap \mathcal {A} (s)} (1 - p) \gamma v (s + a) + p \gamma v (s - a) \text {f o r a n y} s \in G _ {\ell}
$$

by induction of  $\ell = 1,2,\ldots$ , and generalize this optimality to the entire interval  $s\in (0,1)$ . Then we show the uniqueness of  $v(s)$  that solves the system (ABX). For presentation purposes, the uniqueness is discussed first, in Lemma 2, though it is depending on other lemmas.

As an overview, Lemma 2, 3, and 4 describe the system (ABX). Lemma 5, 7, and 8 describe the properties of  $v(s)$ . All the proofs are deferred to the appendix. Among them Lemma 2 carries the main idea leading to the theorem.

Lemma 2 (Uniqueness under existence). If  $v(s)$  and  $f(s)$  both satisfy (ABX), then  $v(s) = f(s)$  for all  $0 \leq s \leq 1$ .

Lemma 3 (Monotonicity). Let  $\gamma = 1$  and  $p > 0.5$ . If  $f(\cdot)$  satisfies (AB) then  $f(\cdot)$  is monotonically increasing on  $[0,1)$ .

Lemma 4 (Continuity). Let  $\gamma = 1$  and  $p \geq 0.5$ . If  $f(s)$  is monotonically increasing on  $(0,1]$  and it satisfies  $(AB)$ , then  $f(s)$  is continuous on  $(0,1]$ .

When  $f(s)$  is only required to be monotonically increasing on  $(0,1)$ , the continuity still holds but only on  $(0,1)$ .

Lemma 5. Let  $\ell \geq 1$ . For any  $s \in G_{\ell}$ ,

$$
\max  _ {a \in (G _ {\ell + 1} \backslash G _ {\ell}) \cap \mathcal {A} (s)} (1 - p) \gamma   v (s + a) + p \gamma   v (s - a) <   \max  _ {a \in G _ {\ell} \cap \mathcal {A} (s)} (1 - p) \gamma   v (s + a) + p \gamma   v (s - a).
$$

The arguments in the proof that either  $N_{b} + k \geq N_{c} + k' + 1$  or  $N_{c} + k' \geq N_{b} + k$  must hold is tight for integers  $N_{b}$  and  $N_{c}$ . This is the case for  $a \in G_{\ell+1} \setminus G_{\ell}$ . When  $a \notin G_{\ell+1}$ , this sufficient condition becomes even looser. This makes  $G_{\ell}$  to be the only set of possible optimal actions, given  $s \in G_{\ell}$ .

Corollary 6. Let  $\ell \geq 1$ . For any  $s \in G_{\ell}$ ,

$$
\operatorname * {a r g   m a x} _ {a \in \mathcal {A} (s)} (1 - p) \gamma   v (s + a) + p \gamma   v (s - a) \subseteq G _ {\ell}.
$$

Now we verify the Bellman property on  $\bigcup_{\ell \geq 1}G_{\ell}$

Lemma 7. Let  $\ell \geq 1$ . For any  $s \in G_{\ell + 1}$ ,

$$
\min  (s, 1 - s) \in \underset {a \in G _ {\ell + 1} \cap \mathcal {A} (s)} {\arg \max } (1 - p) \gamma v (s + a) + p \gamma v (s - a).
$$

Lemma 8. Both  $v(s)$  and  $v'(s) = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} (1 - p)\gamma v(s + a) + p\gamma v(s - a)$  are continuous at  $s$  if there does not exist an  $\ell$  such that  $s \in G_\ell$ .

The continuity of  $v(s)$  extends to the dyadic rationals  $\bigcup_{\ell \geq 1} G_{\ell}$  when  $\gamma = 1$ , which means that  $v(s)$  is continuous everywhere on  $[0,1]$  under  $\gamma = 1$ . It worth note that similar to the Cantor function,  $v(s)$  is not absolutely continuous. In fact,  $v(s)$  shares more common properties with the Cantor function, as they both have a derivative of zero almost everywhere, while having their value goes from 0 to 1, and their range is every value in between of 0 and 1.

The continuity of  $v'(s) = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)} (1 - p)\gamma v(s + a) + p\gamma v(s - a)$  indicates the optimal action to the uniquely  $\min(s, 1 - s)$  on  $s \notin G_\ell$ . This optimal action agrees with the optimal action we specified in Lemma 7, which makes  $\pi(s) = \min(s, 1 - s)$  an optimal policy for every state.

Corollary 9. If  $s \notin G_{\ell}$  for any  $\ell \geq 1$ ,

$$
\operatorname *{arg  max}_{a\in \mathcal{A}(s)}(1 - p)\gamma   v(s + a) + p\gamma   v(s - a) = \{\min (s,1 - s)\} .
$$

Lemma 10.  $v(s)$  is the unique solution of the system (ABX).

Theorem 11. Let  $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$  and  $p > 0.5$ . Under the continuous setting of the Gambler's problem, the optimal value function is  $v(1) = 1$  and  $v(s) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}(1 - p)\gamma^{i}b_{i}\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}((1 - p) + (2p - 1)b_{j})$  on  $0 \leq s < 1$ , where  $s = 0.b_{1}b_{2}\ldots b_{l}\ldots_{(2)}$  is the binary representation of the state  $s$ .

Proof. As the optimal state-value function must satisfy the system (ABX) and  $v(s)$  is the unique solution to the system,  $v(s)$  is the optimal value function.

Lemma 7 and Corollary 9 together induce one of the optimal deterministic policies as below. As the arguments hold uniformly for any  $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ , this optimality is also Blackwell optimal.

Corollary 12. The policy  $\pi(s) = \min(s, 1 - s)$  is Blackwell optimal, meaning it is optimal under any  $\gamma$ .

It is notably that when  $\gamma = 1$  and  $s \in G_{\ell} \setminus G_{\ell - 1}$  for some  $\ell$ , then  $\pi'(s) = 2^{-\ell}$  is also an optimal policy at  $s$ .

Lemma 7 and Theorem 11 also induce the following corollary that the optimal value function  $v(s)$  is fractal and self-similar.

Corollary 13. The curve of the value function  $v(s)$  on the interval  $[k2^{-\ell}, (k + 1)2^{-\ell}]$  is similar (in geometry) to the curve of  $v(s)$  itself on  $[0, 1]$ , for any integer  $\ell \geq 0$  and  $0 \leq k \leq 2^{\ell} - 1$ .

Some other notable facts about  $v(s)$  are as below:

Fact 14. The expectation

$$
\int_ {0} ^ {1} v (s) d s = (1 - p) \gamma = v (\frac {1}{2}).
$$

Fact 15. The derivative

$$
\lim  _ {\Delta s \rightarrow 0 ^ {+}} \frac {v (s + \Delta s)}{\Delta s} = 0, \quad \lim  _ {\Delta s \rightarrow 0 ^ {-}} \frac {v (s + \Delta s)}{\Delta s} = \left\{\begin{array}{l l}+ \infty ,&i f s = 0 o r s \in \bigcup_ {\ell \geq 1} G _ {\ell},\\0,&o t h e r w i s e.\end{array}\right. \tag {3}
$$

Fact 16.

$$
\operatorname *{arg  min}_{0\leq s\leq 1}v(s) - s = \{\frac{2}{3}\} .

# 4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE BELLMAN EQUATION

We have proved that  $v(s)$  is the optimal value function in Theorem 11, by showing the uniqueness of the solution of the system (ABX). However, the bounds (X) is derived from the context of the Gambler's problem by hand. It is rigorous enough to prove the optimal value function, but we are also interested in the solutions purely derived by the MDP setting. Also, algorithmic approaches such as Q-learning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992; Baird, 1995; Mnih et al., 2015) solves the MDP by finding the solution of the Bellman equation (AB), without eliciting the context of the problem. The solution will be treated as the optimal value function without further arguments. In this section, we

will inspect the system of Bellman equation (AB) of the Gambler's problem. We first discuss a more general case (ABY) where  $p > 0.5$ .

The value function  $v(s)$  is obviously still a solution of the system (ABY) without the  $f(s) \leq 1$  condition. The natural question is if there exist any other solutions. The answer is two-fold: When  $\gamma < 1$ ,  $f(s) = v(s)$  is unique. However, when  $\gamma = 1$ , the solution is either  $v(s)$  or a constant function at least 1. This indicates that algorithms like Q-learning have constant functions as their set of converging points. As  $v(s)$  itself is hard to approximate due to the non-smoothness, a constant function in fact induces a smaller approximation error and thus has a better optimality for Q-learning with function approximation.

It is immediate to generate this result to general MDPs, as function of a large constant solves MDPs with episodic rewards. This indicates that Q-learning may have more than one converging points and may diverge from the optimal value function under  $\gamma = 1$ . This leads to the need of  $\gamma$ , which is artificially introduced and biases the learning objective. More generally, the Bellman equation may have a continuum of finite solutions in an infinite state space, even with  $\gamma < 1$ . Some studies exist on the necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution of the Bellman equation to be the value function (Kamihigashi & Le Van, 2015; Latham, 2008; Harmon & Baird III, 1996). Though, the majority of this topic remains open.

The following proposition shows that when the discount factor is strictly less than 1, the solution toward the Bellman equation is uniquely the value function.

Proposition 17. When  $\gamma < 1$ ,  $v(s)$  is the unique solution of the system (ABY).

Proof. The uniqueness has been shown in Lemma 2 for the system (ABY). When  $\gamma < 1$  it corresponds to case (II), where the upper bound  $f(s) \leq 1$  in condition (X) is not used. Therefore Lemma 2 holds for (ABY) under  $\gamma < 1$ , so follows Lemma 10 the uniqueness as desired.

This uniqueness no longer holds under  $\gamma = 1$ .

Theorem 18. Let  $\gamma = 1$  and  $p > 0.5$ . A function  $f(s)$  satisfies (ABY) if and only if either

-  $f(s)$  is  $v(s)$  defined in Theorem 11, or  
-  $f(0) = 0$ ,  $f(1) = 1$ , and  $f(s) = C$  for all  $s \in (0,1)$ , for some constant  $C \geq 1$ .

The fact that a large constant function can also be a solution to the Bellman equation can be extended to wide range of MDP settings. The below proposition list one of the sufficient conditions but even without this condition it holds in practice most likely.

Proposition 19. For an arbitrary MDP with episodic rewards where every state has an action to transit to a non-terminal state almost surely,  $f(s) = C$  for all non-terminal states  $s$  is a solution of the Bellman equation system for any  $C$  greater or equal to the maximum one-step reward.

Proof. The statement is immediate by verifying the Bellman equation.

The rest of the section discusses the Gambler's problem under  $p = 0.5$ . In this case, the optimal value function is still  $v(s)$  by the same proof of Theorem 11. Proposition 17 also holds so  $v(s)$  is the only solution given  $\gamma < 1$ . When  $\gamma = 1$ , Theorem 11 still holds. Interestingly, when  $\gamma = 1$  and  $p = 0.5$ ,  $v(s) = s$ . This agrees with the intuition that the gambler does not lose its capital by placing bets in expectation, therefore the optimal value function should be linear to  $s$ . The problem that remains is the solution to the Bellman equation, under  $\gamma = 1$  and  $p = 0.5$ . This corresponds to the system (ABZ).

When  $p = 0.5$ , condition (A) indicates midpoint concavity

$$
f (s) \geq \frac {1}{2} f (s - a) + \frac {1}{2} f (s + a), \tag {4}
$$

where the equality must hold for some  $a \in \mathcal{A}(s)$ . As Lemma 3 no longer holds, a solution  $f(s)$  may have negative value for some  $s$ . Though if it does not have a negative value, it is not hard to show that the function must be linear. By condition (A) we need  $f(s) \geq s$  for any  $s$ . Therefore the solution is  $f(0) = 0$ ,  $f(1) = 1$ , and  $f(s) = C's + B'$  on  $0 < s < 1$  for some constants  $C' + B' \geq 1$ .

If  $f(s)$  does have a negative value on some  $s$ , then the midpoint concavity does not imply concavity. By recursively applying Equation 4 we see that the set  $\{(s, f(s)) \mid s \in [0,1]\}$  is dense and compact on  $[0,1] \times \mathbb{R}$ . The function becomes pathological, if it exists. Despite this, the following lemma shows that  $f(s)$  needs to be positive on the rationals  $\mathbb{Q}$ .

Lemma 20. Let  $f(s)$  satisfies (ABZ). If there exists  $0 \leq s^{-} < s^{+} \leq 1$  and a constant  $C$  such that  $f(s^{-}), f(s^{+}) \geq C$ , then  $f(s) \geq C$  for all  $s \in \{s^{-} + q(s^{+} - s^{-}) \mid q \in \mathbb{Q}, 0 \leq q \leq 1\}$ .

Lemma 20 agrees with the intuition that midpoint concavity indicates rational concavity. The below statements then give some insight on the irrational points.

Lemma 21. Let  $f(s)$  satisfies (ABZ). If there exists an  $\bar{s} \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$  such that  $f(\bar{s}) \geq 0$ , then  $f(s) \geq 0$  for all  $s \in \{q\bar{s} + r \mid q, r \in \mathbb{Q}, 0 \leq q, r, \leq 1, q + r \leq 1\}$ .

Corollary 22. Let  $f(s)$  satisfies (ABZ). If there exists an  $\bar{s} \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$  such that  $f(\bar{s}) < 0$ , then  $f(q\bar{s})$  is monotonically decreasing with respect to  $q$  for  $q \in \mathbb{Q}, 1 \leq q < 1 / \bar{s}$ .

Lemma 21 and Corollary 22 indicate that when there exists a negative or positive value, infinity many other points (that are not necessarily in its neighbor) must be negative or positive as well. It is sufficient to observe the complexity of the problem with these statements. In fact, it is shown that  $f(s)$  is not Lebesgue measurable and non-constructive (Sierpinski, 1920b), just by being midpoint concave but not concave.

Such an  $f(s)$  exists if and only if we assume Axiom of Choice (Sierpinski, 1920b;a). With the axiom we consider the field extension  $\mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Q}$  and specify a set of basis  $\mathbb{B} = \{b_i\}_{i\in \mathcal{I}}$ , known as the Hamel bases. With this basis  $\mathbb{B}$  every real number can be written uniquely as a combination of the elements in the  $\mathbb{B}\cup \{0\}$  with rational coefficients. Now denote every real number  $s$  as a unique vector  $(q,q_{i})_{i\in \mathcal{I}}$  such that  $s = q + \sum_{i\in \mathcal{I}}q_{i}b_{i}$ .

One of the solution can be shown by defining  $r(s) = q, s \in \mathbb{R}$ , where  $q$  is the rational component in the Hamel basis representation. As per there is only one rational number in the basis, the function  $r(s)$  is additive, namely,

$$
r (s _ {1}) + r (s _ {2}) = r (s _ {1} + s _ {2}).
$$

Let  $\beta(s), s \in \mathbb{R}$  be an arbitrary concave function. It is immediate to verify that

$$
f (s) = \beta (s - r (s)) + r (s) \tag {5}
$$

is a solution for the system (ABZ).

More generally,  $f(s)$  is any function in the form  $\beta(q, \{q_i\}_{i \neq i_0}) + z(q_{i_0})$ , where  $\beta(\cdot)$  is rational concave and  $z(\cdot)$  is linear and it satisfies the boundary conditions.

Theorem 23. Let  $\gamma = 1$  and  $p = 0.5$ . A function  $f(s)$  satisfies (ABZ) if and only if either

-  $f(s) = C' s + B'$  on  $s \in (0,1)$ , for some constants  $C' + B' \geq 1$ , or  
-  $f(s)$  is some non-constructive, non Lebesgue measurable function under Axiom of Choice.
