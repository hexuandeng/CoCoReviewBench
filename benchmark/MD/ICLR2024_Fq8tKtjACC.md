# ABSTRACT

We introduce phi-1, a new large language model for code, with significantly smaller size than competing models: phi-1 is a Transformer-based model with 1.3B parameters, trained for 4 days on 8 A100s, using a selection of "textbook quality" data from the web (6B tokens) and synthetically generated textbooks and exercises with GPT-3.5 (1B tokens). Despite this small scale, phi-1 attains pass@1 accuracy  $50.6\%$  on HumanEval and  $55.5\%$  on MBPP. It also displays surprising emergent properties compared to phi-1-base, our model before our finetuning stage on a coding exercises dataset, and phi-1-small, a model with 350M parameters trained with the same pipeline that still achieves  $45\%$  on HumanEval.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The art of training large artificial neural networks has made extraordinary progress in the last decade, especially after the discovery of the Transformer architecture Vaswani et al. (2017), yet the science behind this success remains limited. Amidst a vast and confusing array of results, a semblance of order emerged around the same time as Transformers were introduced, namely that performance improves somewhat predictably as one scales up either the amount of compute or the size of the network Hestness et al. (2017), a phenomenon which is now referred to as scaling laws Kaplan et al. (2020). The subsequent exploration of scale in deep learning was guided by these scaling laws Brown et al. (2020), and discoveries of variants of these laws led to rapid jump in performances Hoffmann et al. (2022). In this work, following the footsteps of Eldan and Li Eldan & Li (2023), we explore the improvement that can be obtained along a different axis: the quality of the data. It has long been known that higher quality data leads to better results, e.g., data cleaning is an important part of modern dataset creation Raffel et al. (2020), and it can yield other side benefits such as somewhat smaller datasets Longpre et al. (2023); Yu et al. (2023) or allowing for more passes on the data Muennighoff et al. (2023). The recent work of Eldan and Li on TinyStories (a high quality dataset synthetically generated to teach English to neural networks) showed that in fact the effect of high quality data extends well past this: improving data quality can dramatically change the shape of the scaling laws, potentially allowing to match the performance of large-scale models with much leaner training/models. In this work we go beyond the initial foray of Eldan and Li to show that high quality data can even improve the SOTA of large language models (LLMs), while dramatically reducing the dataset size and training compute. Importantly, smaller models requiring less training can significantly reduce the environmental cost of LLMs Bender et al. (2021).

We focus our attention on LLMs trained for code, and specifically writing simple Python functions from their docstrings as in Chen et al. (2021). The evaluation benchmark proposed in the latter work, HumanEval, has been widely adopted for comparing LLMs' performance on code. We demonstrate the power of high quality data in breaking existing scaling laws by training a 1.3B-parameter model, which we call phi-1, for roughly 8 passes over 7B tokens (slightly over 50B total tokens seen) followed by finetuning on less than 200M tokens. Roughly speaking we pretrain on "textbook quality" data, both synthetically generated (with GPT-3.5) and filtered from web sources, and we finetune on "textbook-exercise-like" data. Despite being several orders of magnitude smaller than competing models, both in terms of dataset and model size (see Table 1), we attain  $50.6\%$  pass@1 accuracy on HumanEval and  $55.5\%$  pass@1 accuracy on MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Programs), which are one of the best self-reported numbers using only one LLM generation. In Section 2, we give some details of our training process, and we discuss evidence for the importance of our data selection process in achieving this result. Moreover, despite being trained on much fewer tokens compared to existing models, phi-1 still displays emergent properties. In Section 3 we discuss these

Table 1: We use self-reported scores whenever available. Despite being trained at vastly smaller scale, phi-1 outperforms several competing models on HumanEval and MBPP.

emergent properties, and in particular we confirm the hypothesis that the number of parameters plays a key role in emergence (see e.g., Wei et al. (2022)), by comparing the outputs of phi-1 with those of phi-1-small, a model trained with the same pipeline but with only 350M parameters. The methodology used in this section is reminiscent of the Sparks of AGI paper Bubeck et al. (2023) for beyond-benchmark evaluation. Finally in Section 4 we discuss alternative benchmarks to evaluate the model and in Section 5 we study possible contamination of our training data with respect to HumanEval. We release the model for usage and evaluation by the broader community, but omit some details of the synthetic data generation, for proprietary reasons<sup>1</sup>.

More related works. Our work is part of the recent program of using LLMs for program synthesis, see Chen et al. (2021); Nijkamp et al. (2022) for more references on this. Our approach is also part of the emerging trend of using existing LLMs to synthesize data for the training of new generations of LLMs, Wang et al. (2022); Taori et al. (2023); Mukherjee et al. (2023); Lin et al. (2023); Jung et al. (2023). There is an ongoing debate about whether such "recursive training" might lead to narrower scope for the resulting LLM Shumailov et al. (2023); Gudibande et al. (2023), see Mukherjee et al. (2023) for a counterviewpoint. Note that in this paper we focus on a narrow task, similarly to Jung et al. (2023), where it is plausible to improve upon the teacher LLM (as is argued in the latter paper).

# 2 TRAINING DETAILS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HIGH-QUALITY DATA

As alluded to in the title of the paper, the central ingredient our model relies on textbook-quality training data. We devote this section primarily to our data curation ideas<sup>2</sup>.

Previous work used standard sources of text and code data for code generation, such as The Stack Kocetkov et al. (2022) and other web-based datasets (e.g., StackOverflow). While these form large and diverse corpus covering broad range of topics and use cases, we argue that these sources are not optimal for teaching the model how to reason and plan algorithmically. Based on manual inspection we observe that many of these snippets are not very instructive for learning the basics of coding:

- Many samples are not self-contained, meaning that they depend on other modules or files that are external to the snippet, making them hard to understand without additional context.  
- Typical examples do not involve any meaningful computation, but rather consist of trivial or boilerplate code, such as defining constants, parameters, or configuring GUI elements.  
- Samples that do contain algorithmic logic are often buried inside complex or poorly documented functions, making them difficult to follow or learn from.  
- The examples are skewed towards certain topics or use cases, resulting in an unbalanced distribution of coding concepts and skills across the dataset.

Figure 1: Pass@1 accuracy (\%) on HumanEval. The grouping of bar plots correspond to the usual scaling dimensions of either increasing the compute time (more passes on the data, here from 26B tokens seen to 76B) or increasing the number of parameters of the model (here from 350M to 1.3B). Each column within a group corresponds to different training datasets: (A) The first (orange) column represents the performance of models trained on the standard datasets of deduplicated Python files from The Stack and StackOverflow; (B) The second (light green) column represents the performance of models trained with our new dataset composition CodeTextbook; (C) Finally, the third (dark green) column corresponds to the respective second column models finetuned on our new CodeExercises dataset. For the 1.3B models, phi-1 and phi-1-base are checkpoints after training on 51B tokens and The Stack+ model was trained for 76B tokens. We highlight that even without any finetuning, our phi-1-base model trained on CodeTextbook dataset achieves  $29\%$  HumanEval performance with a mere 1.3B parameter model. The previous smallest model that achieves close to  $30\%$  performance on HumanEval was Replit-Finetuned at 2.7B parameters, which was trained with 100 times more training tokens than us Replit (2023). On top of this, finetuning on our CodeExercises dataset to obtain phi-1 not only gives us our top performance of  $51\%$  on HumanEval, but also unlocks unexpected coding capabilities (see Section 3).

One can only imagine how frustrating and inefficient it would be for a human learner to try to acquire coding skills from these datasets, as they would have to deal with a lot of noise, ambiguity, and incompleteness in the data. We hypothesize that these issues also affect the performance of language models, as they reduce the quality and quantity of the signal that maps natural language to code. We conjecture that language models would benefit from a training set that has the same qualities as a good "textbook": it should be clear, self-contained, instructive, and balanced.

In this work, we address this challenge directly and show that by intentionally selecting and generating high-quality data, we can achieve state-of-the-art results on code-generation tasks with a much smaller model and less compute than existing approaches. Our training relies on three main datasets:

- A filtered code-language dataset, which is a subset of The Stack and StackOverflow, obtained by using a language model-based classifier (consisting of about 6B tokens).  
- A synthetic textbook dataset of  $< 1$ B tokens of GPT-3.5 generated Python textbooks.  
- A small synthetic exercises dataset of  $\sim 180\mathrm{M}$  tokens of Python exercises and solutions.

We describe those datasets in more detail in the next subsections. Taken together, the above datasets contain less than 7B tokens. We refer to the combination of filtered code-language and synthetic textbook datasets as "CodeTextbook" and use it in the pretraining phase to obtain our base model phi-1-base—this model already achieves a competitive HumanEval performance of  $29\%$ . Then we use the 180M token synthetic exercises dataset, referred to as "CodeExercises", to finetune our phi-1-base model to obtain phi-1. Despite the small size of the "CodeExercises" dataset, finetuning with this dataset is crucial not only for large improvements in generating simple Python function as shown in Figure 1, but more broadly to unlock many interesting emergent capabilities in our phi-1 model that are not observed in phi-1-base (see Section 3).

# 2.1 FILTERING OF EXISTING CODE DATASETS USING A TRANSFORMER-BASED CLASSIFIER

We begin with publicly available Python code datasets: we use the Python subset of the deduplicated version of The Stack and the StackOverflow, which together contain over 35 million files/samples, totalling over 35B tokens. We annotate the quality of a small subset of these files (about 100k samples) using GPT-4: given a code snippet, the model is prompted to "determine its educational value for a student whose goal is to learn basic coding concepts".

We then use this annotated dataset to train a random forest classifier that predicts the quality of a file/sample using its output embedding from a pretrained codegen model as features. We note that unlike GPT-3.5, which we use extensively to generate synthetic content (discussed below), we use GPT-4 minimally only for annotations on the quality of a small subset of The Stack and StackOverflow samples. We thus view our usage of GPT-4 as merely a way to avoid tedious human-annotation efforts Dubois et al. (2023).

```

Our filtering boosts model performance significantly even without the synthetic datasets discussed below: for 350M parameter models trained on unfiltered Stack (deduplicated python) and Stack-Overflow, the HumanEval performance saturates at  $12.19\%$  even after training for 96k steps (200B tokens), while training on the filtered subset achieves  $17.68\%$  on HumanEval after 36k steps. We further improve this to  $20.12\%$  (reported in Figure 1) by training on a combination of the filtered dataset and the synthetic textbooks dataset discussed below.

# 2.2 CREATION OF SYNTHETIC TEXTBOOK-QUALITY DATASETS

One of the main challenges in creating a high-quality dataset for code generation is ensuring that the examples are diverse and non-repetitive. By diversity, we mean that the examples should cover a wide range of coding concepts, skills, and scenarios, and that they should vary in their level of difficulty, complexity, and style. Diversity is important for several reasons: it exposes the language model to different ways of expressing and solving problems in code, it reduces the risk of overfitting or memorizing specific patterns or solutions, and it increases the generalization and robustness of the model to unseen or novel tasks. However, achieving diversity is not trivial, especially when using synthetic data generated by another language model. Simply prompting the model to produce a coding textbook or a set of exercises, even with some variation in the instructions or the parameters, will likely result in a very homogeneous and redundant dataset, where the same concepts and solutions are repeated over and over with minor changes. This is because language models tend to follow the most probable or common paths given their training data and their priors, and they lack the creativity or the incentive to explore alternative or novel ways of generating code. Therefore, one needs to find the right "trick" that will induce the language model to be more creative and diverse in its output, while still maintaining the quality and the coherence of the examples. Inspired by Eldan & Li (2023), where a diverse set of short stories were created by including a random subset of words chosen from some fixed vocabulary in the prompt and requiring that they would be somehow combined in the generated text, we look for ways to inject randomness into the prompt in a way that gives rise to the generation of a diverse dataset.

# THE SYNTHETIC TEXTBOOK DATASET

This dataset consists of less than 1B tokens of GPT-3.5 generated Python textbooks, synthesized to provide a high-quality source of natural language heavy text interleaved with relevant code snippets. We further targeted the content of these textbooks to cover topics that promote reasoning and basic algorithmic skills. Here, diversity is obtained by providing constraints on topics and target audience of the generated textbook. The following is an example text from the synthetic textbook:

```python
To begin, let us define singular and nonsingular matrices. A matrix is said to be singular if its determinant is zero. On the other hand, a matrix is said to be nonsingular if its determinant is not zero. Now, let's explore these concepts through examples. Example 1: Consider the matrix  $\mathrm{A} = \mathrm{np.array}([1,2],[2,4])$ . We can check if this matrix is singular or nonsingular using the determinant function. We can define a Python function, `is_singular(A)`, which returns true if the determinant of A is zero, and false otherwise. import numpy as np def is_singular(A): det = np.linalg.det(A) if det == 0: return True else: return False A = np.array([[1,2],[2,4]]) print(is_singular(A)) # True
```

# THE CODEEXERCISES DATASET

This is a small synthetic exercises dataset consisting of less than 180M tokens of Python exercises and solutions. Each exercise is a docstring of a function that needs to be completed. The goal of this dataset is to align the model to perform function completion tasks based on natural language instructions. This dataset was also generated by GPT-3.5, where the main means of eliciting diversity is by constraining the function names. For this dataset in particular, we conduct explicit decontamination and alternative evaluations in the following sections to ensure that problems similar to those from HumanEval benchmark are not seen during finetuning. Example exercise:

```python
def validguessingletters(word: str, guesses: List[str]) -> List[str]:  
    '''  
Returns a list of valid guessing letters, which are letters that have not been guessed yet and are present in the word.  
Parameters:  
word (str): The word to guess.  
guesses (List[str]): A list of letters that have already been guessed.  
Returns:  
List[str]: A list of valid guessing letters.  
'''  
validletters = []  
for letter in word:  
    if letter not in guesses and letter not in validletters:  
        validletters.append(letter)  
return validletters
```

# 3 SPIKES OF MODEL CAPABILITY AFTER FINETUNING ON CODEEXERCISES

Figure 1 showed that the largest improvement in HumanEval resulted from finetuning on the small CodeExercises dataset (<200M tokens). CodeExercises consist exclusively of short Python tasks using only basic Python libraries. In this section, we demonstrate that, quite remarkably the model after finetuning also exhibits a substantial improvement in executing tasks that are not featured in the finetuning dataset. This includes managing intricate algorithmic tasks and using external libraries. This suggests that our finetuning process might have helped the model in reorganizing and consolidating the knowledge acquired during pretraining, even if such knowledge is not explicitly present in our CodeExercises dataset. In this section we will focus on qualitatively comparing and contrasting the capabilities of our finetuned model phi-1 and its pretrained base model phi-1-base.

# 3.1 FINETUNING IMPROVES THE MODEL'S UNDERSTANDING

Using a simple Python function that we created ourselves, we observe in Figure 2 that the model shows a much higher level of understanding and compliance with instructions after finetuning. In particular, phi-1-base struggles with the logical relationships in the prompts, while phi-1 can interpret the question and generate the answer correctly. In this example, even our 350M phi-1-small model shows some level of understanding of the problem even though the final solution is wrong.

# 3.2 FINETUNING IMPROVES THE MODEL'S ABILITY TO USE EXTERNAL LIBRARIES

We demonstrate here that finetuning on CodeExercises unexpectedly improves the model's ability to use external libraries such as Pygame, Tkinter, and pytorch, even though our exercises do not contain these libraries. This suggests that our finetuning not only improves the tasks we targeted, but also makes unrelated tasks easier to distill from pretraining. As an example, Figure 3 shows a PyGame example that asks the model to generate code to move a ball, where we see that phi-1 shows phenomenal improvement over phi-1-base model. See Appendix A for additional examples.

# 4 EVALUATION ON UNCONVENTIONAL PROBLEMS WITH LLM GRADING

A potential concern with the surprisingly good performance of phi-1 on HumanEval (see Table 1 and Figure 1) is that there might be memorization stemming from contamination of the synthetic CodeExercises dataset. We study this potential contamination directly in Section 5, while this section addresses the concern with a new evaluation that is designed to be unconventional enough to be unlikely to appear in our training data. To minimize bias and leakage, the new evaluation problems were created by a dedicated team that did not access the CodeExercises dataset or the final model. They created 50 new problems in the format as HumanEval with instructions to design problems that are unlikely to appear in real-world code bases or as coding exercises. Here is an example:

```python
def sort_concat_square_deduplicate(list1, list2, my_threshold):
    ''' This functions takes two lists of integers, sorts each of them in ascending order, concatenates them, squares the entries at even indices, filters out entries smaller than my_threshold and then removes duplicates. The resulting list is returned. '''
```

# Prompt:

```
""'' Write a PyGame. There is a ball. At every iteration, (1). The x-axis of the ball increases by a random integer between (-10, 10), (2). The y-axis of the ball increases by a random integer between (-20, 20). The x-axis of the ball should stay inside 0-400, and y-axis of the ball should stay inside 0-600. When the user press 'space', set the x-axis of the ball to 200 and y-axis of the ball to 400. ""

        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:

Figure 3: The above code snippets show the main loop of a simple PyGame program that bounces a ball on the screen. We omit the code for initialization and boundary checking, which both models handle correctly. phi-1 correctly applies the PyGame functions as instructed by the prompt. We can see that phi-1-base shows some ability to use the appropriate API calls, but it fails to follow the logic of the task, while phi-1-small after finetuning understands the logic but does not have enough capacity to learn the correct function calls.

One of the challenges of evaluating language models on coding tasks is that the output of the model is often binary: either the code passes all the unit tests or it fails. However, this does not capture the nuances of the model's performance, as it might have produced a code that is almost correct but has a minor error, or a code that is completely wrong but coincidentally passes some tests. Arguably, a more informative way of assessing the model's coding skills is to compare its output with the correct solution and grade it based on how well it matches the expected logic. This is similar to how humans are evaluated on coding interviews, where the interviewer does not only run the code but also examines the reasoning and the quality of the solution.

To evaluate candidate solutions, we therefore adopt the approach of using GPT-4 to grade the solution (such as in Eldan & Li (2023)). This approach has two distinct advantages: (1) by using GPT-4 as a grader, we can leverage its knowledge and generative abilities to obtain a more fine-grained and meaningful signal of the student model's coding capabilities, and (2) it obviates the need for tests<sup>3</sup>. Our prompt instructs the LLM to evaluate a student's solution first in a short verbal evaluation followed by grades from 0 to 10.

See Table 2 for our results with phi-1 and competing models. The grades on our new unconventional problems give the same ranking as HumanEval (see Table 1). phi-1 again achieves a score significantly higher than StarCoder, as it did on HumanEval. Given that the new problems have had no chance to contaminate the training data and, furthermore, were designed to be outside the training distribution, these results greatly increase our confidence in the validity of phi-1's performance.

# 5 DATA PRUNING FOR UNBIASED PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

In Figure 1, we see that training on CodeExercises leads to a substantial boost in the performance of the model on the HumanEval benchmark. To investigate this boost, we propose to prune the CodeExercises dataset by removing files that are "similar" to those in HumanEval. This process can be viewed as a "strong form" of data decontamination. We then retrain our model on such pruned data, and still observe strong performance on HumanEval. In particular, even after aggressively pruning more than  $40\%$  of the CodeExercises dataset (this even prunes files that are only vaguely similar to HumanEval, see Appendix C), the retrained phi-1 still outperforms StarCoder.

We believe that such data pruning experiment is a fair way to evaluate performance, and is more insightful than standard "contamination" studies in the literature that are usually based on measures of overlap between training and test data (e.g., Section 4.8 of Austin et al. (2021)). For sake of completeness we start this section by conducting a standard contamination experiment, which shows that CodeExercises is not contaminated by HumanEval in this standard sense.

# 5.1 N-GRAM OVERLAP

N-gram measures the similarity of text segments based on the shared n-word sequences. We calculate the n-gram overlap between the docstrings of each humaneval question and each exercise in the CodeExercises dataset that was generated. We found 4 humaneval questions with 13-gram overlap with at least one of the entries in our dataset. After further investigating, we found out that all the 4 overlap cases in the 13-gram are all false positives (see examples shown in Appendix C).

# 5.2 EMBEDDING AND SYNTAX-BASED SIMILARITY ANALYSIS

As we just saw, the n-grams are not refined enough to find similar code snippets between HumanEval and CodeExercises. Instead we use a combination of embedding and syntax-based distances. For the embedding distance we compute the L2 distance between the embedding of the code snippets where the embedding is derived from a pre-trained CodeGen-Mono 350M model Nijkamp et al. (2023b). We observe that the embedding distance is successful in capturing code pairs where the overall code semantics are similar, which can be inferred via the Python Docstring, function/class names, as well as the code structure. For the syntax-based distance we calculate the (string) edit distance between the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of two given code snippets. The AST distance successfully identifies overlapping sections between code pairs while being agnostic to non-syntax text such as variable/function naming, comments, and Python Docstrings. See Appendix C for examples of code pairs that are captured at various  $\tau$  and embedding distances.

For our pruning experiments on CodeExercises, we fix a threshold for the embedding distance, and we test several match rate  $\tau$  for the AST distance. We vary  $\tau$  between 0.95 and 0.8, which corresponds to  $4\%$  to  $40\%$  of problems in CodeExercises, respectively. Table 3 summarizes the performance of our retrained phi-1 on pruned datasets (with  $\tau = 0.95, 0.9, 0.85$  and 0.8) versus the original phi-1 trained on full CodeExercises and the  $15.5B$ -parameter StarCoder-prompted. We divide the HumanEval problems into two subsets ("similar" and "non-similar") based on whether or not they have at least one close match (for this given  $\tau$ ) inside the original CodeExercises dataset. We then report the accuracy of the models on each subset of HumanEval separately. As one can see, even after heavily pruning our dataset, phi-1 still outperforms StarCoder-Prompted by a large margin, which validates that our performance boost is not due to dataset "contamination", even when the latter term is understood loosely.

Table 3: Percentage of similar versus non-similar HumanEval problems correctly solved by different models. Similarity is determined based on whether or not the corresponding HumanEval problem has any close matches inside the CodeExercises dataset (for a given  $\tau$ ). The problem count denotes the number of HumanEval problems within each subset. Here,  $\tau$  is the threshold on AST-based match rate between codes for similarity check.

# 6 CONCLUSION

Just as a comprehensive, well-crafted textbook can provide a student with the necessary knowledge to master a new subject, our work demonstrates the remarkable impact of high-quality data in honing a language model's proficiency in code-generation tasks. By crafting "textbook quality" data we were able to train a model that surpasses almost all open-source models on coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and MBPP despite being 10x smaller in model size and 100x smaller in dataset size. We hypothesize that such high quality data dramatically improves the learning efficiency of language models for code as they provide clear, self-contained, instructive, and balanced examples.

There remains a number of limitations of our model compared to larger models for code. Firstly, phi-1 is specialized in Python coding, which restricts its versatility compared to multi-language models. Secondly, phi-1 lacks the domain-specific knowledge of larger models such as programming with specific APIs or using less common packages. Lastly, due to the structured nature of the datasets and the lack of diversity in terms of language and style, phi-1 is less robust to stylistic variations or errors in the prompt (for instance, its performance substantially degrades with grammatical mistakes in the prompt). We expand on these limitations and other failure modes of phi-1 in Appendix B.

None of these limitations seem fundamental, and with more work our approach could be used to tackle each one of them, although it is unclear what scaling might be necessary to overcome them (both for the model size and the dataset size). We also believe that significant gains could be achieved by using GPT-4 to generate the synthetic data instead of GPT-3.5, as we noticed that GPT-3.5 data has a high error rate. It is interesting that phi-1 is able to achieve such high coding proficiency despite those errors (a similar phenomenon was observed in Allen-Zhu & Li (2023) where a language model can be trained on data with  $100\%$  error rate and still generate correct answers at test time).

More generally, our work provides evidence that developing good methodology for creating high-quality datasets is a central direction of research for advancing natural language processing and related fields (see also Jung et al. (2023) for further evidence). However, creating high-quality datasets is not a trivial task, and it poses several challenges that need to be addressed. One challenge is to ensure that the dataset covers all the relevant content and concepts that one wants the model to learn, and that it does so in a balanced and representative way. Another challenge is to ensure that the dataset is truly diverse and non-repetitive, so that the model does not simply overfit to the data or memorize specific patterns or solutions. This requires finding ways to inject randomness and creativity into the data generation process, while still maintaining the quality and the coherence of the examples. Moreover, even after creating such datasets, we lack a good methodology to measure and evaluate the amount of diversity and redundancy in the data. For example, if we have a dataset with coding exercises, it is hard to determine how many different variations of each exercise exist, and how they are distributed across the dataset. Finally, as language models themselves will be used to curate data for future language models, it further increases the urgency on the ethical and social implications of training such models, such as the accountability, the transparency, and the bias of the data and the models that are involved in this process.
