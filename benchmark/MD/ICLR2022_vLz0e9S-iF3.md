# ABSTRACT

We develop a quantitative theory on the escape problem of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and investigate the effect of the sharpness of loss surfaces on escape. Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in various domains, however, it has opened up theoretical problems. For instance, it is still an ongoing question as to why an SGD can find solutions that generalize well over non-convex loss surfaces. An approach to explain this phenomenon is the escape problem, which investigates how efficiently the SGD escapes from local minima. In this paper, we develop a novel theoretical framework for the escape problem using "quasi-potential," the notion defined in a fundamental theory of stochastic dynamical systems. We show that quasi-potential theory can handle the geometric property of loss surfaces and a covariance structure of gradient noise in a unified manner through an eigenvalue argument, while previous research studied them separately. Our theoretical results imply that sharpness contributes to slowing down escape, but the SGDs noise structure cancels the effect, which ends up exponentially accelerating its escape. We also conduct experiments to empirically validate our theory using neural networks trained with real data.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the successes of deep learning have been a major driving force of machine learning development (LeCun, 2019). Owing to its strong generalization capability, deep learning has diverged into a wide range of domains, such as computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), speech recognition (Mikolov et al., 2011), and natural language processing (Collobert et al., 2011). This high performance of deep learning is underpinned by gradient-based learning algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variations (Kingma & Ba, 2014; Schmidt et al., 2021). However, at the same time, those unprecedented successes raise a question:

"Why does SGD learn parameters of neural networks with high generalization performance?"

Although non-convex optimization problems in neural networks have been thought to be difficult to solve (Blum & Rivest, 1992), SGD is known for finding nearly optimal solutions, and further, the obtained solutions generalize well Keskar et al. (2016); Brutzkus et al. (2017). Analyzing the role of SGD on the performance of deep learning is an area of research that is currently attracting strong interest (Masters & Luschi, 2018; Jastrzebski et al., 2021).

One of the promising directions to answer this question is to study the geometric properties of a training loss landscape. An increasing number of empirical studies have found that the minima obtained by SGD have distinctive geometric properties. Keskar et al. (2016) have shown that the shape of the minima obtained by SGD tends to be flat. He et al. (2019b) have deepened the investigation by picturing that SGD settles on the flatter side of asymmetric loss surface, which they named "asymmetric valley." Draxler et al. (2018) and Garipov et al. (2018) have shown that separate minima obtained by independent training processes are internally connected through pathways. Li et al. (2017) have proposed a dimension reduction technique to visualize the geometry of the loss surface, visually confirming flat minima. Most significantly, Jiang et al. (2019)'s large-scale experiment verified that minima in flat and wide regions have the strongest correlations with generalization capabilities. To

Figure 1: Visual illustration of steepness (Definition 3). The steepness of  $\varphi$ ,  $S_{0T}(\varphi)$ , is greater than  $S_{0T}(\psi)$  because  $\varphi$  climbs up to a higher point of loss surface.

attain a theoretical understanding of SGD, it is key to quantitatively analyze the connection between SGD and the geometric properties of the loss surface.

An escape problem is a scheme of analyzing the dynamic of SGD escaping from local minima of loss surfaces (Zhu et al., 2019; Jastrzebski et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2020). This scheme allows us to investigate why SGD avoids (potentially) bad local minima and settles on good minima. Zhu et al. (2019) first investigated the SGD's escape phenomenon and showed that SGD's escape is enhanced by its unique noise structure, called the "anisotropic noise structure." Invoked by their analysis, many studies have been attempting to theoretically quantify this phenomenon. Hu et al. (2019) rigorously identified the role of learning rate in escaping. Nguyen et al. (2019) used the Levy process to provide the precise description of SGD as well as its escaping phenomena. Jastrzebski et al. (2017) developed a theory of stochastic differential equation and quantified how the anisotropic noise affects its fast escape from sharp minima. Xie et al. (2020) refined the mathematical aspect and showed that the SGD's noise structure exponentially enhances escaping under a setup of diffusion theory.

In this paper, we apply the quasi-potential theory to the escape problem, and investigate a mean exit time, which formally quantifies escaping. The notion of quasi-potential is defined in a fundamental theory of stochastic dynamical systems, named a large deviation theory (Freidlin & Wentzell, 2012; Dembo & Zeitouni, 2010), and it is used to quantify a distribution of trajectories that a stochastic dynamical system takes. To illustrate quasi-potential for our problem setup, we introduce an intuitive notion, steepness of a trajectory (Fig. 1 and Definition 3), and show that it is an effective tool to analyze the escape of SGD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies the quasi-potential to formalize the relationship between SGD's escape and the geometric properties of loss surface.

Our main findings and contributions are as follows:

- We develop the novel quasi-potential theory that rigorously describes the escape of SGD by a batch-size, a learning rate, and geometric parameters of loss surfaces. In particular, our theory can analyze gradient noise of SGD and sharpness of loss surfaces in a unified manner. For this, we use eigenvalues of Hessian matrices of the loss surfaces.  
- We incorporate several practical settings that were not always covered in the previous theories: an effect of discrete update of SGD, state-dependent noise on gradients in SGD, and no assumption of the stationary distribution.  
- We obtain a theoretical finding that a loss surface with sharp minima, i.e. with its Hessian matrices having large eigenvalues, is an obstacle to the escape of SGD. This is obtained by the unified analysis of gradient noise and loss surfaces by our theory, and has not been found in the existing studies.

Further,  ${H}^{\prime }$  is a Hesse matrix on one of the neighboring points of the minimum and  ${\lambda }^{\prime }$  is one of its eigenvalues of  ${H}^{\prime }$  .  ${\Delta L}$  is a difference of training loss values within a neighborhood of minimum,  $\alpha  \in  \left( {0,2}\right\rbrack$  is an index of heavy-tailedness of gradient noise in SGD,and  $\delta  \in  \left( {0,1}\right)$  and  $s \in  \left( {0,1}\right)$  are values that implicitly include various factors of the escaping problem. "Non-stationary" denotes whether the result holds without assuming that SGD reaches a stationary distribution before escaping. "Parameter dependent noise" denotes whether noise in SGD depends on current parameters. "Discrete setup" means whether the analysis is valid with a discrete update by SGD. Our theory has two main advantages: (i) it explicitly quantifies various elements of SGD and loss surfaces without relying on auxiliary variables to incorporate them,such as  $s$  and  $\delta$  ,and (ii) it is applicable to a wide range of the settings.

# 1.1 COMPARISON WITH EXISTING STUDIES ON ESCAPE PROBLEM

In Table 1, we compare the exit time derived with the results of the other studies that analyze the escape problem. There are two main points of focus. The first is the time to escape that we derive. Our theory realizes a unified analysis of exit time incorporating all the related parameters, batch size, learning rate, radius of the region around a minimum, and sharpness of a minimum. As a consequence, we show that the eigenvalues of the Hesse matrix increase the time to escape, which has not been found in the other studies. The second is the flexibility of the setting. Different from Jastrzebski et al. (2017) and Xie et al. (2020), our theory does not require that SGD reaches the stationary distribution before escaping, which is known to take exponentially many time steps (Xu et al., 2017; Raginsky et al., 2017). Additionally, our theory can evaluate the correspondence with the practical SGD, which has a discrete update rule and state-dependent noise.

# 2 SETTING AND PROBLEM

# 2.1 STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEM

Consider a learning model parameterized by  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$ . Given training examples  $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$  and a loss function  $\ell(\theta, x_i)$ , we consider a training loss  $L(\theta) := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \ell(\theta, x_i)$  and a mini-batch loss

$L^{B}(\theta) \coloneqq \frac{1}{B}\sum_{x_{i} \in \mathcal{B}}\ell(\theta, x_{i})$ , where  $\mathcal{B}$  is a randomly sampled subset of the training data such that  $|\mathcal{B}| = B$ . We assume that  $L(\theta)$  is differentiable and its derivative  $\nabla L(\theta)$  is Lipschitz continuous.

We mainly consider two types of SGD: a discrete SGD and a continuous SGD. Although a discrete SGD is used in practice, we study continuous SGD as a starting point of our analysis because of its mathematical convenience. This is a widely used approach in general SGD analyses (Ali et al., 2019; Advani et al., 2020) as well as in the escaping analyses (Jastrzebski et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2020).

Discrete SGD: First, we give the usual discrete formulation of SGD. Given an initial parameter  $\theta_0\in \mathbb{R}^d$ , SGD generates a sequence of parameters  $\{\theta_k\}_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$  by the following update rule:

$$
\theta_ {k + 1} = \theta_ {k} - \eta \nabla L ^ {B} \left(\theta_ {k}\right), \tag {1}
$$

for  $k\in \mathbb{N}$ , where  $\eta >0$  is a learning rate.

In particular, we focus on SGD whose noise on gradients has a Gaussian distribution. We decompose  $-\nabla L^{B}(\theta_{k})$  in (1) into a gradient term  $-\nabla L(\theta_{k})$  and a noise term  $\nabla L(\theta_k) - \nabla L^B (\theta_k)$ , and consider a case that the noise is Gaussian. With this setting, the update rule in (1) is rewritten as

$$
\theta_ {k + 1} = \theta_ {k} - \eta \nabla L \left(\theta_ {k}\right) + \sqrt {\frac {\eta}{B}} W _ {k}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $W_{k} \sim N(0, \eta C(\theta_{k}))$  is a parameter-dependent Gaussian noise with its covariance  $C(\theta) \coloneqq \mathbb{E}_{i \sim \mathrm{Uni}(\{1, \dots, N\})} \left[ (\nabla L(\theta) - \nabla \ell(\theta, x_{i}))^{\top} (\nabla L(\theta) - \nabla \ell(\theta, x_{i})) \right]$ . We assume that  $C(\theta)$  is Lipschitz continuous.

The Gaussianity of the noise on gradients is justified by the following reasons: (i) if the batch size  $B$  is sufficiently large, the central limit theorem ensures the noise term becomes Gaussian noise, and (ii) several empirical studies show that the noise term becomes Gaussian noise (Mandt et al., 2016; Jastrzebski et al., 2017; He et al., 2019a), although different findings have been obtained in other settings (Simsekli et al., 2019).

Continuous SGD: We also give a continuous SGD, which is exactly discretized to (2) by a classic Euler scheme (Definition 5.1.1 of Gobet (2016)). With a time index  $t \geq 0$  and the given initial parameter  $\theta_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , the continuous dynamic of SGD is written as follows:

$$
\dot {\theta} _ {t} = - \nabla L \left(\theta_ {t}\right) + \sqrt {\frac {\eta}{B}} C \left(\theta_ {t}\right) ^ {1 / 2} w _ {t} \tag {3}
$$

where  $w_{t}$  is a  $d$ -dimensional Wiener process, i.e. an  $\mathbb{R}^d$ -valued stochastic process with  $t$  such that  $w_{0} = 0$  and  $w_{t + u} - w_{t} \sim N(0, uI)$  for any  $t, u > 0$ . We note this system can be seen as a Gaussian perturbed dynamical system with a noise magnitude  $\sqrt{\frac{\eta}{B}}$  because  $\eta$  and  $B$  do not evolve by time.

# 2.2 ESCAPE PROBLEM AND MEAN EXIT TIME

We consider the problem on how SGD escapes from minima of loss surfaces. In this paper, our target of interest is quantified by a notion of mean exit time for continuous SGD and discrete mean exit time of discrete SGD. Let  $\theta^{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$  be a local minimum of loss surfaces, and  $D \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$  be a  $r$ -neighborhood of  $\theta^{*}$  with  $r > 0$ . We define the mean exit time as follows:

Definition 1 (Mean exit time from  $D$ ). Consider a continuous SGD starting from  $\theta_0 \in D$ . Then, a mean exit time of the continuous SGD (3) from  $D$  is defined as

$$
\mathbb {E} [ \tau ] := \mathbb {E} \left[ \min  \left\{t: \theta_ {t} \notin D \right\} \right].
$$

Definition 2 (Discrete mean exit time from  $D$ ). Consider a discrete SGD starting from  $\theta_0 \in D$ . Then, a discrete mean exit time of the discrete SGD (2) from  $D$  is defined as

$$
\mathbb {E} [ \nu ] := \mathbb {E} \left[ \min  \left\{k \eta : \theta_ {k} \notin D \right\} \right].
$$

These definitions are common in quasi-potential theory (Freidlin & Wentzell, 2012; Gobet, 2016). Intuitively, the smaller  $\mathbb{E}[\tau]$  or  $\mathbb{E}[\nu]$  becomes, the faster the system escapes from a region  $D$ . In other words, the system has a stronger tendency to escape from  $\theta^{*}$ .

We remark that there are other formulations to analyze the escape problem. Zhu et al. (2019) define escaping efficiency as  $\mathbb{E}_{\theta_t}[L(\theta_t) - L(\theta_0)]$ . Jastrzebski et al. (2017) and Xie et al. (2020) study a ratio between the probability of coming out from  $\theta^{*}$ 's neighborhood and the probability mass around  $\theta^{*}$ .

# 2.3 BASIC ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE ESCAPE PROBLEM

We provide basic assumptions for the escape problem, commonly used in the literature (Mandt et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2019; Jastrzewski et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2020).

Assumption 1 ( $L(\theta)$  is locally quadratic). There exists a matrix  $H^{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  such that for any  $\theta \in D$ , the following equality holds:

$$
\forall \theta \in D, L (\theta) = L (\theta^ {*}) + \nabla L (\theta^ {*}) (\theta - \theta^ {*}) + \frac {1}{2} (\theta - \theta^ {*}) ^ {\top} H ^ {*} (\theta - \theta^ {*})
$$

Assumption 2 (Hesse covariance matrix). For any  $\theta \in D$ ,  $C(\theta)$  is approximately equal to  $H^{*}$ .

Although Assumption 2 has been commonly used, its validity is still being discussed (Section 2 in Xie et al. (2020) and Appendix A in Jastrzebski et al. (2017)). Thus, as further investigation, we consider a setup under the following relaxed assumption.

Assumption 3 (Relaxation of Assumption 2). There exist constants  $0 < c_{1} \leq c_{2} < \infty$  such that for  $\theta \in D$ ,  $C(\theta) = H^{*}G$  holds with a symmetric matrix  $G$  as  $0 < c_{1} \leq \lambda_{\min}(G) \leq \lambda_{\max}(G) \leq c_{2}$ .

Assumption 3 allows a Hesse matrix in a neighborhood of minima to be a wide range of positive definite matrices.

# 3 QUASI-POTENTIAL THEORY

We introduce the basic notions of the quasi-potential theory. We start with defining a notion of steepness of a trajectory followed by the systems (3) on a loss surface  $L(\theta)$ . Let  $\varphi = \{\varphi_t\}_{t\in [0,T]}$  be a trajectory over a finite time interval  $[0,T]$ . Or more formally,  $\varphi$  is a continuous map from  $[0,T]$  to  $\mathbb{R}^d$ , and is an element of  $\mathbf{C}_{0T}(\mathbb{R}^d)$  which is a support of a dynamical process in  $[0,T]$ . Given a trajectory  $\varphi$  and the system (3), we define the following quantity:

Definition 3 (Steepness). Steepness of a trajectory  $\varphi$  followed by (3) is defined as

$$
S _ {0 T} (\varphi) := \frac {1}{2} \int_ {0} ^ {T} \left(\dot {\varphi} _ {t} + \nabla L \left(\varphi_ {t}\right)\right) ^ {\top} C \left(\varphi_ {t}\right) ^ {- 1 / 2} \left(\dot {\varphi} _ {t} + \nabla L \left(\varphi_ {t}\right)\right) d t.
$$

Steepness  $S_{0T}(\varphi)$  can be intuitively interpreted as the hardness of climbing that the system (3) is exposed to while following the trajectory  $\varphi$  on  $L(\theta)$  (Fig. 1). This notion is generally utilized in the field of dynamical systems, for example, and is called "normalized action functional" in Section 3.2 of Freidlin & Wentzell (2012) and "rate function" in Section 1.2 of Dembo & Zeitouni (2010).

Steepness is useful to describe a distribution of trajectories generated by dynamical systems. If a trajectory  $\varphi$  has a large steepness  $S_{0T}(\varphi)$ , the probability that the dynamic system takes the trajectory decreases exponentially. Formally, the distribution is analyzed as follows.

Lemma 1 (Theorem 3.1 in Section 3.3 Freidlin & Wentzell (2012)). For any  $\delta, \zeta > 0, \varphi \in \mathbf{C}_{0T}\left(\mathbb{R}^d\right)$ , and sufficiently small  $\varepsilon > 0$ , the following holds:

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {\varphi^ {\prime}} \left(\varphi^ {\prime} \in \mathbf {C} _ {0 T} (\mathbb {R} ^ {d}) \mid \rho \left(\varphi^ {\prime}, \varphi\right) <   \delta\right) \geq \exp \left\{- \varepsilon^ {- 2} \left[ S _ {0 T} \left(\varphi\right) + \zeta \right] \right\},
$$

where  $\rho (\varphi^{\prime},\varphi) = \sup_{t\in [0,T]}\| \varphi_{t}^{\prime} - \varphi_{t}\|$

Lemma 2 (Theorem 3.1 in Section 3.3 Freidlin & Wentzell (2012)). Let  $\Phi(s) = \{\varphi \in \mathbf{C}_{0T}(\mathbb{R}^d) \mid S_{0T}(\varphi) \leq s\}$ . For all  $\delta, \zeta, s > 0$ , and sufficiently small  $\varepsilon > 0$ , the following holds:

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {\varphi^ {\prime}} \Big \{\varphi^ {\prime} \in \mathbf {C} _ {0 T} (\mathbb {R} ^ {d}) \mid \rho (\varphi^ {\prime}, \Phi (s)) \geq \delta \Big \} \leq \exp \{- \varepsilon^ {- 2} (s - \zeta) \},
$$

where  $\rho (\varphi^{\prime},\Phi (s)) = \inf_{\varphi \in \Phi (s)}\rho (\varphi^{\prime},\varphi)$

Although we restrict our attention to the system (3), the same discussion is applicable to a general class of diffusion processes and dynamical systems with Markov perturbations (For details, see section 5.7 in Dembo & Zeitouni (2010) or Section 6.5 in Freidlin & Wentzell (2012)).

Although there are several trajectories from  $\theta^{*}$  to  $\theta \in D$  with different steepness, a dominating factor for mean exit time is the smallest steepness among them, which is called quasi-potential:

Definition 4 (Quasi-potential). Quasi-potential of  $\theta \in D$  is defined as

$$
V(\theta):= \inf_{T > 0}\inf_{\varphi :(\varphi_{0},\varphi_{T}) = (\theta^{*},\theta)}S_{0T}(\varphi).
$$

Similar to steepness, quasi-potential can be seen as the minimum effort the system (3) needs to climb from  $\theta^{*}$  up to  $\theta$  on  $L(\theta)$ . (For more details, see Section 5.3 of Freidlin & Wentzell (2012)).

# 4 MEAN EXIT TIME ANALYSIS FOR SGD

# 4.1 ASSUMPTIONS

To analyze the mean exit time, the quasi-potential theory requires several assumptions regarding the stability of the system (3) at  $\theta^{*}$ .

Assumption 4 ( $\theta^{*}$  is asymptotically stable). For any neighborhood  $U$  that contains  $\theta^{*}$ , there exists a small neighborhood  $V$  of  $\theta^{*}$  such that gradient flow with any initial value  $\theta_0 \in V$  does not leave  $U$  for  $t \geq 0$  and  $\lim_{t \to \infty} \theta_t = \theta^*$ .

Assumption 5 ( $D$  is attracted to  $\theta^{*}$ ).  $\forall \theta_0 \in D$ , gradient flow with initial value  $\theta_0$  converges to  $\theta^{*}$  without leaving  $D$  as  $t \to \infty$ .

where "gradient flow" means a continuous gradient descent defined as  $\dot{\theta}_t = -\nabla L(\theta_t)$ .

Stability is a commonly used notion in dynamical systems (Hu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017), although it does not always appear in SGD's escaping analysis (Zhu et al., 2019; Jastrzebski et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2020). Assumption 4 is known to be equivalent to the local minimality of  $\theta^{*}$  under the condition that  $L(\theta)$  is real analytic around  $\theta^{*}$  (Absil & Kurdyka, 2006). Also, by definition of asymptotic stability in Assumption 4, we can always find a region  $D$  that satisfies Assumption 5. The more detailed properties of stability can be found, such as in Section 6.5 of Teschl (2000). Assumption 4 and 5 are necessary to obtain the result (5) in the following section.

Also, we require the following assumption as a boundary condition of Theorem 4.

Assumption 6.  $L(\theta^{*}) = 0$

Assumption 6 is only for simplifying our proofs without changing the essence of our problem.

# 4.2 MAIN RESULTS

We analyze the mean escape time of SGD under the above assumptions. In preparation, we state two facts. First,  $V(\theta)$  is calculated as a solution of the following equation:

$$
\frac {1}{2} \nabla V (\theta) ^ {\top} C (\theta) ^ {1 / 2} \nabla V (\theta) - \nabla L (\theta) ^ {\top} \nabla V (\theta) = 0. \tag {4}
$$

Second, if  $\frac{B}{\eta}$  is sufficiently small, the mean exit time can be expressed using  $V(\theta)$  as

$$
\mathbb {E} [ \tau ] = \exp \left[ \frac {B}{\eta} V _ {0} \right], \tag {5}
$$

where  $V_0 \coloneqq \min_{\theta' \in \partial D} V(\theta')$ . Although these facts have been investigated in the literature (for example, see Hu et al. (2019) and Section 4.4 in Freidlin & Wentzell (2012)), we give our own theorems and proofs in Appendix A and B for completeness.

The followings are our main results. We start with the mean exit time of Continuous SGD. Let  $\mathbb{E}[\tau_{\mathrm{SGD}}]$  be the mean exit time of the continuous SGD, and let  $\mathbb{E}[\tau_{\mathrm{isoSGD}}]$  be the mean exit time of an isotropic continuous SGD whose  $C(\theta)$  is set to  $I$ .

Theorem 1 (Continuous SGD). Suppose that Assumption 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 hold. Then, for sufficiently small  $\frac{\eta}{B}$ ,

$$
\mathbb {E} [ \tau_ {\mathrm {i s o S G D}} ] = \exp \left[ 2 \frac {B}{\eta} r ^ {2} \lambda \right], \quad \mathbb {E} [ \tau_ {\mathrm {S G D}} ] = \exp \left[ 2 \frac {B}{\eta} r ^ {2} \lambda^ {\frac {1}{2}} \right].
$$

This result gives an exact expression for the expected escape time with the explicit values of SGD. The results also have two implications. First, these result both of those results show that the mean escape time exponentially increases in the smallest eigen value of  $H^{*}$ , i.e.  $\lambda$ . This implies that sharper minima generally slow down the escaping, which is seemingly opposite to the implication of the existing literature (Jastrzebski et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2020). But in fact this is consistent with the existing literature because some of the sharpness factor is implicitly included in other variables such as  $\Delta L$ . Second, our result endorses the fact that SGD's anisotropic noise exponentially accelerates the escaping (Xie et al., 2020), because the result shows that the mean exit time of SGD is smaller than that of isotropic SGD by exp  $[\lambda^{\frac{1}{2}}]$ .

We also develop additional result under the weaker assumption (Assumption 3).

Theorem 2 (Continuous SGD under weaker assumption). Suppose that Assumption 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hold. Then, for sufficiently small  $\frac{\eta}{B}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} \mathbb {E} [ \tau_ {\mathrm {i s o S G D}} ] & = \exp \left[ 2 \frac {B}{\eta} r ^ {2} \lambda \right] \\ \exp \left[ 2 \frac {B}{\eta} r ^ {2} \frac {1}{\sqrt {c _ {2}}} \lambda^ {\frac {1}{2}} \right] \leq \mathbb {E} [ \tau_ {\mathrm {S G D}} ] & \leq \exp \left[ 2 \frac {B}{\eta} r ^ {2} \frac {1}{\sqrt {c _ {1}}} \lambda^ {\frac {1}{2}} \right] \end{array}
$$

It claims that replacing Assumption 2 by Assumption 3 has no effect in the isotropic case, but has a constant effect in the anisotropic case.

Our theory can be extended to the discrete case. By  $\mathbb{E}[\nu_{\mathrm{SGD}}]$ , we denote the discrete mean exit time of the discrete SGD, and by  $\mathbb{E}[\nu_{\mathrm{isoSGD}}]$  we denote the one of an isotropic version of the discrete SGD, i.e. with  $C(\theta)$  being  $I$ . The escaping problem of a discrete SGD, the discrete mean exit time, is formulated as a special case of Gobet & Menozzi (2010). By substituting  $g(\cdot) = 0$ ,  $f(\cdot) = 1$  and  $k(\cdot) = 0$  in Theorem 17 in Gobet & Menozzi (2010), we can obtain the following simplified statement.

$$
\max  \left\{\mathbb {E} \left[ \nu_ {\mathrm {i s o S G D}} \right] - \mathbb {E} \left[ \tau_ {\mathrm {i s o S G D}} \right], \mathbb {E} \left[ \nu_ {\mathrm {S G D}} \right] - \mathbb {E} \left[ \tau_ {\mathrm {S G D}} \right] \right\} = \mathcal {O} (\sqrt {\eta}).
$$

which immediately prove the following theorem:

Theorem 3 (Discrete SGD). Given, Assumption 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, for sufficiently small  $\frac{\eta}{B}$ ,

$$
\mathbb {E} [ \nu_ {\mathrm {i s o S G D}} ] = \exp \left[ 2 \frac {B}{\eta} r ^ {2} \lambda \right] + \mathcal {O} (\sqrt {\eta}), \quad \mathbb {E} [ \nu_ {\mathrm {S G D}} ] = \exp \left[ 2 \frac {B}{\eta} r ^ {2} \lambda^ {\frac {1}{2}} \right] + \mathcal {O} (\sqrt {\eta})

This result suggests that the discrete error does not majorly affect the escape. We note this is the first study that confirms the validity of using a continuous SGD model (3) for escape analysis.

We describe the proof for Theorem 2. We omit the proof of Theorem 1 because it is a special case of Theorem 2 ( $c_{1} = c_{2} = 1$ ).

# 4.3 PROOF OUTLINE

We describe a proof of Theorem 2. We begin with the isotropic case and then investigate the nonisotropic case. The following lemmas are useful, whose proofs are in Appendix C.

Lemma 3. Let  $A, B$  be  $n \times n$  symmetric matrices whose eigen values are non-negatives. Then,

$$
\lambda_ {i} (A B) \leq \lambda_ {i} (A) \lambda_ {j - i + 1} (B) \quad \forall i \leq j
$$

Lemma 4. For positive definite symmetric matrices  $A$  and  $B$ , the following inequality holds

$$
\lambda_ {\min } (A B) \geq \lambda_ {\min } (A) \lambda_ {\min } (B)
$$

Isotropic case,  $\operatorname{E}[\tau_{\mathrm{isoSGD}}]$ : We substitute  $I$  to  $C(\theta)$ . By the Jacobi equation (4) which is formally given by Theorem 4 in Appendix A, we have the following form for  $\theta \in D$ :

$$
\frac {1}{2} \nabla V (\theta) ^ {\top} \nabla V (\theta) - \nabla L (\theta) ^ {\top} \nabla V (\theta) = 0. \tag {6}
$$

We have  $\nabla V(\theta) = 2\nabla L(\theta)$  as a solution of (6). Given that  $V(\theta^{*}) = 0$  by the definition of steepness and  $L(\theta^{*}) = 0$  by Assumption 6, we obtain  $V(\theta) = 2L(\theta)$  for  $\theta \in D$ . Therefore, we have

$$
V _ {0} = \min _ {x \in \partial D} 2 L (\theta) = \min _ {x \in \partial D} 2 \theta^ {\top} H ^ {*} \theta = 2 r ^ {2} \lambda .
$$

The second equality follows Assumption 1 and 6. Combined with the fact (5), which is formally shown in Theorem 5 in Appendix B, we obtain the statement of Theorem 2 in the anisotropic case.

Anisotropic case,  $\operatorname{E}[\tau_{\mathrm{SGD}}]$ : Similar to the isotropic case, the equation (4) (or Theorem 4) gives

$$
\frac {1}{2} \nabla V (\theta) ^ {\top} C (\theta) ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \nabla V (\theta) - \nabla L (\theta) ^ {\top} \nabla V (\theta) = 0.
$$

$\nabla V(\theta) = 2C(\theta)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\nabla L(\theta)$  is a solution of (6). Then,  $\nabla V(\theta)$  is simply written as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \nabla V (\theta) = 2 C (\theta) ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \nabla L (\theta) = 2 C (\theta) ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \nabla \left(\theta^ {\top} H ^ {*} \theta\right) = 2 C (\theta) ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} 2 H ^ {*} \theta \\ = 2 \left(H ^ {*} G\right) ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} 2 H ^ {*} = 4 G ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} H ^ {* - \frac {1}{2}} H ^ {*} \theta = 4 G ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} H ^ {* \frac {1}{2}} \theta . \\ \end{array}
$$

The second equation follows Assumption 1 and 6, and the fourth equation follows Assumption 3. Given that  $V(\theta^{*}) = 0$ , we obtain  $V(\theta) = \theta^{\top} G^{-\frac{1}{2}} H^{*\frac{1}{2}} \theta$  for  $\theta \in D$ . Then, we rewrite  $V_{0}$  is as

$$
V _ {0} = 2 r ^ {2} \lambda_ {\min } \left(G ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} H ^ {*} ^ {\frac {1}{2}}\right), \tag {7}
$$

By Lemma 3, we develop an upper bound of  $\lambda_{\min}(G^{-1/2}H^{*1/2})$  as  $\lambda_{\min}(G^{-1/2}H^{*1/2}) = \lambda_{\min}(H^{*1/2}G^{-1/2}) \leq \lambda_{\min}(H^{*1/2})\lambda_{\max}(G^{-1/2}) \leq c_1^{-1/2}\lambda^{1/2}$ . Similarly, Lemma 4 gives us the following lower bound  $\lambda_{\min}(G^{-1/2}H^{*1/2}) \geq \lambda_{\min}(G^{-1/2})\lambda_{\min}(H^{*1/2}) \geq c_2^{-1/2}\lambda^{1/2}$ . We substitute the two inequalities into the solution (7), then obtain the following form of  $V_0$ :

$$
2 r ^ {2} \frac {1}{\sqrt {c _ {2}}} \lambda^ {\frac {1}{2}} \leq V _ {0} \leq 2 r ^ {2} \frac {1}{\sqrt {c _ {1}}} \lambda^ {\frac {1}{2}}
$$

Combined with (5), or Theorem 5 in Appendix B, we finish the proof of Theorem 2.

We conduct an experiment to validate our result of discrete setup (Theorem 3), using a neural network and real-world datasets. We use a multi-layer perception and the AVILA dataset (De Stefano et al., 2011) to observe that the discrete mean exit time of SGD has exponential dependence on eigenvalue  $\lambda$ , radius  $r$  and a ratio of the learning rate and the batch size  $\eta / B$ .

In order for our essential assumptions to hold, we use the mean square loss with  $\ell_2$  regularizer for  $L(\theta)$  (Assumption 1) and train the model with the gradient descent for a sufficiently long time to obtain  $\theta_0$  near  $\theta^*$ . We set the  $r$ -neighborhood of  $\theta_0$  as  $D$  (Assumption 4 and 5). To measure the discrete mean exit time, we repeatedly execute a vanilla SGD from  $\theta_0$  for 1000 times and take an average number of steps at which SGD exit from  $D$  (i.e. when the distance from  $\theta_0$  becomes farther than  $r$ ).

To control  $\lambda$ , we follow the approach of Xie et al. (2020). We obtain sharper minima by mapping the loss function  $L$  to  $L_{\alpha}$  such that  $L_{\alpha}(\theta) \coloneqq L(\sqrt{\alpha}\theta)$  ( $\alpha > 0$ ) and setting  $\theta_0 \coloneqq \theta_0 / \alpha$ . Since this mapping coverts  $\lambda$  to  $\alpha\lambda$  with other properties remaining the same, we use  $\alpha$  as a surrogate of  $\lambda$ .

We show the results in Figure 2. As Theorem 3 suggests, the noise magnitude  $\sqrt{\eta / B}$  exponentially accelerates the escaping under our experiment setup, and eigen value and radius have the effect

of exponentially slowing down the escaping The experiment can be reproduced by using the code below. $^{1}$

# 6 RELATED WORKS

We summarize relevant studies related to the topics on loss surfaces and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We mainly consider the following three factors.

Loss surface shape: Shape of loss surfaces have long been a topic of interest. The argument that the flatness of loss surfaces around local minima improves generalization was first studied by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1995; 1997), and the observation has recently reconfirmed in deep neural networks by Keskar et al. (2016). Sagun et al. (2017) empirically examined the flatness of loss surfaces. The theoretical advantage of the flatness was criticized by Dinh et al. (2017) in terms of scale-sensitivity of flatness, but Tsuzuki et al. (2020) and Rangamani et al. (2019) tackled the criticism by developing scale invariant flatness measures. An effect of the shape of loss surfaces on SGD was investigated in Wu et al. (2017); Ge et al. (2018), and Chaudhari et al. (2019); Foret et al. (2020) developed a variant of SGD which made use of this fact. In addition to the flatness, He et al. (2019b) proposed a new notion of asymmetry of loss surfaces, and Draxler et al. (2018); Garipov et al. (2018) studied how several local minima in a loss surface are connected. Li et al. (2018) developed a random dimensional reduction method to visualize loss surfaces on high dimensional spaces.

Exit/Stability of SGD: How SGD behaves in neighborhoods of local minima in loss surfaces is investigated from two aspects: stability and escape efficiency. For stability, a way in which SGD finds local minima and stabilizes was analyzed by Wu et al. (2018); Kleinberg et al. (2018); Achille et al. (2019); Li et al. (2017). Smith & Le (2017) used Bayesian ideas to analyze the stability. For exiting aspects, Jastrzebski et al. (2017) investigated an effect of a Hesse matrix of local minima on the ease of escaping ineffective local minima, and Xie et al. (2020) elaborated this effect via quantitative analysis. Zhu et al. (2019) showed that anisotropic structure of gradient noise by SGD is useful in escaping inefficient local minima, and Nguyen et al. (2019) studied an effect of non-Gaussianity of the gradient noise.

SGD property: Detailed nature of SGD itself is also an object of interest. The magnitude of the gradient noise by SGD is an important factor, including its relation to a learning rate and a batch size. An effect of large batch sizes on the reduction of gradient noise is investigated in Hoffer et al. (2017); Smith et al. (2018); Masters & Luschi (2018). Another area of interest is shape of a gradient noise distribution. Zhu et al. (2019); Hu et al. (2017); Daneshmand et al. (2018) investigated the anisotropic nature of gradient noise and its advantage. Simsekli et al. (2019) discussed the fact that a gradient noise distribution has a heavier tail than Gaussian distributions. Nguyen et al. (2019); Simsekli et al. (2019) showed benefits of these heavy tails for SGD. Panigrahi et al. (2019) rigorously examined gradient noise in deep learning and how close it is to a Gaussian. Xie et al. (2020) studied a situation where the distribution is Gaussian, and then analyzes the behavior of SGD in a theoretical way.

# 7 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we develop a novel quasi-potential theory for the escape problem of SGD. Our theory gives an intuitive picture of SGD's escaping dynamic, and also but is an effective tool for formal analysis. In our main result, our theory explicitly describes how the escape of SGD is affected by a batch-size, a learning rate, and radius of regions, and sharpness (Theorem 1). Furthermore, due to its flexibility, our theory allows the extended analyses, such as SGD's escape under even weaker assumption on covariance matrix (Theorem 2) and the escape problem of a discrete SGD (Theorem 3). We believe our theory provides a solid insight for SGD dynamics and also flexible theory for further studies.
