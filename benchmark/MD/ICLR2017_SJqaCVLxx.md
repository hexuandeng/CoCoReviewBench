# ABSTRACT

Nowadays, advances in electronic circuits have created a fresh interest in a model for machine learning, named artificial neural networks. Neural networks have rendered facts at supernatural faster than ever before. That's why implementation of models in pattern and voice recognition based on the operation of mammals' brain has become an interest of scientific society. On the basis of preceding idea the  $\mathrm{CNN}^1$  networks are inspired by the vision system of mammal's brain in pattern recognition. Thus, the CNNs will be expanded to build advanced artificial brain and robots. Although, almost all of the presented articles are based on the error backpropagation algorithm and calculation of derivations of error, our innovative proposal refers to engaging  $\mathrm{TICA}^2$  filters and  $\mathrm{NSGA - II}^3$  genetic algorithms to train the LeCun-5 CNN network. Consequently, genetic algorithm updates the weights of LeCun-5 CNN network similar to chromosome update. Thus, in our approach the weights of LeCun-5 are obtained in two stages. The first is pre-training and the second is fine-tuning. As a result, our approach impacts in learning task by relying on the NSGA-II genetic algorithm and the TICA filters to earn the weights of the LeCun-5.

# 1 Background

The CNN network presented by Fukushima (Fukushima, 1975; Fukushima, 1980; Fukushima, 1986; Fukushima, 1989; Imagawa, 1993) in 1975 to solve handwritten digit recognition problems, called it Neocognitron. Originally the CNN inspired by the works of Hubel and Wiesel (Wiese, 1962) on the neurons of the cat's visual cortex. The input layer resembles a 2D image which is received from the retina and the remaining next layers simulate the simple cells and complex cells.

The LeCun in (Y. LeCun, 1990) has implemented the first CNN, trained by online Backpropagation, with an extreme accurate recognition process (high accuracy percentage). First, by applying convolution operation over the input layer with a tiny window, called kernel, several maps in convolutional layer are created. The receptive field and the Kernel window contain an identical  $5 \times 5$  size in LeCun-5 for pertinent overlapping. In the convolutional layer, each kernel window has 25 trainable weights.

In fact, the bold traits of these networks contain a consistency of automatic extracting features and the ability of learning invariant features e.g. rotations, edge orientations and scales. Subsequently, combining the outputs of maps in the subsample layer caused to produce the later complex feature map called pooling operation. However, when the subsample layer ignored, it must combine the maps of convolutional layer to produce complex feature map.

The traits of scheme in design pattern recognition regime in AI must be simple, effective and brief. That's why, in the closing layer, a classifier is employed to discriminate input samples; in other type of CNN, the hybrid at the ending layer could be supplanted with one of the SVM, MLP or HMM classifiers. In addition, the weights-sharing is applied to obviate the superabundance computation in all of the CNN models. An internal hierarchy consistency in CNNs learns the input pattern features on training phase automatically.

Additionally, LeCun has presented high performance architectures of CNNs for handwritten digit and character recognition e.g. LeCun-1, LeCun-4, LeCun-5, etc. The variant of CNNs include different architectures and training methods, as ConvNets (Y. LeCun, 2010) consistency of employments in vision to recognize the input pattern; successively, variety of purposes ensued from CNNs e.g. object, voice, fingerprint, signature, etc.

Basically, the ConvNets contains several stages to extract pertinent features of vision for classifier layers placed at the later; furthermore, the ConvNets encompasses three core parts, input data, code and decode. In addition, each of these three parts called "stage" and each stage includes filter bank layer, non-Linear layer, and feature pooling layer.

The various training methods exist in CNNs and the training of a CNN can be supervised or unsupervised (Or semi-supervised) (M. Ranzato, 2006; Y. LeCun, 1998; K. Kavukcuoglu, 2009; H. Lee, 2009; Yann Lecun, 1999; Koray Kavukcuoglu, 2010; Y-Lan Boureau, 2010; LeCun, 2010). One of them has combined an unsupervised training algorithm based on self-organization and reinforcement learning rule. However, later studies have shown that the performance of the Neocognitron trained by exploiting a supervised algorithm obtain result in more accurate outcome. Training has performed layer by layer, starting from the first layer while the appropriate results obtained and it would fix other layers' weights, such as the training of a particular layer which would only start after the training of the previous layer has completed. Another technique called reinforcement learning employed the supervised algorithm in order to train each of the feature maps in a layer which obtains specific visual feature as a horizontal edge. By contrast, other works (e.g. online Backpropagation (Y. LeCun, 1990),  $\mathrm{RBM}^1$  (H. Lee, 2009),  $\mathrm{LM}^2$  (Kelley, 1999)) exploited different solutions by applying different neuron's activation function to obtain the best accuracy, specified corresponding connections within layers of neurons through a number of maps and layers.

Nowadays, abundant researchers incline to develop CNN. Recently, a study administered the kernel idea in SVM classifier and implemented a recent CNN called  $\mathrm{CKN}^1$  by author (Julien Mairal, 2014). In addition, one of the works applied semi-supervised method in two stages, 1. Pretraining: unsupervised training with a few unlabeled natural image samples and minimizing the object function (or energy function or sparse coding); in fact, using patches of the natural images cause to train the filters in the first and the third layers and resemble to the vision feature as Gabor filters. 2. Fine-tuning: supervised training as Softmax regression (Jiquan Ngiam, 2010) with a tiny labeled samples.

CNNs applications dissolve the issues .e.g. traffic signs (LeCun, 2011), Indoor Semantic Segmentation (Camille Couprie, Clement Farabe, Laurent Najman, Yann LeCun, 2014), Scene labeling (Clement Farabet, 2013), hand command for robots (Jawad Nagi, 2011), visual documents (Patrice Y. Simard, 2003), Vision (Y. LeCun, 2010; Xiang Zhang, 2014), etc. In the future CNNs could be expanded to build artificial brain and advanced robots.

Unfortunately, due to complicated computations scientists have not practiced upon optimizing the structure or weights of CNN. Besides, the lack of how learning large dataset in heuristic and genetic algorithm in CNN as 60000 samples in MINST dataset in the training and test phases were obstructed to engage the whole samples in the study.

Briefly, in the paper, using the TICA filters and NSGA-II algorithms caused to be capable of training a type of CNNs called LeCun-5 by NSGA-II algorithm in two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning on the tiny pack of handwritten digits $^2$  (a distinct pack encompasses 50 samples from MINST dataset).

# 1.1 The LeCun-5 Model

In the preceding section, the scheme of LeCun-5 was enlightened in the second paragraph. The CNN topic tragically has not been organized for academic teaching. Therefore, comprehending all aspects of CNN's mechanism topic isn't a concrete issue for new enthusiastic researcher; intense rehearsing to be required to clarify the respective issues. Comprehending coherently, figure 1 illustrates the principal architecture of LeCun-5 model which had been trained with LeCun's Online BP<sup>3</sup> Algorithm; the LeCun-5 plot depicts spatially that how it retains the input image circumstance vision form on output of beginning layers.

Furthermore, State-of-the-art CNN, demonstrate a high performance in fast pattern recognition systems. In fact, the CNN with respective scheme extract the features in hierarchy and induce a spectrum of input pattern upon output of the layers. Consequently, the closing spectrum shrinks to categorize input facts. The learning method of the CNN concentrates upon extracting pertinent trait of the pattern automatically. The CNN exploits convolution operation on two-dimensional input pattern by moving a tiny window containing neural network weights of each map in convolution layer (kernel). The kernel of each map presumes identical weight in convolution operation for respective map called weights sharing as obviating the plethora of computation. The data are received from the tiny inner window called receptive field that convolved with kernel. The outer data of the tiny window are set to zero for two arguments: Firstly to simplifying computations and next, extracting local vision features, so-called localization. Thoroughly, the LeCun-5 consists of seven stratums exclude the input layer (Duffner, 2007). The size of input assigns to a dimension of  $32 \times 32$  pixels. The first five layers, C1, S2, C3, S4, and C5 determine convolution and sub-sampling layers successively as a continuum regime.

Figure 1: The architecture of LeNet-5

The receptive filed refers to a dimension of  $5 \times 5$  window for convolution layers and a subsampling ratio factor of 2. In figure 2 shows the distinct of plot in two preliminary layers associated with the input domain called retina. In general, at the end of each convolution layer the subsample layer is attached.

Figure 2: The convolution map and subsample of LeNet-5 (Duffner, 2007).

Vital issue is necessary to pose how the maps of convolution and subsampling layers must be computed. Hence, the feature maps connected to retina in convolution layer computes by Eq 1 as follows:

$$
y _ {j} ^ {(1)} (x, y) = \varphi^ {(1)} \left(\sum_ {(u, v) \in k} w _ {j 0} ^ {(1)} (u, v) y ^ {(0)} (x + u, y + v) + b _ {j} ^ {(1)}\right) \tag {1}
$$

Where  $j$  denotes value of index map,  $\mathsf{w}_{\mathrm{j0}}^{(1)}(\mathsf{u},\mathsf{v})$  denotes value of constituting a dimensions  $5\times 5$  trainable kernel convolve to  $\mathbf{y}^{(0)}$  denotes the receptive fields of input map facts,  $\varphi^{(1)}$  denotes activation function,  $\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{j}}^{(1)}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$  denotes the feature map  $j$ ,  $\mathsf{b}_{\mathrm{j}}^{(1)}$  denotes value of bias in map  $j$ , and the  $k$  denotes the bound of kernel as definition  $k = \{(u,v)\in \mathbb{N}^2 |0\leq u < 5$  and  $0\leq v < 5\}$  and causes to restrict to dimensions of  $24\times 24$  kernel.

And each of the map in subsample layers constructed by a reduction of the preceding respective layer map. Subsequently, with assigning to ratio factor of 2 in the LeCun-5 scheme, the map in

subsample is bounded to dimension of  $12 \times 12$ . Eq 2 computes the subsample map. The activation function can be in discrete form and affiliated to allocating Backpropagation algorithm.

$$
y _ {j} ^ {(2)} (x, y) = \varphi^ {(2)} \left(w _ {\mathrm {j}} ^ {(2)} \times \sum_ {(\mathrm {u}, \mathrm {v}) \in \{0, 1 \} ^ {2}} y _ {j} ^ {(1)} (2 x + \mathrm {u}, 2 \mathrm {y} + \mathrm {v}) + b _ {j} ^ {(2)}\right) \tag {2}
$$

Where  $w_{j}^{(2)}$  denotes the weights of subsample map  $j$ ,  $y_{j}^{(1)}$  denotes the feature map in respective preceding layer,  $y_{j}^{(2)}(x,y)$  denotes the feature map  $j$  in current subsample layer,  $b_{j}^{(2)}$  denotes the bias of map  $j$  in current subsample layer and  $\varphi^{(2)}$  denotes the activation function in current subsample layer.

Each map in the layer C3 includes several kernels convolve on several respective maps in preceding layer. The kernel dimensions in the layer C3 set to  $3 \times 3$  dimensions. All of the convolution computations accumulate the kernels of respective maps relating upon the maps in preceding layer and the respective maps bias in  $l$  layer. In fact the pooling operation completed. Eq 3 denotes computing the maps in the layer C3.

$$
y _ {j} ^ {(l)} (x, y) = \varphi^ {(l)} \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {i} \in \mathrm {I}} \sum_ {(\mathrm {u}, \mathrm {v}) \in \mathrm {k}} w _ {j i} ^ {(l)} (u, v) y _ {i} ^ {(l - 1)} (x + u, \mathrm {y} + v) + b _ {j} ^ {(l)}\right) \tag {3}
$$

Where I denotes the set of preceding maps affiliated to convolution maps  $l$ ,  $j$  in C3 layer denotes layer index,  $w_{ji}^{(3)}$  denotes the kernels of feature map  $j$  in C3 layer,  $y_{i}^{(l-1)}$  denotes preceding maps  $i$ ,  $b_{j}^{(l)}$  denotes bias for map  $j$  in C3 layer,  $\varphi^{(l)}$  denotes activation functions in respective map  $j$  in C3 layer (in LeCun-5 employment tangent hyperbolic), and  $k$  denotes the bound of kernel as definition  $k = \{(u,v) \in \mathbb{N}^2 | 0 \leq u < s_x \text{ and } 0 \leq x < s_y\}$ .

Furthermore, with paramount neurons induce complex computation in the Lecun-5 scheme. With weigh sharing idea obviates the extreme connections LeCun-5 as multi-layer perceptron<sup>1</sup> of ordinary neural network. The connections between the input layer and C1 contain full connections. The connections in C3 and S2 allocate to a table described in figure 3. The convolution maps in C5 consist only dimensions  $1 \times 1$  that apply fully connected to each sub-sampling map in preceding layer S4, thus it needs to be leaded to an excessive number of trainable parameters in this layer (i.e. 48,120).

Layer F6 engages an additional hidden neuron layer fully connected to layer C5 and exploited 84 neurons. The model uses  $\mathrm{RBF}^2$  neural network for classifying the input sample consists of one complete connection with F6 layer. To compute the outputs of a RBF unit  $\mathbf{y}_i^{(6)}$ , apply Eq 4:

$$
y _ {i} ^ {(6)} = \sum_ {j} \left(x _ {j} - w _ {j i} ^ {(6)}\right) ^ {2} \tag {4}
$$

Finally, each RBF unit computes the squared Euclidean distance between its dimensions 84 input vector  $x_{j}$  and its weight vector  $w_{ji}^{(6)}$ .

# 1.2 TICA Filters

Topography independent component analysis conveys a 2D map component that has been organized with adjacent components to extract similar features. On the other hand, it refers to the ability of generalization usage. The component extracts visual features that earn from tiny patches of learning natural images. Therefore, the employment model induces the regime to minimize the correlations of energies with a pertinent object function applied.

The model can be a CNN (K. Kavukcuoglu, 2009) or can be an optimization algorithm (Koray, 2008). Figure 4 shows the TICA filters with the size of  $16 \times 16$  that after 5000 iterations obtains them. The TICA issue affiliates to the receptive field in mammal visual cortex. In fact, they resemble to the Gaussian 2D filters. Consequently, the invariant features e.g. orientations, tiny degree of rotations and scales are capable to be extracted by TICA.

Figure 4: The TICA Filters with dimensions  $16 \times 16$

The core idea presented by Jutten and Herault in 1991 (Aapo Hyvarinen, 2001) tried to reduce the noise of surrounding sounds from several microphones to get the voice of narrator without distortion. At the beginning, their study led to ICA<sup>1</sup> with appearing of a statistical model where the observed data expressed as a linear transformation of latent variables exist non-Gaussian and mutually independent. The presented model Eq 5 determines as follows:

$$
x = A s \tag {5}
$$

Where  $\mathbf{x} = (\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n)^{\mathrm{T}}$  denotes the vector of observed random variables,  $s = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n)^{\mathrm{T}}$  denotes the vector of the independent latent variables (the "independent components"), and A conveys an unknown constant matrix, called the mixing matrix.

When we do ICA on image data, it simply means trying to find an expansion of the form (figure 5).

Figure 5: ICA on image data.

In fact, ICA similar to PCA works over origin data to find the principle components of data in order to reduce the dimensional fact. ICA can recover the origin image from the mixed images robustly. On the contrary, ICA doesn't need to have any information to construct data; PCA needs to have the averages of data to reconstruct the data. Learning and calculating can be induced by sparse coding (K. Kavukcuoglu, 2009).

# 1.3 NSGA-II Algorithm

Srinivas and Deb presented NSGA method in 1993 (Deb, 1995). The NSGA algorithm implements for MOP target purposes with a high performance. The regenerated version, NSGA-II presented in 2002 (Amrit Pratap, 2002) which stores all of the information of dominated particles and the number of domination for each particle. Constantly, for pertinent performance, the mentioned techniques help to acquire Pareto-Optimal<sup>1</sup> points with reduced complex computing by exerting non-dominated individuals and calculating of crowding point's distance individuals. Figure 6 illustrates the NSGA-II algorithm.

![](images/4c2bfd2311f2d4e297e83012f07f736fea19923b6595e9392095fa6fa40a4be3.jpg)  
Figure 6: Flow chart of NSGA-II algorithm

Totally, the sorting functional NSGA-II algorithm has been improved by storing the frequency of each dominated individual with the others. The NSGA-II has three crucial issues: quick sorting for non-dominated individuals; computation of crowded distance in entire Pareto-Front; method of individual selection. In fact they have rendered the sharing fitness function.

Literally, for quick sorting, the entire individuals must be compared with themselves and pulled the non-dominated out of them with assigning the rank 1. The task is repeated until the entire population allocates a rank from 1 to  $\mathbf{N}$  to sort the individuals. Figure 7 illustrates the Pareto-Front issue in three parts. The part (a) shows the situation C member with the two lines' perpendicular paralleled with axes on C, as the adjacent of the specified individual C has posed over the district of top left, bottom left, top right and bottom right. The bottom left members dominated by C, If would be assumed the objective functions f1 and f2 maximized, the top right area dominated C member. The district of bottom right and top right have been ignored to determine for dominating.

The Pareto-Front refers to compute additional measure inside of population ranking called crowded distance. Therefore, the distance of chromosomes is computed and stored with respective adjacent in Pareto-Front by using Euclidean distance for entire members. Totally, the population rank and the crowded distance prepare the fitness value for entire members whilst the member with the low rank could be assigned to the low fitness value.

The method of individual selection conveys the computation of ranking of non-dominated and crowded distance of individuals. Thus, two values acquired for ranking and computing crowded distance for comparing two members of population. The algorithm selects the member with lower priority. Competition between members of the population with identical rank caused to win the one which has the higher crowded distance. The later generation is induced by merging the winner parents and offspring in competition and after that the population's size sets the primary length.

# 2 The proposal

The purpose has ferreted out a novelty approach to train the weights of LeCun-5 with simple

computation. It means to have no Backpropagation and derivation usage, only it needs to feedforward computations in neural networks. Therefore, our interests focus on the optimization techniques e.g.  $\mathrm{GA}^1$  Algorithms,  $\mathrm{PSO}^2$  Algorithms, etc. In short, genetic or heuristic algorithms determine the weights of LeCun-5 Neural network.

One of crucial problems is the existence of the paramount weights in LeCun-5 to apply in GA's chromosome and the other exploited the large dataset for training phase. For obviating the former weights are abated; The F6 layer has been eliminated in LeCun-5 scheme. Consequently, the length of chromosome in GA reduces to 51046 variables that have been applied in neurons' weights in LeCun-5 regime. The latter, obliged us to gain a few constant samples from the MINST dataset randomly thus, the novelty emphasizes on the LeCun-5 learning regime by exerting genetic or heuristic algorithms (our goal).

In this study, the train and test validation function have merged and 50 samples in 10 classes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) have exploited each of the iterations in the experimental algorithms. The average of errors for the entire 50 samples leads the LeCun-5 learning in objective functions of genetic or heuristic algorithms.

Our training strategy has concentrated on offline supervised learning with the batch samples and all the biases in LeCun-5 are set to zero.

The number of individual population or particles vector size is set to 100. On the left of figure 8, illustrates the output of LeCun-5's model for digit 1 and desired digit 1 as depicted the table of digits labels. For computing the errors of the LeCun-5 neural network model two appropriate functions (or computes appropriate similarity measures) have been exerted. The one has applied for homogenous of output of the LeCun-5\`neurons with labels and that one has assigned error of classifier for input pattern in the LeCun-5 model. On the right of figure 8 depicts the table of digit labels for using in supervised learning. Therefore, The  $\mathrm{RMSE}^1$  and  $\mathrm{MCR}^2$  have employed to minimize the  $\mathrm{MOP}^3$  in the NSGA-II or the other experimental algorithms which compute them with Eq 6 and Eq 7. These similarity measures are not relevant with each other. These appropriate similarity measures lead the manner of LeCun-5 regime to judicious learning thus, in the proposal, they become counterpart.

Subsequently, cost function or fitness function equivalent in MOP in the entire experimental algorithms has exerted the  $\mathrm{ax}^2 + \mathrm{by}^2$  equivalent (x denotes RMSE and y denotes MCR; a=b equal to one), except NSGA-II that has exerted respective function  $(\mathrm{ax}^2$  and  $\mathrm{by}^2$  x denote RMSE and y denotes MCR; a=b equal to one). One of the tips which has been mentioned is employing each of the equivalents in  $\mathrm{SOP}^4$  separately, obtains no pertinent resultant; their cost function and fitness function rely on power equivalent  $(\mathrm{x}^2)$ .

$$
R M S E = \sqrt {\frac {\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \left(\mathrm {X} _ {\text {o b s} , \mathrm {i}} - \mathrm {X} _ {\text {m o d e l} , \mathrm {i}}\right) ^ {2}}{\mathrm {n}}} \tag {6}
$$

Where  $\mathrm{X_{obs,i}}$  denotes value of observation in model,  $\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{model},i}$  denotes value of output desire in i location.

$$
M C R = \left(1 - \frac {M}{\mathrm {N}}\right) \times 1 0 0 \tag {7}
$$

Where M denotes sum of number of templates become correct, N denotes number of all the templates.

The LeCun-5 regime has had muddled and volatile temper with not enough learning at the experiments by exerting genetic or heuristic algorithms (the results come in columns 4 up to 7 in table 3 and table 4 for different iterations). Empirically, by tracing the observation and the manner of standard GA and standard PSO algorithm it abandons the headway of regime in learning of input pattern.

Our concentration has noted to the NSGA-II algorithm for capability of searching. Furthermore, TICA filters have initialized the parts of chromosome or particle vector inserted into the layer C1 or layer C3 in LeCun-5. The NSGA-II algorithm with the TICA filters results show in the experiments in columns 1 up to 3 in table 3 and table 4.

We have two stages with specified respective parameters and techniques in the NSGA-II algorithm usage (figure 9). In fact, assigning and restricting the heart of parameters are crucial tasks e.g. crossover, mutation, minimum and maximum range of chromosome variables. The first stage calls Pre-training and the second calls Fine-tuning.

The parameters of the NSGA-II in two stages determine at table 1. The mentioned parameters have been extracted from our experiments and a tuned LeCun-5 with online Backpropagation. Thus, they have been obtained from prior knowledge to lead and impact on the results. Moreover, the parameters should not be mangled to obtain the proposed results.

The TICA filters mediate to attainable proposal's goal magically in first stage. The results demonstrate no failure in learning by our proposal and our guess came true after survey the results and caused to achieve the solution in the essay finally.

In this idea, the parts of chromosome respective of the layer C1 and C3 in the LeCun-5 are not modified (lock them) at the first stage and only initialize them at the beginning of the NSGA-II algorithm by TICA filters from 160 filters with dimension of  $16 \times 16$  in section 1.2. They have resized to dimension of  $5 \times 5$  to fit the LeCun-5's weights matrix in respective layers (figure 10).

In The LeCun-5, each map contains a matrix with dimension of  $5 \times 5$  and a bias (bias set to 0 in our practices) in layer C1 and C3 are assigned to the rectified field (RF) or the kernel; thus, the TICA filters with dimension of  $5 \times 5$  have been replaced into these matrixes by coincidence. Another part of the chromosome is modified by the NSGA-II algorithm to set in closing layer of LeCun-5. Therefore, from the modifying the weights of closing layers ensues the classification task.

Consequently, at the ending of first stage, for the layer C1 (6 simple maps) and layer C3 (60 complex maps) earn some of the optimum LeCun-5's weights specially that undertake extracting vision features tasks e.g. edge, scale and rotation in hierarchy.

In the second stage, the 27 pertinent individuals have been selected from the preceding stage for initializing preliminary population. The entire layers' weights have been authorized unlocked in the LeCun-5 to be reconstructed by the NSGA-II algorithm caused the TICA filters to be improved to extract pertinent features in the layer C1 and C3 of the LeCun-5 scheme.

In figure 12 and 13 present graphs for RMSE and MCR errors. The 27 chromosomes have been obtained at the first stage; the results equal percentage of 1.9 and 24 for RMSE and MCR. At the second stage, the 15 chromosomes have been obtained; the RMSE and the MCR equal to 1.3 and 4 percent.

The survey in figure 12 (RMSE error) illuminates the practices 3 up to 7 have not obtained the pertinent value and the exploration has been ceased. Some of the results as column 5 reach to minimum value before iterations 100 and some of them as 3 and 7 reach to minimum gradually.

The regime in the mentioned results could not be highlighted from the practice 1 and 2; the practice 1 refers to the results of second stage and the practice 2 refers to the results of first stage.

The first Stage starts from 4.45 and down to 1.94 for the RMSE in figure 12 and the second stage renders after the first stage with initializing the population of the NSGA-II algorithm by the best results at the first stage. Consequently, the RMSE error started from 1.85 down to 1.34 point.

In figure 13, circumstances of the results for the practices 3 up to 7 imply plenty of errors in the MCR error. It means that the LeCun-5 model could not recognize task with the obtained weights in the chromosomes of population. The graph depicts the suitable results of the first and second stages for the MCR Error. At the iterations 1000 in practice 1 (second stage or fine-tuning), the number 4 has been obtained for the LeCun-5's weights in some individual's chromosomes by the NSGA-II algorithm.

Finally, in the study, a competition between the trained LeCun-5 and a derivation trained model has been practiced on the 50 samples comparing of the ability of generalization. Hence, for test phase, our assessment was carried out on 10,000 samples which were selected from the MINST dataset randomly. Our model has deduced 35 percent errors and the latter 55 percent approximately. The issue has implied on pertinent circumstance for our model in generalization subject.

Moreover, a supplementary experiment has rendered on the best result of second stage. Obtained result has surveyed in third stage and has conveyed the MCR Error has reduced from 4 down to 2 percent after 800 iterations (figure 9). On tacit assessment, the supplementary trivial result requires extreme iterations to search.

Finally, the novelties in the proposal were listed below:

1) The TICA filters dimension of  $16 \times 16$  resized to dimension of  $5 \times 5$  without being required of learning them for LeCun-5 scheme. It means researcher can apply TICA filters in their convolutional neural network with resizing them in desired condition directly; as dimension of  $16 \times 16$  to  $5 \times 5$ .

2) Supervised learning has been employed at the beginning of our proposal with TICA filters. TICA filters must be learnt by neural network by unsupervised training from natural patch images and afterward the original dataset must be taught to CNN model by supervised training.  
3) The weights of layer C1 and C3 were not modified to the end of the first stage simultaneously and afterwards allowed them to be modified in the second stage.  
4) Applying the GA algorithm, as NSGA-II trains the paramount neurons in neural networks as the LeCun-5. Subsequently, the plethora of computation is not required in derivation and Backpropagation algorithm.

# 3 Conclusion

In the study presented the procedure by applying the TICA filters and the NSGA-II genetic algorithms for training of the LeCun-5 convolutional neural network in two stages. The first stage called pre-training and the second stage called fine-tuning based on optimization solution. In fact, the TICA filters and NSGA-II algorithm with simple and useful methods in computations helped us in our proposal by setting respective parameters in the appropriate values.

The standard PSO and GA consisted of no suitable methods to train LeCun-5 as the chromosome length (weights of Lecun-5) contained frequent variables. On the other hand, the mentioned algorithms cannot reach to the satisfactory optimum point (with low RMSE and MCR values).

Practical results depicted that our method approved the impression to obtain the optimum weights of LeCun-5 on a tiny input pattern of handwritten digit recognition. In other words, the weights of the LeCun-5 convolutional neural network learnt the input pattern.

Furthermore, the proposal is capable of rendering in parallel processing on GPU and cloud computing (future proposal).
