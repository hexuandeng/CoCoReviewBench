# ABSTRACT

Transfer in Reinforcement Learning aims to improve learning performance on target tasks using knowledge from experienced source tasks. Successor features (SF) are a prominent transfer mechanism in domains where the reward function changes between tasks. They reevaluate the expected return of previously learned policies in a new target task and to transfer their knowledge. A limiting factor of the SF framework is its assumption that rewards linearly decompose into successor features and a reward weight vector. We propose a novel SF mechanism,  $\xi$ -learning, based on learning the cumulative discounted probability of successor features. Crucially,  $\xi$ -learning allows to reevaluate the expected return of policies for general reward functions. We introduce two  $\xi$ -learning variations, prove its convergence, and provide a guarantee on its transfer performance. Experimental evaluations based on  $\xi$ -learning with function approximation demonstrate the prominent advantage of  $\xi$ -learning over available mechanisms not only for general reward functions, but also in the case of linearly decomposable reward functions.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Reinforcement Learning (RL) successfully addressed many complex problems such as playing computer games, chess, and even Go with superhuman performance (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2018). These impressive results are possible thanks to a vast amount of interactions of the RL agent with its environment/task. Such strategy is unsuitable in settings where the agent has to perform and learn at the same time. Consider, for example, a care giver robot in a hospital that has to learn a new task, such as a new route to deliver meals. In such a setting, the agent can not collect a vast amount of training samples but has to adapt quickly instead. Transfer learning aims to provide mechanisms quickly to adapt agents in such settings (Taylor and Stone, 2009; Lazaric, 2012; Zhu et al., 2020). The rationale is to use knowledge from previously encountered source tasks for a new target task to improve the learning performance on the target task. The previous knowledge can help reducing the amount of interactions required to learn the new optimal behavior. For example, the care giver robot could reuse knowledge about the layout of the hospital it learned in previous source tasks (e.g. guiding a person) to learn to deliver meals.

The Successor Feature (SF) and General Policy Improvement (GPI) framework (Barreto et al., 2020) is a prominent transfer learning mechanism for tasks where only the reward function differs. Its basic premise is that the rewards which the RL agent tries to maximize are defined based on a low-dimensional feature descriptor  $\phi \in \mathbb{R}^n$ . For our care-giver robot this could be ID's of beds or rooms that it is visiting, in difference to its high-dimensional visual state input from a camera. The rewards are then computed not based on its visual input but on the ID's of the beds or rooms that it visits. The expected cumulative discounted successor features  $(\psi)$  are learned for each behavior that the robot learned in the past. It represents the dynamics in the feature space that the agent experiences for a behavior. This corresponds to the rooms or beds the care-giver agent would visit if using the behavior. This representation of feature dynamics is independent from the reward function. A behavior learned in a previous task and described by this SF representation can be directly re-evaluated for a different reward function. In a new task, i.e. for a new reward function, the GPI procedure re-evaluates the behaviors learned in previous tasks for it. It then selects at each state the behavior of a previous task if it improves the expected reward. This allows to reuse behaviors learned in previous source tasks

for a new target task. A similar transfer strategy can also be observed in the behavior of humans (Momennejad et al., 2017; Momennejad, 2020; Tomov et al., 2021).

The classical SF&GPI framework (Barreto et al., 2017; 2018) makes the assumption that rewards  $r$  are a linear composition of the features  $\phi \in \mathbb{R}^n$  via a reward weight vector  $\mathbf{w}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$  that depends on the task  $i$ :  $r_i = \phi^\top \mathbf{w}_i$ . This assumption allows to effectively separate the feature dynamics of a behavior from the rewards and thus to re-evaluate previous behaviors given a new reward function, i.e. a new weight vector  $\mathbf{w}_j$ . Nonetheless, this assumption also restricts successful application of SF&GPI only to problems where such a linear decomposition is possible. This paper investigates the application of the SF&GPI framework to general reward functions:  $r_i = R_i(\phi)$ . We propose to learn the cumulative discounted probability over the successor features, named  $\xi$ -function, and refer to the proposed framework as  $\xi$ -learning. Our work is related to Janner et al. (2020); Touati and Ollivier (2021), and brings two important additional contributions. First, we provide mathematical proof of the convergence of  $\xi$ -learning. Second, we demonstrate how  $\xi$ -learning can be used for meta-RL, using the  $\xi$ -function to re-evaluate behaviors learned in previous tasks for a new reward function  $R_j$ . Furthermore,  $\xi$ -learning can also be used to transfer knowledge to new tasks using GPI.

The contribution of our paper is three-fold:

- We introduce a new RL algorithm,  $\xi$ -learning, based on an cumulative discounted probability of successor features, and two variants of its update operator.  
- We provide theoretical proofs of the convergence of  $\xi$ -learning to the optimal policy and for a guarantee of its transfer learning performance under the GPI procedure.  
- We experimentally compare  $\xi$ -learning in tasks with linear and general reward functions, and for tasks with discrete and continuous features to standard Q-learning and the classical SF framework, demonstrating the interest and advantage of  $\xi$ -learning.

# 2 BACKGROUND

# 2.1 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

RL investigates algorithms to solve multi-step decision problems, aiming to maximize the sum over future rewards (Sutton and Barto, 2018). RL problems are modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which are defined as a tuple  $M \equiv (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, p, R, \gamma)$ , where  $\mathcal{S}$  and  $\mathcal{A}$  are the state and action set. An agent transitions from a state  $s_t$  to another state  $s_{t+1}$  using action  $a_t$  at time point  $t$  collecting a reward  $r_t$ :  $s_t \xrightarrow{a_t, r_t} s_{t+1}$ . This process is stochastic and the transition probability  $p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$  describes which state  $s_{t+1}$  is reached. The reward function  $R$  defines the scalar reward  $r_t = R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) \in \mathbb{R}$  for the transition. The goal in an MDP is to maximize the expected return  $G_t = \mathrm{E}\left[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k}\right]$ , where  $R_t = R(S_t, A_t, S_{t+1})$ . The discount factor  $\gamma \in [0,1)$  weights collected rewards by discounting future rewards stronger. RL provides algorithms to learn a policy  $\pi: S \to \mathcal{A}$  defining which action to take in which state to maximise  $G_t$ .

Value-based RL methods use the concept of value functions to learn the optimal policy. The state-action value function, called Q-function, is defined as the expected future return taking action  $a_{t}$  in  $s_t$  and then following policy  $\pi$ :

$$
Q ^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) = \mathrm {E} _ {\pi} \left\{r _ {t} + \gamma r _ {t + 1} + \gamma^ {2} r _ {t + 2} + \dots \right\} = \mathrm {E} _ {\pi} \left\{r _ {t} + \gamma \max  _ {a _ {t + 1}} Q ^ {\pi} \left(S _ {t + 1}, a _ {t + 1}\right) \right\}. \tag {1}
$$

The Q-function can be recursively defined following the Bellman equation such that the current Q-value  $Q^{\pi}(s_t, a_t)$  depends on the maximum Q-value of the next state  $Q^{\pi}(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ . The optimal policy for a MDP can then be expressed based on the Q-function, by taking at every step the maximum action:  $\pi^*(s) \in \operatorname{argmax}_a Q^*(s, a)$ .

The optimal Q-function can be learned using a temporal difference method such as Q-learning (Watkins and Dayan, 1992). For an observed transition  $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$  the Q-value is updated according to:

$$
Q _ {k + 1} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) = Q _ {k} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) + \alpha_ {k} \left(r _ {t} + \max  _ {a _ {t + 1}} Q _ {k} \left(s _ {t + 1}, a _ {t + 1}\right) - Q _ {k} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right)\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $\alpha_{k}\in (0,1]$  is the learning rate at iteration  $k$

# 2.2 TRANSFER LEARNING AND THE SF&GPI FRAMEWORK

We are interested in the transfer learning setting where the agent has to solve a set of tasks  $\mathcal{M} = \{M_1, M_2, \dots, M_m\}$ , that in our case differ only in their reward function. The Successor Feature (SF) framework provides a principled way to perform transfer learning (Barreto et al., 2017; 2018). SF assumes that the reward function can be decomposed into a linear combination of features  $\phi \in \Phi \subset \mathbb{R}^n$  and a reward weight vector  $\mathbf{w}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$  that is defined for a task  $M_i$ :

$$
r _ {i} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}, s _ {t + 1}\right) \equiv \phi \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}, s _ {t + 1}\right) ^ {\top} \mathbf {w} _ {i}. \tag {3}
$$

We refer to such reward functions as linear reward functions. Since the various tasks differ only in their reward functions, the features are the same for all tasks in  $\mathcal{M}$ .

Given the decomposition above, it is also possible to rewrite the Q-function into an expected discounted sum over future features  $\psi^{\pi_i}(s,a)$  and the reward weight vector  $\mathbf{w}_i$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q _ {i} ^ {\pi_ {i}} (s, a) = \mathrm {E} \left\{r _ {t} + \gamma^ {1} r _ {t + 1} + \gamma^ {2} r _ {t + 2} + \dots \right\} = \mathrm {E} \left\{\phi_ {t} ^ {\top} \mathbf {w} _ {i} + \gamma^ {1} \phi_ {t + 1} ^ {\top} \mathbf {w} _ {i} + \gamma^ {2} \phi_ {t + 2} ^ {\top} \mathbf {w} _ {i} + \dots \right\} \\ = \mathrm {E} \left\{\sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \gamma^ {k} \phi_ {t + k} \right\} ^ {\top} \mathbf {w} _ {i} \equiv \psi^ {\pi_ {i}} (s, a) ^ {\top} \mathbf {w} _ {i}. \tag {4} \\ \end{array}
$$

This decouples the dynamics of the policy  $\pi_i$  in the feature space of the MDP from the expected rewards for such features. Thus, it is now possible to evaluate the policy  $\pi_i$  in a different task  $M_j$  using a simple multiplication of the weight vector  $\mathbf{w}_j$  with the  $\psi$ -function:  $Q_j^{\pi_i}(s,a) = \psi^{\pi_i}(s,a)^\top \mathbf{w}_j$ . Interestingly, the  $\psi$  function also follows the Bellman equation:

$$
\psi^ {\pi} (s, a) = \mathrm {E} \left\{\phi_ {t + 1} + \gamma \psi^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t + 1}, \pi \left(s _ {t + 1}\right)\right) \mid s _ {t}, a _ {t} \right\}, \tag {5}
$$

and can therefore be learned with conventional RL methods. Moreover, (Lehnert and Littman, 2019) showed the equivalence of SF-learning to Q-learning.

Being in a new task  $M_{j}$  the Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) can be used to select the action over all policies learned so far that behaves best:

$$
\pi (s) \in \operatorname {a r g m a x} _ {a} \max  _ {i} Q _ {j} ^ {\pi_ {i}} (s, a) = \operatorname {a r g m a x} _ {a} \max  _ {i} \psi^ {\pi_ {i}} (s, a) ^ {\top} \mathbf {w} _ {j}. \tag {6}
$$

(Barreto et al., 2018) proved that under the appropriate conditions for optimal policy approximates, the policy constructed in (6) is close to the optimal one, and their difference is upper-bounded:

$$
\left| \left| Q ^ {*} - Q ^ {\pi} \right| \right| _ {\infty} \leq \frac {2}{1 - \gamma} \left(\left| \left| r - r _ {i} \right| \right| _ {\infty} + \min  _ {j} \left| \left| r _ {i} - r _ {j} \right| \right| _ {\infty} + \epsilon\right), \tag {7}
$$

where  $\| f - g \|_{\infty} = \max_{s, a} |f(s, a) - g(s, a)|$ . For an arbitrary reward function  $r$  the result can be interpreted in the following manner. Given the arbitrary task  $M$ , we identify the theoretically closest possible linear reward task  $M_i$  with  $r_i$ . For this theoretically closest task, we search the linear task  $M_j$  in our set of task  $\mathcal{M}$  (from which we also construct the GPI optimal policy (6)) which is closest to it. The upper bound between  $Q^*$  and  $Q$  is then defined by 1) the difference between task  $M$  and the theoretically closest possible linear task  $M_i$ :  $\| r - r_i \|_{\infty}$ ; and by 2) the difference between theoretical task  $M_i$  and the closest task  $M_j$ :  $\min_j \| r_i - r_j \|_{\infty}$ . If our new task  $M$  is also linear then  $r = r_i$  and the first term in (7) would vanish.

Very importantly, this result shows that the SF framework will only provide a good approximation of the true Q-function if the reward function in a task can be represented using a linear decomposition. If this is not the case then the error in the approximation increase with the distance between the true reward function  $r$  and the best linear approximation of it  $r_i$  as stated by  $||r - r_i||_{\infty}$ .

# 3 METHOD:  $\xi$  -LEARNING

# 3.1 DEFINITION AND FOUNDATIONS OF  $\xi$ -LEARNING

The goal of this paper is to investigate the application of SF&GPI to tasks with general reward functions  $R: \Phi \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  over state features  $\phi \in \Phi$ :

$$
r \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}, s _ {t + 1}\right) \equiv R \left(\phi \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}, s _ {t + 1}\right)\right) = R \left(\phi_ {t}\right), \tag {8}
$$

where we define  $\phi_t \equiv \phi(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$ . Under this assumption the Q-function can not be linearly decomposed into a part that describes feature dynamics and one that describes the rewards as in the linear SF framework (4). To overcome this issue, we propose to define the expected cumulative discounted probability of successor features or  $\xi$ -function, which is going to be the central mathematical object of the paper, as:

$$
\xi^ {\pi} (s, a, \phi) = \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \gamma^ {k} p \left(\phi_ {t + k} = \phi \mid s _ {t} = s, a _ {t} = a; \pi\right), \tag {9}
$$

where  $p(\phi_{t+k} = \phi | s_t = s, a_t = a; \pi)$ , or in short  $p(\phi_{t+k} = \phi | s_t, a_t; \pi)$ , is the probability density function of the features at time  $t + k$ , following policy  $\pi$  and conditioned to  $s$  and  $a$  being the state and action at time  $t$  respectively. Note that  $\xi^{\pi}$  depends not only on the policy  $\pi$  but also on the state transition (constant through the paper). With the definition of the  $\xi$ -function, the Q-function rewrites:

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q ^ {\pi} (s _ {t}, a _ {t}) = \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \gamma^ {k} \mathrm {E} _ {p (\phi_ {t + k} | s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi)} \left\{R (\phi_ {t + k}) \right\} = \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \gamma^ {k} \int_ {\Phi} p (\phi_ {t + k} = \phi | s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi) R (\phi) \mathrm {d} \phi \\ = \int_ {\Phi} R (\phi) \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \gamma^ {k} p (\phi_ {t + k} = \phi | s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi) \mathrm {d} \phi = \int_ {\Phi} R (\phi) \xi^ {\pi} (s _ {t}, a _ {t}, \phi) \mathrm {d} \phi . \\ \end{array}
$$

Depending on the reward function  $R$ , there are several  $\xi$ -functions that correspond to the same  $Q$  function. Formally, this is an equivalence relationship, and the quotient space has a one-to-one correspondence with the  $Q$ -function space.

Proposition 1. (Equivalence between functions  $\xi$  and  $Q$ ) Let  $\mathcal{Q} = \{Q: S \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R} \text { s.t. } \| Q \|_{\infty} < \infty\}$ . Let  $\sim$  be defined as  $\xi_1 \sim \xi_2 \Leftrightarrow \int_{\Phi} R\xi_1 = \int_{\Phi} R\xi_2$ . Then,  $\sim$  is an equivalence relationship, and there is a bijective correspondence between the quotient space  $\Xi_{\sim}$  and  $\mathcal{Q}$ .

Corollary 1. The bijection between  $\Xi_{\sim}$  and  $\mathcal{Q}$  allows to induce a norm  $\| \cdot \|_{\sim}$  into  $\Xi_{\sim}$  from the supreme norm in  $\mathcal{Q}$ , with which  $\Xi_{\sim}$  is a Banach space (since  $\mathcal{Q}$  is Banach with  $\| \cdot \|_{\infty}$ ):

$$
\left\| \xi \right\| _ {\sim} = \sup  _ {s, a} \left| \int_ {\Phi} R (\phi) \xi (s, a, \phi) d \phi \right| = \sup  _ {s, a} | Q (s, a) | = \| Q \| _ {\infty}. \tag {11}
$$

Similar to the Bellman equation for the Q-function, we can define a Bellman operator for the  $\xi$ -function, denoted by  $T_{\xi}$ , as:

$$
T _ {\xi} \left(\xi^ {\pi}\right) = p \left(\phi_ {t} = \phi \mid s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) + \gamma \mathrm {E} _ {p \left(s _ {t + 1}, a _ {t + 1} \mid s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi\right)} \left\{\xi^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t + 1}, a _ {t + 1}, \phi\right) \right\}. \tag {12}
$$

As in the case of the  $Q$ -function, we can use  $T_{\xi}$  to construct a contractive operator:

Proposition 2. ( $\xi$ -learning has a fixed point) The operator  $T_{\xi}$  is well-defined w.r.t. the equivalence  $\sim$ , and therefore induces an operator  $T_{\sim}$  defined over  $\Xi_{\sim}$ .  $T_{\sim}$  is contractive w.r.t.  $\|\cdot\|_{\sim}$ . Since  $\Xi_{\sim}$  is Banach,  $T_{\sim}$  has a unique fixed point and iterating  $T_{\sim}$  starting anywhere converges to that point.

In other words, successive applications of the operator  $T_{\sim}$  converge towards the class of optimal  $\xi$  functions  $[\xi^{*}]$  or equivalently to an optimal  $\xi$  function defined up to an additive function  $k$  satisfying  $\int_{\Phi} k(s, a, \phi) R(\phi) \mathrm{d}\phi = 0, \forall (s, a) \in S \times \mathcal{A}$  (i.e.  $k \in \operatorname{Ker}(\xi \to \int_{\Phi} R\xi)$ ).

While these two results state (see the supplementary material for the proofs) the theoretical links to standard Q-learning formulations, the  $T_{\xi}$  operator defined in (12) is not usable in practice, because of the expectation. In the next section, we define the optimisation iterate, prove its convergence, and provide two variants to perform the  $\xi$  updates.

# 3.2  $\xi$ -LEARNING ALGORITHMS

In order to learn the  $\xi$ -function, we introduce the  $\xi$ -learning update operator, which is an off-policy temporal difference method analogous to Q-learning. Given a transition  $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, \phi_t)$  the  $\xi$ -learning update operator is defined as:

$$
\xi_ {k + 1} ^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}, \phi\right) \leftarrow \xi_ {k} ^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}, \phi\right) + \alpha_ {k} \left[ p \left(\phi_ {t} = \phi \mid s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) + \gamma \xi_ {k} ^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t + 1}, \bar {a} _ {t + 1}, \phi\right) - \xi_ {k} ^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}, \phi\right) \right], \tag {13}
$$

where  $\bar{a}_{t + 1} = \operatorname {argmax}_a\int_\Phi R(\phi)\xi^\pi (s_{t + 1},a,\phi)\mathrm{d}\phi .$

The following is one of the main results of the manuscript, stating the convergence of  $\xi$ -learning:

Theorem 1. (Convergence of  $\xi$ -learning) For a sequence of state-action-feature  $\{s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, \phi_t\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$  consider the  $\xi$ -learning update given in (13). If the sequence of state-action-feature triples visits each state, action infinitely often, and if the learning rate  $\alpha_k$  is an adapted sequence satisfying the Robbins-Monro conditions:

$$
\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \alpha_ {k} = \infty , \quad \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {\infty} \alpha_ {k} ^ {2} <   \infty \tag {14}
$$

then the sequence of function classes corresponding to the iterates converges to the optimum, which corresponds to the optimal  $Q$ -function to which standard  $Q$ -learning updates would converge to:

$$
[ \xi_ {n} ] \rightarrow [ \xi^ {*} ] \quad w i t h \quad Q ^ {*} (s, a) = \int_ {\Phi} R (\phi) \xi^ {*} (s, a, \phi) d \phi . \tag {15}
$$

The proof is provided in the supplementary material and follows the same flow as for Q-learning.

The previous theorem provides convergence guarantees under the assumption that either  $p(\phi_t = \phi | s_t, a_t; \pi)$  is known, or an unbiased estimate can be constructed. In the following, we propose two different ways to approximate  $p(\phi_t = \phi | s_t, a_t; \pi)$  from a given transition  $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, \phi_t)$  so as to perform the  $\xi$ -update (13).

Model-free (MF)  $\xi$ -Learning: The first instance of  $\xi$ -learning, which we call Model-free (MF)  $\xi$ -Learning uses the same principle as standard model-free temporal difference learning methods. The update assumes for a given transition  $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, \phi_t)$  that the probability for the observed feature is  $p(\phi = \phi_t | s_t, a_t) = 1$ . Whereas for all other features ( $\forall \phi' \in \Phi, \phi' \neq \phi_t$ ) the probability is  $p(\phi' = \phi_t | s_t, a_t) = 0$ , see Appendix C for continuous features. The resulting updates are:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \phi = \phi_ {t}: \quad \xi^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}, \phi\right) \quad \leftarrow \quad (1 - \alpha) \xi^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}, \phi\right) + \alpha \left(1 + \gamma \xi^ {\pi} \left(s _ {t + 1}, \bar {a} _ {t + 1}, \phi\right)\right) \tag {16} \\ \phi^ {\prime} \neq \phi_ {t}: \xi^ {\pi} (s _ {t}, a _ {t}, \phi^ {\prime}) \leftarrow (1 - \alpha) \xi^ {\pi} (s _ {t}, a _ {t}, \phi^ {\prime}) + \alpha \gamma \xi^ {\pi} (s _ {t + 1}, \bar {a} _ {t + 1}, \phi^ {\prime}). \\ \end{array}
$$

Due to the stochastic update of the  $\xi$ -function and if the learning rate  $\alpha \in (0,1]$  discounts over time, the  $\xi$ -update will learn the true probability of  $p(\phi = \phi_t|s_t,a_t)$ . A problematic point with the MF procedure is that it induces potentially a high variance when the true feature probabilities are not binary. To cope with this potentially negative effect, we propose a different variant.

One-Step SF Model (MB)  $\xi$ -Learning: We introduce a second  $\xi$ -learning procedure called One-step SF Model (MB)  $\xi$ -Learning that attempts to reduce the variance of the update. To do so, MB  $\xi$ -Learning estimates the distribution over the successor features over time. Let  $\tilde{p}(\phi_t = \phi | s_t, a_t; \pi)$  denote the current estimate of the feature distribution. Given a transition  $(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, \phi_t)$  the model is updated according to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \phi = \phi_ {t}: \quad \tilde {p} _ {\phi} (\phi | s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi) \quad \leftarrow \quad \tilde {p} _ {\phi} (\phi | s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi) + \beta \left(1 - \tilde {p} _ {\phi} (\phi | s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi)\right) \tag {17} \\ \phi^ {\prime} \neq \phi_ {t}: \tilde {p} _ {\phi} (\phi^ {\prime} | s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi) \leftarrow \tilde {p} _ {\phi} (\phi^ {\prime} | s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi) - \beta \tilde {p} _ {\phi} (\phi^ {\prime} | s _ {t}, a _ {t}; \pi), \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\beta \in [0,1]$  is the learning rate. After updating the model  $\tilde{p}_{\phi}$ , it can be used for the  $\xi$ -update as defined in (13). Since the learned model  $\tilde{p}_{\phi}$  is independent from the reward function and from the policy, it can be learned and used over all tasks.

# 3.3 META  $\xi$ -LEARNING

After discussing  $\xi$ -learning on a single task and showing its theoretical convergence, we can now investigate how it can be applied in transfer learning. Similar to the linear SF framework the  $\xi$ -function allows to reevaluate a policy learned for task  $M_{i}$ ,  $\xi^{\pi_i}$ , in a new environment  $M_{j}$ :

$$
Q _ {j} ^ {\pi_ {i}} (s, a) = \int_ {\Phi} R _ {j} (\phi) \xi^ {\pi_ {i}} (s, a, \phi) \mathrm {d} \phi . \tag {18}
$$

This allows us to apply GPI in (6) for arbitrary reward functions in a similar manner to what was proposed for linear reward functions in (Barreto et al., 2018). We extend the GPI result to the  $\xi$ -learning framework as follows:

Theorem 2. (Generalised policy improvement in  $\xi$ -learning) Let  $\mathcal{M}$  be the set of tasks, each one associated to a (possibly different) weighting function  $R_{i} \in L^{1}(\Phi)$ . Let  $\xi^{\pi_{i}^{*}}$  be a representative of the optimal class of  $\xi$ -functions for task  $M_{i}$ ,  $i \in \{1, \dots, I\}$ , and let  $\tilde{\xi}^{\pi_{i}}$  be an approximation to the optimal  $\xi$ -function,  $\| \xi^{\pi_{i}^{*}} - \tilde{\xi}^{\pi_{i}} \|_{R_{i}} \leq \varepsilon, \forall i$ . Then, for another task  $M$  with weighting function  $R$ , the policy defined as:

$$
\pi (s) = \arg \max  _ {a} \max  _ {i} \int_ {\Phi} R (\phi) \tilde {\xi} ^ {\pi_ {i}} (s, a, \phi) d \phi , \tag {19}
$$

satisfies:

$$
\left\| \xi^ {*} - \xi^ {\pi} \right\| _ {R} \leq \frac {2}{1 - \gamma} \left(\min  _ {i} \| R - R _ {i} \| _ {p (\phi | s, a)} + \varepsilon\right), \tag {20}
$$

where  $\| f\| _g = \sup_{s,a}\int_{\Phi}|f\cdot g|d\phi$

We evaluated  $\xi$ -learning in two environments. The first has discrete features. It is a modified version of the object collection task by Barreto et al. (2017). We introduced to it features with higher complexity allowing the usage of general reward functions. See Appendix D.1 for experimental results in the original environment. The second environment, the racer environment, evaluates the agents in tasks with continuous features.

# 4.1 DISCRETE FEATURES - OBJECT COLLECTION ENVIRONMENT

**Environment:** The environment consists of 4 rooms (Fig. 1, a). The agent starts an episode in position S and has to learn to reach the goal position G. During an episode, the agent can collect objects to gain further rewards. Each object has 2 properties: 1) color: orange or blue, and 2) form: box or triangle. The state space is a high-dimensional vector  $s \in \mathbb{R}^{112}$ . It encodes the agent's position using a  $10 \times 10$  grid of two-dimensional Gaussian radial basis functions. Moreover, it includes a memory about which object as been already collected. Agents can move in 4 directions. The features  $\phi \in \Phi = \{0,1\}^5$  are binary vectors. The first 2 dimensions encode if an orange or a blue object was picked up. The 2 following dimensions encode the form. The last dimension encodes if the agent reached goal G. For example,  $\phi^\top = [1,0,1,0,0]$  encodes that the agent picked up an orange box.

Tasks: Each agent learns sequentially 300 tasks which differ in their reward for collecting objects. We compared agents in two settings: either in tasks with linear or general reward functions. For each linear task  $\mathcal{M}_i$ , the rewards  $r = \phi^\top \mathbf{w}_i$  are defined by a linear combination of features and a weight vector  $\mathbf{w}_i \in \mathbb{R}^5$ . The weights  $w_{i,k}$  for the first 4 dimensions define the rewards for collecting an object with a specific property. They are randomly sampled from a uniform distribution:  $w_{i,k} \sim \mathcal{U}(-1,1)$ . The final weight defines the reward for reaching the goal position which is  $w_{i,5} = 1$  for each task. The general reward functions are sampled by assigning a different reward to each possible combination of object properties  $\phi_j \in \Phi$  using uniform sampling:  $R_i(\phi_j) \sim \mathcal{U}(-1,1)$ , such that picking up an orange box might result in a reward of  $R_i(\phi^\top = [1,0,1,0,0]) = 0.23$ .

Agents: We compared  $\xi$ -learning to Q-learning (QL), and classical SF Q-learning (SFQL) (Barreto et al., 2017). All agents use function approximation for their state-action functions (Q,  $\psi$ , or  $\xi$ -function). An independent linear mapping is used to map the values from the state for each of the 4 actions. As the features are discrete, the  $\xi$ -function and  $\hat{p}_{\phi}$ -model are approximated by an independent mapping for each action and possible feature  $\phi \in \Phi$ . The Q-value  $Q(s,a)$  for the  $\xi$ -agents (Eq. 10) is computed by:  $Q^{\pi}(s,a) = \sum_{\phi \in \Phi} R(\phi) \xi^{\pi}(s,a,\phi)$ . The reward functions of each task are given to the  $\xi$ -agents. For SFQL, the sampled reward weights  $\mathbf{w}_i$  were given in tasks with linear reward functions. For general reward functions, a linear model  $r = \phi^\top \tilde{\mathbf{w}}_i$  approximating the rewards was learned for each task and its weights  $\tilde{\mathbf{w}}_i$  given to SFQL. Each tasks was executed for 20,000 steps, and the average performance over 10 runs per algorithm was measured. We performed a grid-search over the parameters of each agent, reporting here the performance of the parameters with the highest total reward over all tasks.

Figure 1: In the (a) object collection environment,  $\xi$ -learning reached the highest average reward per task for (b) linear, and (d) general reward functions. The average over 10 runs per algorithm and the standard error of the mean are depicted. (c) The performance difference between  $\xi$ -learning and SFQL is stronger for general reward tasks that have high non-linearity, i.e. where a linear reward model yields a high error. SFQL can only reach less than  $50\%$  of MF  $\xi$ -learning's performance in tasks with a mean linear reward model error of 1.625.  
(d) Tasks with General Reward Functions

Results:  $\xi$ -learning outperformed SFQL and QL for tasks with linear and general reward functions (Fig. 1, b, d). MF showed a slight advantage over MB  $\xi$ -learning in both settings. We further studied the effect non-linearity of general reward functions on the performance of classical SF compared to  $\xi$ -learning by evaluating them in tasks with different levels of non-linearity. We sampled general reward functions that resulted in different levels of mean absolute model error if they are linearly approximated with  $\min_{\tilde{\mathbf{w}}} |r(\phi) - \boldsymbol{\phi}^{\top}\tilde{\mathbf{w}}|$ . We trained SFQL and MF  $\xi$ -learning in each of these conditions on 300 tasks and measured the ratio between the total return of SFQL and MF  $\xi$  (Fig. 1). The relative performance of SFQL compared to MF  $\xi$  reduces with higher non-linearity of the reward functions. For reward functions that are nearly linear (mean error of 0.125), both have a similar performance. Whereas, for reward functions that are difficult to model with a linear relation (mean error of 1.625) SFQL reaches only less than  $50\%$  of the performance of  $\xi$ -learning. This follows SFQL's theoretical limitation in (7) and shows the advantage of  $\xi$  learning over SFQL in non-linear reward tasks.

# 4.2 CONTINUOUS FEATURES - RACER ENVIRONMENT

Environment and Tasks: We further evaluated the agents in an environment with continuous features (Fig. 2, a). The agent is randomly placed in the environment and has to drive around for 200 timesteps before the episode ends. Similar to a car, the agent has an orientation and momentum, so that it can only drive straight, or in a right or left curve. The agent reappears on the opposite side if it exits one side. The distance to 3 markers are provided as features  $\phi \in \mathbb{R}^3$ . Rewards depend on the distances  $r = \sum_{k=1}^{3} r_k \phi_k$ , where each component  $r_k$  has 1 or 2 preferred distances defined by Gaussian functions. For each of the 45 tasks, the number of Gaussian's and their properties  $(\mu, \sigma)$  are randomly sampled for each feature dimension. Fig. 2 (a) shows a reward function with dark areas depicting higher rewards. The agent has to learn to drive around in such a way as to maximize its trajectory over positions with high rewards. The state space is a high-dimensional vector  $s \in \mathbb{R}^{120}$  encoding the agent's position and orientation. As before, the 2D position is encoded using a  $10 \times 10$  grid of two-dimensional Gaussian radial basis functions. Similarly, the orientation is also encoded using 20 Gaussian radial basis functions.

(a) Racer Environment

Figure 2: (a) Example of a reward function for the racer environment based on distances to its 3 markers. (b)  $\xi$ -learning reaches the highest average reward per task. SFQL yields a performance even below QL as it is not able to model the reward function with its linear combination of weights and features. The average over 10 runs per agent and the standard error of the mean are depicted.  
(b) Tasks with General Reward Functions

Agents: We introduce a MF  $\xi$ -agent for continuous features (CMF  $\xi$ ) (Appendix C.2.1). CMF  $\xi$  discretizes each feature dimension  $\phi_k \in [0,1]$  in 11 bins with the bin centers:  $X = \{0.0,0.1,\dots,1.0\}$ . It learns for each dimension  $k$  and bin  $i$  the  $\xi$ -value  $\xi_k^\pi(s,a,X_i)$ . Q-values (Eq. 10) are computed by:  $Q^\pi(s,a) = \sum_{k=1}^{3} \sum_{i=1}^{11} r_k(X_i) \xi_k^\pi(s,a,X_i)$ . SFQL received an approximated weight vector  $\tilde{\mathbf{w}}_i$  that was trained before the task started on several uniformly sampled features and rewards.

Results:  $\xi$ -learning reached the highest performance of all agents (Fig. 2, b). SFQL reaches only a low performance below QL, because it is not able to sufficiently well approximate the general reward functions with its linear reward model.  $\xi$ -learning can only slightly improve over QL, showing that SF&GPI transfer in this environment is less efficient than in the object collection environment (Fig.1).

# 5 DISCUSSION

$\xi$ -learning in Tasks with General Reward Functions:  $\xi$ -learning allows to disentangle the dynamics of policies in the feature space of a task from the associated reward, see (10). The experimental evaluation in tasks with general reward functions (Fig. 1-d, and Fig. 2) show that  $\xi$ -learning can therefore successfully apply GPI to transfer knowledge from learned tasks to new ones. Given a general reward function it can re-evaluate successfully learned policies for knowledge transfer. Instead, classical SFQL based on a linear decomposition (3) can not be directly applied given a general reward function. In this case a linear approximation has to be learned which shows inferior performance to  $\xi$ -learning that directly uses the true reward function.

$\xi$ -learning in Tasks with Linear Reward Functions:  $\xi$ -Learning also shows an increased performance over SFQL in environments with linear reward functions (Fig. 1-a). This effect can not be attributed to differences in their computation of the expected return of a policy as both are correct. A possible explanation could be that  $\xi$ -learning reduces the complexity for the function approximation of the  $\xi$ -function compared to the  $\psi$ -function in SFQL.

Continuous Feature Spaces: For tasks with continuous features (racer environment),  $\xi$ -learning used successfully a discretization of each feature dimension, and learned the  $\xi$ -values independently for each dimension. This strategy is viable for reward functions that are cumulative over the feature dimensions:  $r(\phi) = \sum_{k} r_k \phi_k$ . The Q-value can be computed by summing over the independent dimensions and the bins  $X$ :  $Q^{\pi}(s, a) = \sum_{k} \sum_{x \in X} r_k(x) \xi^{\pi}(s, a, x)$ . For more general reward functions, the space of all feature combinations would need to be discretized, which grows exponentially with each new dimension. As a solution the  $\xi$ -function could be directly defined over the continuous feature space, but this yields some problems. First, the computation of the expected return requires an integral  $Q(s, a) = \int_{\phi \in \Phi} R(\phi) \xi(s, a, \phi)$  over features instead of a sum, which is a priori intractable. Second, the representation and training of the  $\xi$ -function, which would be defined over a continuum thus increasing the difficulty of approximating the function. Janner et al. (2020) and Touati and Ollivier (2021) propose methods that might allow to represent a continuous  $\xi$ -function, but it is unclear if they converge and if they can be used for transfer learning.

Computational Complexity: The improved performance of SFQL and  $\xi$ -learning over QL in the transfer learning setting comes at the cost of an increased computational complexity. The GPI procedure (6) of both approaches requires to evaluate at each step the  $\psi^{\pi_i}$ -function or  $\xi^{\pi_i}$ -function over all previous experienced tasks in  $\mathcal{M}$ . As a consequence, the computational complexity increases linearly with each new environment that is added. A solution is to apply GPI only over a subset of learned policies. Nonetheless, an open question is still how to optimally select this subset.

# 6 RELATED WORK

Transfer Learning: Transfer methods in RL can be generally categorized according to the type of tasks between which transfer is possible and the type of transferred knowledge (Taylor and Stone, 2009; Lazaric, 2012; Zhu et al., 2020). In the case of SF&GPI which  $\xi$ -learning is part of, tasks only differ in their reward functions. The type of knowledge that is transferred are policies learned in source tasks which are re-evaluated in the target task and recombined using the GPI procedure. A natural use-case for  $\xi$ -learning are continual problems (Khetarpal et al., 2020) where an agent has continually adapt to changing tasks, which are in our setting different reward functions.

Successor Features: SF are based on the concept of successor representations (Dayan, 1993; Momennejad, 2020). Successor representations predict the future occurrence of all states for a policy in the same manner as SF for features. Their application is restricted to low-dimensional state spaces using tabular representations. SF extended them to domains with high-dimensional state spaces (Kulkarni et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Barreto et al., 2017; 2018), by predicting the future occurrence of low-dimensional features that are relevant to define the return. Several extensions to the SF framework have been proposed. One direction aims to learn appropriate features from data such as by optimally reconstruct rewards (Barreto et al., 2017), using the concept of mutual information (Hansen et al., 2019), or the grouping of temporal similar states (Madjiheurem and Toni, 2019). Another direction is the generalization of the  $\psi$ -function over policies (Borsa et al., 2018) analogous to universal value function approximation (Schaul et al., 2015). Similar approaches use successor maps (Madarasz, 2019), goal-conditioned policies (Ma et al., 2020), or successor feature sets (Brantley et al., 2021). Other directions include their application to POMDPs (Vértes and Sahani, 2019), combination with max-entropy principles (Vertes, 2020), or hierarchical RL (Barreto et al., 2021). In difference to  $\xi$ -learning all these approaches build on the assumption of linear reward functions, whereas  $\xi$ -learning allows the SF&GPI framework to be used with general reward functions. Nonetheless, most of the extensions for linear SF can be combined with  $\xi$ -learning.

Model-based RL: SF represent the dynamics of a policy in the feature space that is decoupled from the rewards allowing to reevaluate them under different reward functions. It shares therefore similar properties with model-based RL (Lehnert and Littman, 2019). In general, model-based RL methods learn a one-step model of the environment dynamics  $p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$ . Given a policy and an arbitrary reward function, rollouts can be performed using the learned model to evaluate the return. In practice, the rollouts have a high variance for long-term predictions rendering them ineffective. Recently, (Janner et al., 2020) proposed the  $\gamma$ -model framework that learns to represent  $\xi$ -values in continuous domains. Nonetheless, the application to transfer learning is not discussed and no convergence is proven as for  $\xi$ -learning. This is the same case for the forward-backward MPD representation proposed in Touati and Ollivier (2021). (Tang et al., 2021) also proposes to decouple the dynamics in the state space from the rewards, but learn an internal representation of the rewards. This does not allow to reevaluate an policy to a new reward function without relearning the mapping.

# 7 CONCLUSION

The introduced  $\xi$ -learning framework learns the expected cumulative discounted probability of successor features which disentangles the dynamics of a policy in the feature space of a task from the expected rewards. This allows  $\xi$ -learning to reevaluate the expected return of learned policies for general reward functions and to use it for transfer learning utilizing GPI. We proved that  $\xi$ -learning converges to the optimal policy, and showed experimentally its improved performance over Q-learning and the classical SF framework for tasks with linear and general reward functions.

# ETHICS STATEMENT

$\xi$ -learning and its associated optimization algorithms represent general RL procedures similar to Q-learning. Their potential negative societal impact depends on their application domains which range over all possible societal areas in a similar manner as for other general RL procedures.

Beyond the topic of the paper, we did our best to cite the relevant literature and to fairly compare with previous ideas, concepts and methods. To that aim, all agents are trained and evaluated within the same software environment, and under the very same experimental settings.
