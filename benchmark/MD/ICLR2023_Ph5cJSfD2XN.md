# ABSTRACT

Many datasets are biased, namely they contain easy-to-learn features that are highly correlated with the target class only in the dataset but not in the true underlying distribution of the data. For this reason, learning unbiased models from biased data has become a very relevant research topic in the last years. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning representations that are robust to biases. We first present a margin-based theoretical framework that allows us to clarify why recent contrastive losses (InfoNCE, SupCon, etc.) can fail when dealing with biased data. Based on that, we derive a novel formulation of the supervised contrastive loss ( $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE), providing more accurate control of the minimal distance between positive and negative samples. Furthermore, thanks to our theoretical framework, we also propose FairKL, a new debiasing regularization loss, that works well even with extremely biased data. We validate the proposed losses on standard vision datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, and we assess the debiasing capability of FairKL with  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE, reaching state-of-the-art performance on a number of biased datasets, including real instances of biases "in the wild".

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep learning models have become the predominant tool for learning representations suited for a variety of tasks. Arguably, the most common setup for training deep neural networks in supervised classification tasks consists in minimizing the cross-entropy loss. Cross-entropy drives the model towards learning the correct label distribution for a given sample. However, it has been shown in many works that this loss can be affected by biases in the data (Alvi et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019; Nam et al., 2020; Sagawa et al., 2019; Tartaglione et al., 2021; Torralba et al., 2011) or suffer by noise and corruption in the labels Elsayed et al. (2018); Graf et al. (2021). Learning fair and robust representations of the underlying samples, especially when dealing with highly-biased data, is the main objective of this work. Contrastive learning has recently gained attention for this purpose, and many different losses and frameworks have been proposed (Chen et al., 2020; Khosla et al., 2020; Oord et al., 2019; Poole et al., 2019). Supervised contrastive learning approaches aim at pulling representations of the same class closer together while repelling representations of different classes apart from each other. It has been shown that, in a supervised setting, this kind of optimization can yield better results than standard cross-entropy (Khosla et al., 2020), and is also more robust against label corruption (Graf et al., 2021).

In the latest years, it has become increasingly evident how neural networks tend to rely on simple patterns in the data (Geirhos et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021). As deep neural networks grow in size and complexity, guaranteeing that they do not learn spurious elements in the training set is becoming a pressuring issue to tackle. It is indeed a known fact that most of the commonly-used datasets are biased (Torralba et al., 2011) and that this affects the learned models (Tommasi et al., 2017). In particular, when the biases correlate very well with the target task, it is hard to obtain predictions that are independent of the biases. Furthermore, if the bias is easy to learn (e.g. a simple pattern or color), we will most likely obtain a biased model, whose predictions majorly rely on these spurious attributes and not on the true, generalizable, and discriminative features.

In this work, we adopt a metric learning approach for supervised representation learning. Based on that, we provide a unified framework to analyze and compare existing formulations of contrastive losses such as the InfoNCE loss (Chen et al., 2020; Oord et al., 2019), the InfoL1O loss (Poole et al., 2019) and the SupCon loss (Khosla et al., 2020). Furthermore, we also propose a new supervised

Figure 1: With  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE (a) we aim at increasing the minimal margin  $\epsilon$ , between the distance  $d^{+}$  of a positive sample  $x^{+}$  (+ symbol inside) from an anchor  $x$  and the distance  $d^{-}$  of the closest negative sample  $x^{-}$  (- symbol inside). By increasing the margin, we can achieve a better separation between positive and negative samples. We show two different scenarios without margin (b) and with margin (c). Filling colors of datapoints represent different biases. We observe that, without imposing a margin, biased clusters might appear containing both positive and negative samples (b). This issue can be mitigated by increasing the  $\epsilon$  margin (c).

contrastive loss that can be seen as the simplest extension of the InfoNCE loss (Chen et al., 2020; Oord et al., 2019) to a supervised setting with multiple positives. Using the proposed metric learning approach, we can reformulate each loss as a set of contrastive, and surprisingly sometimes even non-contrastive, conditions. We show that the widely used SupCon loss is not a "straightforward" extension of the InfoNCE loss since it actually contains a set of "latent" non-contrastive constraints. Our analysis results in an in-depth understanding of the different loss functions, fully explaining their behavior from a metric point of view.

Furthermore, by leveraging the proposed metric learning approach, we explore the issue of biased learning. We outline the limitations of the studied contrastive loss functions when dealing with biased data, even if the loss on the training set is apparently minimized. By analyzing such cases, we provide a more formal characterization of bias. This eventually allows us to derive a new set of regularization constraints for debiasing that is general and can be added to any contrastive or non-contrastive loss. Our contributions are summarized below:

1. We introduce a simple but powerful theoretical framework for supervised representation learning, from which we derive different contrastive loss functions. We show how existing contrastive losses can be expressed within our framework, providing a uniform understanding of the different formulations. We derive a generalized form of the SupCon loss  $(\epsilon\text{-SupCon})$ , propose a novel loss  $\epsilon\text{-SupInfoNCE}$ , and demonstrate empirically its effectiveness;  
2. We provide a more formal definition of bias, thanks to the proposed metric learning approach, which is based on the distances among representations, This allows us to derive a new set of effective debiasing regularization constraints, which we call FairKL. We also analyze, theoretically and empirically, the debiasing power of the different contrastive losses, comparing  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE and SupCon.

# 2 RELATED WORKS

Our contribution is based on the related literature in contrastive learning, metric learning, fairness, and debiasing. Addressing the issue of biased data and how it affects generalization in neural networks has been the subject of numerous works. For example, some approaches in this direction include the use of different data sources in order to mitigate biases (Gupta et al., 2018) and data clean-up thanks to the use of a GAN (Sattigeri et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018). However, they share some major limitations due to the complexity of working directly on the data. A more throughout understanding of how deep models can learn powerful representations can certainly be helpful in all of the above cases. In the debiasing related literature, we can most often find approaches based on

ensembling methods, adversarial setups, or regularization terms that aim at obtaining an unbiased model using biased data. The typical adversarial approach is represented by BlindEye (Alvi et al., 2018). They employ an explicit bias classifier, trained on the same representation space as the target classifier, in an adversarial way, forcing the encoder to extract unbiased representations. This is also similar to Xie et al. (2017). Kim et al. (2019) use adversarial learning and gradient inversion to reach the same goal. Wang et al. (2019b) adopt an adversarial approach to remove unwanted features from intermediate representations of a neural network. All of these works share the limitations of adversarial training, which is well known for its potential training instability. Some other ensembling approaches can be found in Clark et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2020), where feature independence among the different models is promoted. Bahng et al. (2020) propose ReBias, an ensembling-based technique, in which the optimization process consists in solving a min-max problem with the aim of promoting independence between biased representations and unbiased ones. A similar setup is described in (Lee et al., 2021), where disentanglement between bias features and target features is maximized to perform the augmentation in the latent space. Nam et al. (2020) propose a technique named Learning from Failure (LfF). They exploit the training dynamics: a bias-capturing model is trained with a focus on easier samples, using the Generalized Cross-Entropy (Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018) (GCE) loss, which are assumed to be aligned with the bias, while a debiased network is trained by giving more importance to the samples that the bias-capturing model struggles to discriminate. Similar assumptions are also made by Luo et al. (2022), where GCE is used for dealing with biases in a medical setting using Chest X-Ray images. In RUBi (Cadene et al., 2019), logits re-weighting is used to promote the independence of the predictions on the bias features. Another kind of approach is proposed in Wang et al. (2019a) with HEX, where a differentiable neural-network-based gray-level co-occurrence matrix (Haralick et al., 1973; Lam, 1996), is employed for learning invariant representations to some bias. Ji et al. (2019) propose an unsupervised clustering method that is able to learn representations invariant to some unknown or "distractor" classes in the data, by employing over-clustering. Obtaining representations that are robust and/or invariant to some secondary attribute can also be achieved by applying constraints and regularization to the model. For example, recent works attempt to discourage the learning of certain features directly inside the model, towards data privacy (Barbano et al., 2021; Song et al., 2017) and fairness (Beutel et al., 2019). For example, Sagawa et al. (2019) propose Group-DRO, which aims at improving the model performance on the worst-group in the training set, defined based on prior knowledge of the bias distribution. Tartaglione et al. (2021) propose EnD, which is a regularization term that aims at bringing representations of positive samples closer together in case of different biases, and pulling apart representations of negative samples sharing the same bias attributes. A similar method is presented in (Hong & Yang, 2021), where a contrastive formulation is employed to reach a similar goal.

# 3 CONTRASTIVE LEARNING: AN  $\epsilon$ -MARGIN POINT OF VIEW

Let  $x \in \mathcal{X}$  be an original sample (i.e., anchor),  $x_{i}^{+}$  a similar (positive) sample,  $x_{j}^{-}$  a dissimilar (negative) sample and  $P$  and  $N$  the number of positive and negative samples respectively. Contrastive learning methods look for a parametric mapping function  $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$  that maps "semantically" similar samples close together in the representation space (a (d-1)-sphere) and dissimilar samples far away from each other. Once pre-trained,  $f$  is fixed and its representation is evaluated on a downstream task, such as classification, through linear evaluation on a test set. In general, positive samples  $x_{i}^{+}$  can be defined in different ways depending on the problem: using transformations of  $x$  (unsupervised setting), samples belonging to the same class as  $x$  (supervised) or with similar image attributes of  $x$  (weakly-supervised). The definition of negative samples  $x_{j}^{-}$  varies accordingly. Here, we focus on the supervised case, thus samples belonging to the same/different class, but the proposed framework could be easily applied to the other cases. We define  $s(f(a), f(b))$  as a similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity) between the representation of two samples  $a$  and  $b$ . Please note that since  $||f(a)||_2 = ||f(b)||_2 = 1$ , using a cosine similarity is equivalent to using a L2-distance  $(d(f(a), f(b)) = ||f(a) - f(b)||_2^2)$ .

Similarly to Chopra et al. (2005); Hadsell et al. (2006); Schroff et al. (2015); Sohn (2016); Wang et al. (2014; 2019c); Weinberger et al. (2006); Yu & Tao (2019), we propose to use a metric learning approach which allows us to better formalize recent contrastive losses, such as InfoNCE (Chen et al., 2020; Oord et al., 2019), InfoL1O (Poole et al., 2019) and SupCon (Khosla et al., 2020), and derive new losses that better approximate the mutual information and can take into account data biases.

Using an  $\epsilon$ -margin metric learning point of view, probably the simplest contrastive learning formulation is looking for a mapping function  $f$  such that the following  $\epsilon$ -condition is always satisfied:

$$
\underbrace {d \left(f (x) , f \left(x ^ {+}\right)\right)} _ {d ^ {+}} - \underbrace {d \left(f (x) , f \left(x _ {j} ^ {-}\right)\right)} _ {d _ {j} ^ {-}} <   - \epsilon \Longleftrightarrow \underbrace {s \left(f (x) , f \left(x _ {j} ^ {-}\right)\right)} _ {s _ {j} ^ {-}} - \underbrace {s \left(f (x) , f \left(x ^ {+}\right)\right)} _ {s ^ {+}} \leq - \epsilon \quad \forall j \tag {1}
$$

where  $\epsilon \geq 0$  is a margin between positive and negative samples and we consider, for now, a single positive sample.

Derivation of InfoNCE The constraint of Eq. 1 can be transformed in an optimization problem using, as it is common in contrastive learning, the max operator and its smooth approximation LogSumExp (full derivation in the Appendix A.1.1):

$$
s _ {j} ^ {-} - s ^ {+} \leq - \epsilon \quad \forall j
$$

$$
\underset {f} {\arg \min } \max  (- \epsilon , \left\{s _ {j} ^ {-} - s ^ {+} \right\} _ {j = 1, \dots , N}) \approx \underset {f} {\arg \min } \underbrace {- \log \left(\frac {\exp \left(s ^ {+}\right)}{\exp \left(s ^ {+} - \epsilon\right) + \sum_ {j} \exp \left(s _ {j} ^ {-}\right)}\right)} _ {\epsilon - I n f o N C E} \tag {2}
$$

Here, we can notice that when  $\epsilon = 0$ , we retrieve the InfoNCE loss, whereas when  $\epsilon \rightarrow \infty$  we obtain the InfoL1O loss. It has been shown in Poole et al. (2019) that these two losses are lower and upper bound of the Mutual Information  $I(X^{+},X)$  respectively:

$$
\underbrace {\log \frac {\exp s ^ {+}}{\exp s ^ {+} + \sum_ {j} \exp s _ {j} ^ {-}}} _ {\text {I n f o N C E}} \leq I (X ^ {+}, X) \leq \underbrace {\log \frac {\exp s ^ {+}}{\sum_ {j} \exp s _ {j} ^ {-}}} _ {\text {I n f o L 1 O}} \tag {3}
$$

By using a value of  $\epsilon \in [0,\infty)$ , one might find a tighter approximation of  $I(X^{+},X)$  since the exponential function at the denominator  $\exp (-\epsilon)$  monotonically decreases as  $\epsilon$  increases.

Proposed supervised loss ( $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE) The inclusion of multiple positive samples ( $s_i^+$ ) can lead to different formulations. Some of them can be found in the Appendix A.1.2. Here, considering a supervised setting, we propose to use the following one, that we call  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE:

$$
s _ {j} ^ {-} - s _ {i} ^ {+} \leq - \epsilon \quad \forall i, j
$$

$$
\sum_ {i} \max  (- \epsilon , \{s _ {j} ^ {-} - s _ {i} ^ {+} \} _ {j = 1, \dots , N}) \approx \underbrace {- \sum_ {i} \log \left(\frac {\exp (s _ {i} ^ {+})}{\exp (s _ {i} ^ {+} - \epsilon) + \sum_ {j} \exp (s _ {j} ^ {-})}\right)} _ {\epsilon - S u p I n f o N C E} \tag {4}
$$

Please note that this loss could also be used in other settings, like in an unsupervised one, where positive samples could be defined as transformations of the anchor. Furthermore, even here, the  $\epsilon$  value can be adjusted in the loss function, in order to increase the  $\epsilon$ -margin. This time, contrarily to what happens with Eq. 2 and InfoNCE, if we consider  $\epsilon = 0$ , we do not obtain the SupCon loss.

Derivation of  $\epsilon$ -SupCon (generalized SupCon) It's interesting to notice that Eq. 4 is similar to  $\mathcal{L}_{out}^{sup}$ , which is one of the two SupCon losses proposed in Khosla et al. (2020), but they differ for a sum over the positive samples at the denominator. The  $\mathcal{L}_{out}^{sup}$  loss, presented as the "most straightforward way to generalize" the InfoNCE loss, actually contains another non-contrastive constraint on the positive samples:  $s_t^+ - s_i^+ \leq 0$ $\forall i, t$ . Fulfilling this condition alone would force all positive samples to collapse to a single point in the representation space. However, it does not take into account negative samples. That is why we define it as a non-contrastive condition. Considering both contrastive and non-contrastive conditions, we obtain:

$$
s _ {j} ^ {-} - s _ {i} ^ {+} \leq - \epsilon \quad \forall i, j \quad \text {a n d} \quad s _ {t} ^ {+} - s _ {i} ^ {+} \leq 0 \quad \forall i, t \neq i
$$

$$
\frac {1}{P} \sum_ {i} \max  \left(0, \left\{s _ {j} ^ {-} - s _ {i} ^ {+} + \epsilon \right\} _ {j}, \left\{s _ {t} ^ {+} - s _ {i} ^ {+} \right\} _ {t \neq i}\right) \approx \underbrace {\epsilon - \frac {1}{P} \sum_ {i} \log \left(\frac {\exp \left(s _ {i} ^ {+}\right)}{\sum_ {t} \exp \left(s _ {t} ^ {+} - \epsilon\right) + \sum_ {j} \exp \left(s _ {j} ^ {-}\right)}\right)} _ {\epsilon - S u p C o n} \tag {5}
$$

when  $\epsilon = 0$  we retrieve exactly  $\mathcal{L}_{out}^{sup}$ . The second loss proposed in Khosla et al. (2020), called  $\mathcal{L}_{in}^{sup}$ , minimizes a different contrastive problem, which is a less strict condition and probably explains the fact that this loss did not work well in practice (Khosla et al., 2020):

$$
\max  \left(s _ {j} ^ {-}\right) <   \max  \left(s _ {i} ^ {+}\right) \approx \log \left(\sum_ {j} \exp \left(s _ {j} ^ {-}\right)\right) - \log \left(\sum_ {i} \exp \left(s _ {i} ^ {+}\right)\right) <   0 \tag {6}
$$

$$
\underset {f} {\arg \min } \max  (0, \max  (s _ {j} ^ {-}) - \max  (s _ {i} ^ {+})) \approx \underbrace {- \log \left(\sum_ {i} \frac {\exp \left(s _ {i} ^ {+}\right)}{\sum_ {t} \exp \left(s _ {t} ^ {+}\right) + \sum_ {j} \exp \left(s _ {j} ^ {-}\right)}\right)} _ {\mathcal {L} _ {i n} ^ {s u p}} \tag {7}
$$

It's easy to see that, differently from Eq. 4 and  $\mathcal{L}_{out}^{sup}$ , this condition is fulfilled when just one positive sample is more similar to the anchor than all negative samples. Similarly, another contrastive condition that should be avoided is:  $\sum_{j} s(f(x), f(x_j^-)) - \sum_{i} s(f(x), f(x_i^+)) < -\epsilon$  since one would need only one (or few) negative samples far away from the anchor in the representation space (i.e., orthogonal) to fulfil the condition.

# 3.1 FAILURE CASE OF INFONCE: THE ISSUE OF BIASES

Satisfying the  $\epsilon$ -condition (1) can generally guarantee good downstream performance, however, it does not take into account the presence of biases. A model could therefore take its decision based on certain visual features, i.e. the bias, that are correlated with the target downstream task but don't actually characterize it. This means that the same bias features would probably have a worse performance if transferred to a different dataset (e.g. different acquisition settings or image quality). Specifically, in contrastive learning, this can lead to settings where we are still able to minimize any InfoNCE-based loss (e.g. SupCon or  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE), but with degraded classification performance (Fig. 1b). To tackle this issue, in this work, we propose the FairKL regularization technique, a set of debiasing constraints that prevent the use of the bias features within the proposed metric learning approach. In order to give a more in-depth explanation of the  $\epsilon$ -InfoNCE failure case, we employ the notion of bias-aligned and bias-conflicting samples as in Nam et al. (2020). In our context, a bias-aligned sample shares the same bias attribute of the anchor, while a bias-conflicting sample does not. In this work, we assume that the bias attributes are either known a priori or that they can be estimated using a bias-capturing model, such as in Hong & Yang (2021).

Characterization of bias We denote bias-aligned samples with  $x^{,b}$  and bias-conflicting samples with  $x^{+,b'}$ . Given an anchor  $x$ , if the bias is "strong" and easy-to-learn, a positive bias-aligned sample  $x^{+,b}$  will probably be closer to the anchor  $x$  in the representation space than a positive bias-conflicting sample (of course, the same reasoning can be applied for the negative samples). This is why even in the case in which the  $\epsilon$ -condition is satisfied and the  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE is minimized, we could still be able to distinguish between bias-aligned and bias-conflicting samples. Hence, we say that there is a bias if we can identify an ordering on the learned representations, such as:

$$
\underbrace {d \left(f (x) , f \left(x _ {i} ^ {+, b}\right)\right)} _ {d _ {i} ^ {+, b}} <   \underbrace {d (f (x) , f \left(x _ {k} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}}\right)} _ {d _ {k} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}}} \leq \underbrace {d (f (x) , f \left(x _ {t} ^ {- , b}\right)} _ {d _ {t} ^ {-, b}} - \epsilon <   \underbrace {d (f (x) , f \left(x _ {j} ^ {- , b ^ {\prime}}\right)} _ {d _ {j} ^ {-, b ^ {\prime}}} - \epsilon \quad \forall i, k, t, j \tag {8}
$$

This represents the worst-case scenario, where the ordering is total (i.e.,  $\forall i, k, t, j$ ). Of course, there can also be cases in which the bias is not as strong, and the ordering may be partial.

FairKL regularization for debiasing Ideally, we would enforce the conditions  $d_k^{+,b'} - d_i^{+,b} = 0 \forall i,k$  and  $d_t^{-,b'} - d_j^{-,b} = 0 \forall t,j$ , meaning that every positive (resp. negative) bias-conflicting sample should have the same distance from the anchor as any other positive (resp. negative) bias-aligned sample. However, in practice, this condition is very strict, as it would enforce uniform distance among all positive (resp. negative) samples. A more relaxed condition would instead force the distributions of distances,  $\{d_k^{+,b'}\}$  and  $\{d_i^{+,b}\}$ , to be similar. Here, we propose two new debiasing constraints for both positive and negative samples using either the first moment (mean) of the distributions or the first two moments (mean and variance). Using only the average of the distributions, we obtain:

$$
\begin{array}{l} a) \frac {1}{P _ {a}} \sum_ {i} d _ {i} ^ {+, b} - \frac {1}{P _ {c}} \sum_ {k} d _ {k} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}} = 0 \Longleftrightarrow \frac {1}{P _ {c}} \sum_ {k} s _ {k} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}} - \frac {1}{P _ {a}} \sum_ {i} s _ {i} ^ {+, b} = 0 \\ b) \frac {1}{N _ {a}} \sum_ {j} d _ {j} ^ {-, b} - \frac {1}{N _ {c}} \sum_ {t} d _ {t} ^ {-, b ^ {\prime}} = 0 \Longleftrightarrow \frac {1}{N _ {c}} \sum_ {t} s _ {t} ^ {-, b ^ {\prime}} - \frac {1}{N _ {a}} \sum_ {j} s _ {j} ^ {-, b} = 0 \tag {9} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $P_{a}$  and  $P_{c}$  (resp.  $N_{a}$  and  $N_{c}$ ) are the number of positive (resp. negative) bias-aligned and bias-conflicting samples, respectively.

Calling the first moments  $\mu_{+,b} = \frac{1}{P_a}\sum_i d_i^{+,b},\mu_{+,b'} = \frac{1}{P_c}\sum_k d_k^{+,b'},\mu_{-,b} = \frac{1}{N_a}\sum_j d_j^{-,b},\mu_{-,b'} = \frac{1}{N_c}\sum_t d_t^{-,b'}$  and the second moments of the distance distributions  $\sigma_{+,b}^2 = \frac{1}{P_a - 1}\sum_i(d_i^{+,b} - \mu_{+,b})^2,$ $\sigma_{+,b'}^2 = \frac{1}{P_c - 1}\sum_k(d_k^{+,b'} - \mu_{+,b-})^2,\sigma_{-,b}^2 = \frac{1}{N_a - 1}\sum_j(d_j^{-,b} - \mu_{-,b})^2,\sigma_{-,b'}^2 = \frac{1}{N_c - 1}\sum_t(d_t^{-,b'} - \mu_{-,b'})^2,$  and making the hypothesis that the distance distributions follow a normal distribution, we can define a new set of debiasing constraints using the Kullback-Leibler divergence:

$$
\begin{array}{l} c) D _ {K L} \left(\left\{d _ {i} ^ {+, b} \right\} \mid \mid \left\{d _ {k} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}} \right\}\right) = \frac {1}{2} \left[ \frac {\sigma_ {+, b} ^ {2} + \left(\mu_ {+, b} - \mu_ {+, b ^ {\prime}}\right) ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {+, b ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}} - \log \frac {\sigma_ {+, b} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {+, b ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}} - 1 \right] = 0 \tag {9} \\ d) D _ {K L} (\{d _ {i} ^ {-, b} \} | | \{d _ {k} ^ {-, b ^ {\prime}} \}) = \frac {1}{2} \left[ \frac {\sigma_ {- , b} ^ {2} + (\mu_ {- , b} - \mu_ {- , b ^ {\prime}}) ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {- , b ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}} - \log \frac {\sigma_ {- , b} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {- , b ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}} - 1 \right] = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

In practice, one could also use their symmetric version  $(D_{KL}(p||q) + D_{KL}(q||p))$ , namely the Jeffreys divergence.

The proposed debiasing constraints can be easily added to any contrastive loss using the method of the Lagrange multipliers. They can thus be seen as a regularization term:  $\mathcal{R}^{FairKL} = \mathcal{R}^{pos} + \mathcal{R}^{neg}$ , where  $\mathcal{R}^{pos}$  is Eq.9-a or Eq.9-c and  $\mathcal{R}^{neg}$  is Eq.9-b or Eq.9-d. Here, we propose to minimize the following objective function, where  $\alpha$  and  $\lambda$  are positive hyperparameters::

$$
\mathcal {L} = \underbrace {- \alpha \sum_ {i} \log \left(\frac {\exp \left(s _ {i} ^ {+}\right)}{\exp \left(s _ {i} ^ {+} - \epsilon\right) + \sum_ {j} \exp \left(s _ {j} ^ {-}\right)}\right)} _ {\epsilon - S u p I n f o N C E} + \lambda \mathcal {R} ^ {F a i r K L} \tag {10}
$$

# 3.1.1 COMPARISON WITH OTHER DEBIASING METHODS

SupCon It is interesting to notice that the non-contrastive conditions in Eq. 5:  $s_t^+ - s_i^+ \leq 0 \quad \forall i, t \neq i$  are actually all fulfilled only when  $s_i^+ = s_t^+ \quad \forall i, t \neq i$ . This means that one tries to align all positive samples, regardless of their bias  $b$ , to a single point in the representation space. In other terms, at the optimal solution, one would also fulfill the following conditions:

$$
s _ {i} ^ {+, b} = s _ {t} ^ {+, b}, s _ {i} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}} = s _ {t} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}}, s _ {i} ^ {+, b} = s _ {t} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}}, s _ {i} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}} = s _ {t} ^ {+, b} \quad \forall i, t \neq i \tag {11}
$$

Realistically, this could lead to suboptimal solutions: we argue that the optimization process would mainly focus on the easier task, namely aligning bias-aligned samples, and neglecting the bias-conflicting ones. In highly biased settings, this could lead to worse performance than  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE. More empirical results supporting this hypothesis are presented in Appendix C.2.

End The constraints in Eq. 9-a and 9-b are very similar to what was recently proposed in Tartaglione et al. (2021) with EnD. However, EnD lacks the additional constraint on the standard deviation of the distances, which is given by 9-c and 9-d. An intuitive difference can be found in Fig. 1b: if we only consider the centroid of bias-aligned and bias-conflicting, the difference is already minimized. An analytical comparison can be found in Appendix A.3.

BiasCon In Hong & Yang (2021), authors propose a BiasCon loss, which is similar to SupCon but only aligns positive bias-conflicting samples. It looks for an encoder  $f$  that fulfills:

$$
s _ {j} ^ {-} - s _ {i} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}} \leq - \epsilon \quad \forall i, j \quad \text {a n d} \quad s _ {p} ^ {+, b} - s _ {i} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}} \leq 0 \quad \forall i, p \text {a n d} \quad s _ {t} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}} - s _ {i} ^ {+, b ^ {\prime}} \leq 0 \quad \forall i, t \neq i \tag {12}
$$

The problem here is that we try to separate the negative samples from only the positive bias-conflicting samples, ignoring the positive bias-aligned samples. This is probably why the authors proposed to combine this loss with a standard Cross Entropy.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we describe the experiments we perform to validate our proposed losses. We perform two sets of experiments. First, we benchmark our framework, presented in Sec. 3, on standard vision datasets such as: CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., a), CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky et al., b) and ImageNet-100 (Deng et al., 2009). Then, we analyze biased settings, employing BiasedMNIST (Bahng et al., 2020), Corrupted-CIFAR10 (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019), bFFHQ (Lee et al., 2021), 9-Class ImageNet (Ilyas et al., 2019) and ImageNet-A (Hendrycks et al., 2021).

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTS ON GENERIC VISION DATASETS

We conduct an empirical analysis of the  $\epsilon$ -SupCon and  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE losses on standard vision datasets to evaluate the different formulations and to assess the impact of the  $\epsilon$  parameter. We compare our results with baseline implementations including Cross Entropy (CE) and SupCon.

Experimental details We use the original setup from SupCon (Khosla et al., 2020), employing a ResNet-50, a large batch size (1024), a learning rate of 0.5, a temperature of 0.1, and multiview augmentation, for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Additional experimental details (including ImageNet $100^1$ ) and the different hyperparameters configurations are provided in Sec. B of the Appendix.

Results First, we compare our proposed  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE loss with the  $\epsilon$ -SupCon loss derived in Sec. 3. As reported in Tab. 1,  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE performs better than  $\epsilon$ -SupCon: we conjecture that the lack of the non-contrastive term of Eq. 5 leads to increased robustness, as it will also be shown in Sec. 4.2. For this reason, we focus on  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE. Further comparison with different values of  $\epsilon$  can be found in Sec. C.1, showing that  $SupCon \leq \epsilon$ -SupCon  $\leq \epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE in terms of accuracy. Results

on general computer vision datasets are presented in Tab. 2, in terms of top-1 accuracy. We report the performance for the best value of  $\epsilon$ ; the complete results can be found in Sec. C.1. The results are averaged across 3 independent trials for every configuration, and we also report the standard deviation. We obtain significant improvement with respect to all baselines and, most importantly, SupCon, on all benchmarks: on CIFAR-10 (+0.5%), on CIFAR-100 (+0.63%), and on ImageNet-100 (+1.31%).

# 4.2 EXPERIMENTS ON BIASED DATASETS

Next, we move on to analyzing how our proposed loss performs on biased learning settings. We employ five datasets, ranging from synthetic data to real facial images: Biased-MNIST, Corrupted-CIFAR10, bFFHQ, and 9-Class ImageNet along with ImageNet-A. The detailed setup and experimental details are provided in the supplementary material.

Figure 2: Comparison of  $\epsilon$ -SupCon and  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE on Biased-MNIST. It is noticeable that for  $\rho \leq 0.997$ ,  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE and  $\epsilon$ -SupCon are comparable, while for  $\rho = 0.999$  the gap is significantly larger: this could be due to the additional non-contrastive condition of SupCon.

Biased-MNIST is a biased version of the MNIST (Deng, 2012) dataset, as proposed in Bahng et al. (2020). A color bias is injected into the dataset, by colorizing the image background with ten predefined colors associated with the ten different digits. Given an image, the background is colored with the predefined color for that class with a probability  $\rho$ , and with any one of the other colors with a probability  $1 - \rho$ . Higher values of  $\rho$  will lead to more biased data. In this work, we explore the datasets in different values of  $\rho$ : 0.999, 0.997, 0.995 and 0.99. An unbiased test set is built with  $\rho = 0.1$ . We compare with cross entropy baseline and with other debiasing techniques, namely EnD (Tartaglione et al., 2021), LNL (Nam et al., 2020) and BiasCon (BC) and BiasBal (BB) (Hong & Yang, 2021).

Analysis of  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE and  $\epsilon$ -SupCon: First, we perform an evaluation of the  $\epsilon$ -SupCon and  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE losses alone, without our debiasing regularization term. Fig. 2 shows the accuracy on the unbiased test set, with the different values of  $\rho$ . Baseline results of a cross-entropy model (CE) are reported in Tab. 3. Both losses result in higher accuracy compared to the cross entropy. The generally higher robustness of contrastive-based formulations is also confirmed by the related literature (Khosla et al., 2020). Interestingly, in the most biased setting ( $\rho = 0.999$ ), we observe that  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE obtains higher accuracy than  $\epsilon$ -SupCon. Our conjecture is that the non-contrastive term of SupCon in Eq. 5 ( $s_t^+ - s_i^+ \leq 0$ $\forall i, t$ ) can lead, in highly biased settings, to more biased representations as the bias-aligned samples will be especially predominant among the positives. For this reason, we focus on  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE in the remaining of this work.

Debiasing with FairKL: Next, we apply our regularization technique FairKL jointly with  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE, and compare it with the other debiasing methods. The results are shown in Tab. 3. Our technique achieves the best results in all experiments, with high gaps in accuracy, especially in the most difficult settings (lower  $\rho$ ).

Corrupted CIFAR-10 is built from the CIFAR-10 dataset, by correlating each class with a certain texture (brightness, frost, etc.) following the protocol proposed in Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019). Similarly to Biased-MNIST, the dataset is provided with five different levels of ratio between bias-conflicting and bias-aligned samples. The results are shown in Tab. 4. Notably, we obtain the best

results in the most difficult scenario, when the amount of bias-conflicting samples is the lowest. Again, for the other settings, we obtain comparable results with the state of the art.

bFFHQ is proposed by Lee et al. (2021), and contains facial images. They construct the dataset in such a way that most of the females are young (age range 10-29), while most of the males are older (age range 40-59). The ratio between bias-conflicting and bias-aligned provided for this dataset is 0.5. The results are shown in Tab. 4, where our technique outperforms all other methods.

9-Class ImageNet and ImageNet-A We also test our method on the more complex and realistic 9-Class ImageNet (Ilyas et al., 2019) dataset. This dataset is a subset of ImageNet, which is known to contain textural biases (Geirhos et al., 2019). It aggregates 42 of the original classes into 9 macro categories. Following Hong & Yang (2021), we train a BagNet18 (Brendel & Bethge, 2019) as the bias-capturing model, which we then use to compute a bias score for the training samples, to apply within our regularization term. More details and the experimental setup can be found in the Sec. B.2.4. We evaluate the accuracy on the test set (biased) along with the unbiased accuracy (UNB), computed with the texture labels assigned in Brendel & Bethge (2019). We also report accuracy results on ImageNet-A (IN-A) dataset, which contains bias-conflicting samples (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Results are shown in Tab. 5. On the biased test set, the results are comparable with SoftCon, while on the harder sets unbiased and ImageNet-A we achieve SOTA results.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we proposed a metric-learning-based framework for supervised representation learning. We propose a new loss, called  $\epsilon$ -SupInfoNCE, that is based on the definition of the  $\epsilon$ -margin, which is the minimal margin between positive and negative samples. By adjusting this value, we are able to find a tighter approximation of the mutual information and achieve better results compared to standard Cross-Entropy and to the SupCon loss. Then, we tackle the problem of learning unbiased representations when the training data contains strong biases. This represents a failure case for InfoNCE-like losses. We propose FairKL, a debiasing regularization term, which is derived from our theoretical framework. With it, we enforce equality between the distribution of distances of bias-conflicting samples and bias-aligned samples. This, together with the increase of the  $\epsilon$  margin, allows us to reach state-of-the-art performances in the most extreme cases of biases in different datasets, comprising both synthetic data and real-world images.
