# ABSTRACT

Vector representations of words have heralded a transformational approach to classical problems in NLP; the most popular example is word2vec. However, a single vector does not suffice to model the polysemous nature of many (frequent) words, i.e., words with multiple meanings. In this paper, we propose a three-fold approach for unsupervised polysemy modeling: (a) context representations, (b) sense induction and disambiguation and (c) lexeme (as a word and sense pair) representations. A key feature of our work is the finding that a sentence containing a target word is well represented by a low rank subspace, instead of a point in a vector space. We then show that the subspaces associated with a particular sense of the target word tend to intersect over a line (one-dimensional subspace), which we use to disambiguate senses using a clustering algorithm that harnesses the Grassmannian geometry of the representations. The disambiguation algorithm, which we call  $K$ -Grassmeans, leads to a procedure to label the different senses of the target word in the corpus - yielding lexeme vector representations, all in an unsupervised manner starting from a large (Wikipedia) corpus in English. Apart from several prototypical target (word,sense) examples and a host of empirical studies to intuit and justify the various geometric representations, we validate our algorithms on standard sense induction and disambiguation datasets and present new state-of-the-art results.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Distributed representations are embeddings of words in a real vector space, achieved via an appropriate function that models the interaction between neighboring words in sentences (e.g.: neural networks (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012), log-bilinear models (Mnih & Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2013), co-occurrence statistics (Pennington et al., 2014; Levy & Goldberg, 2014)). Such an approach has been strikingly successful in capturing the (syntactic and semantic) similarity between words (and pairs of words), via simple linear algebraic relations between their corresponding vector representations. On the other hand, the polysemous nature of words, i.e., the phenomenon of the same surface form representing multiple senses, is a central feature of the creative process embodying natural languages. For example, a large, tall machine used for moving heavy objects and a tall, long-legged, long-necked bird both share the same surface form "crane". A vast majority of words, especially frequent ones, are polysemous, with each word taking on anywhere from two to a dozen different senses in many natural languages. For instance, WordNet collects 26,896 polysemous English words with an average of 4.77 senses each (Miller, 1995). Naturally, a single vector embedding does not appropriately represent a polysemous word.

There are currently two approaches to address the polysemy issue (a detailed discussion of the related work is in Appendix A): (a) sense specific representation learning (Chen et al., 2014; Rothe & Schütze, 2015), usually aided by hand-crafted lexical resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995); (b) unsupervised sense induction and sense/lexeme representation learning by inferring the senses directly from text (Huang et al., 2012; Neelakantan et al., 2015; Li & Jurafsky, 2015; Arora et al., 2016b).

Since hand-crafted lexical resources sometimes do not reflect the actual meaning of a target word in a given context (Véronis, 2004) and, more importantly, such resources are lacking in many languages

(and their creation draws upon intensive expert human resources), we focus on the second approach in this paper; such an approach is inherently scalable and potentially plausible with the right set of ideas. Indeed, a human expects the contexts to cue in on the particular sense of a specific word, and successful unsupervised sense representation and sense extraction algorithms would represent progress in the broader area of representation of natural language. Such are the goals of this work.

Firth's hypothesis – a word is characterized by the company it keeps (Firth, 1957) – has motivated the development of single embeddings for words, but also suggests that multiple senses for a target word could be inferred from its contexts (neighboring words within the sentence). This task is naturally broken into three related questions: (a) how to represent contexts (neighboring words of the target word); (b) how to induce word senses (partition instances of contexts into groups where the target word is used in the same sense within each group) and (c) how to represent lexemes (word and sense pairs) by vectors.

Existing works address these questions by exploring the latent structure of contexts. In an inspired work, Arora et al. (2016b) hypothesize that the global word representation is a linear combination of its sense representations, models the contexts by a finite number of discourse atoms, and recovers the sense representations via sparse coding of all the vectors of the vocabulary (a global fit). Other works perform a local context-specific sense induction: Li & Jurafsky (2015) introduce a sense-based language model to disambiguate word senses and to learn lexeme representations by incorporating the Chinese restaurant process, Reisinger & Mooney (2010) and Huang et al. (2012) label the word senses by clustering the contexts based on the average of the context word embeddings and learn lexeme representations using the labeled corpus. Neelakantan et al. (2015) retain the representation of contexts by the average of the word vectors, but improves the previous approach by jointly learning the lexeme vectors and the cluster centroids in one shot.

Grassmannian Model: We depart from the linear latent models in these prior works by presenting a nonlinear (Grassmannian) geometric property of contexts. We empirically observe and hypothesize that the context word representations surrounding a target word reside roughly in a low dimensional subspace. Under this hypothesis, a specific sense representation for a target word should reside in all the subspaces of the contexts where the word means this sense. Note that these subspaces need not cluster at all: a word such as "launch" in the sense of "beginning or initiating a new endeavor" could be used in a large variety of contexts. Nevertheless, our hypothesis that large semantic units (such as sentences) reside in low dimensional subspaces implies that the subspaces of all contexts where the target word shares the same meaning should intersect non-trivially. This further implies that there exists a direction (one dimensional subspace) that is very close to all subspaces and we treat such an intersection vector as the representation of a group of subspaces. Following this intuition, we propose a three-fold approach to deal with the three central questions posed above:

- Context Representation: we define the context for a target word to be a set of left  $W$  and right  $W$  non-functional words of the target word ( $W \approx 10$  in our experiments), including the target word itself, and represent it by a low-dimensional subspace spanned by its context word representations;  
- Sense Induction and Disambiguation: we induce word senses from their contexts by partitioning multiple context instances into groups, where the target word has the same sense within each group. Each group is associated with a representation – the intersection direction of the group – found via  $K$ -Grassmeans, a novel clustering method that harnesses the geometry of subspaces. Finally, we disambiguate word senses for new context instances using the respective group representations;  
- Lexeme Representation: the lexeme representations can be obtained by running an off-the-shelf word embedding algorithm on a labeled corpus. We label the corpus through hard decisions (involving erasure labels) and soft decisions (probabilistic labels), motivated by analogous successful approaches to decoding of turbo and low density parity check codes (LDPC) in wireless communication.

Experiments: The lexical aspect of our algorithm (i.e., senses can be induced and disambiguated individually for each word) as well as the novel geometry (subspace intersection vectors) jointly allow us to capture subtle shades of senses. For instance, in "Can you hear me? You're on the air. One of the great moments of live television, isn't it?", our representation is able to capture the occurrence of "air" to mean "live event on camera". In contrast, with a global fit such as that in

(Arora et al., 2016b) the senses are inherently limited in the number and type of "discourse atoms" that can be captured.

As a quantitative demonstration of the latent geometry captured by our methods, we evaluate the proposed induction algorithm on standard Word Sense Induction (WSI) tasks. Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art on two datasets: (a) SemEval-2010 Task 14 (Manandhar et al., 2010) whose word senses are obtained from OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006); and (b) a custom-built dataset built by repurposing the polysemous dataset of (Arora et al., 2016b). A detailed study of the experiments and quantitative results can be found in Section 5. In terms of lexeme vector embeddings, our representations have evaluations comparable to state-of-the-art on standard tasks – the word similarity task of SCWS (Huang et al., 2012) – and significantly better on a subset of the SCWS dataset which focuses on polysemous target words and the “police lineup” task of (Arora et al., 2016b). We present the detailed experiments and quantitative results in Appendix F.

# 2 CONTEXT REPRESENTATION

Contexts refer to entire sentences or (long enough) consecutive blocks of words in sentences surrounding a target word. Efficient distributed vector representations for sentences and paragraphs are active topics of research in the literature ((Le & Mikolov, 2014; Tai et al., 2015)), with much emphasis on appropriately relating the individual word embeddings with those of the sentences (and paragraphs) they reside in. The scenario of contexts studied here is similar in the sense that they constitute long semantic units similar to sentences, but different in that we are considering semantic units that all have a common target word residing inside them. Instead of a straightforward application of existing literature on sentence (and paragraph) vector embeddings to our setting, we deviate and propose a non-vector space representation; such a representation is central to the results of this paper and is best motivated by the following simple experiment.

![](images/a2ff9046918def4cbb389843165aee815e6fd6992f1c21a2423a7de5d33565b1.jpg)  
Figure 1: An experiment to study the low rank structure of context word embeddings. Histograms of the variance ratio are plotted for rank-  $N$  PCAs of the context embeddings.

Given a random word and a set of its contexts (culled from the set of all sentences where the target word appears), we use principle component analysis (PCA) to project the context word embeddings for every context into an  $N$ -dimensional subspace and measure the low dimensional nature of context word embeddings. We randomly sampled 500 words whose occurrence (frequency) is larger than 10,000, extracted their contexts from Wikipedia, and plotted the histogram of the variance ratios being captured by rank- $N$  PCA in Figure 1 for  $N = 3,4,5$ . We make the following observations: even rank-3 PCA captures at least  $45\%$  of the energy (i.e., variance ratio) of the context word representations and rank-4 PCA can capture at least half of the energy almost surely. As comparison, we note that the average the number of context words is roughly 21 and a rank-4 PCA over a random collection of 21 words would be expected to capture only  $20\%$  of the energy (this calculation is justified because word vectors have been observed to possess a spatial isotropy property (Arora et al., 2016a)). All word vectors were trained on the Wikipedia corpus with dimension  $d = 300$  using the skip

gram of word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013).

This experiment immediately suggests the low-dimensional nature of contexts, and that the contexts be represented in the space of subspaces, i.e., the Grassmannian manifold: we represent a context  $c$  (as a multiset of words) by a point in the Grassmannian manifold - a subspace (denoted by  $S(c)$ ) spanned by its top  $N$  principle components (denoted by  $\{u_n(c)\}_{n=1}^N$ ). A detailed algorithm chart for context representations is provided in Appendix J, for completeness.

# 3 SENSE INDUCTION AND DISAMBIGUATION

We now turn to sense induction, a basic task that explores polysemy: in this task, a set of sentences (each containing a common target word) have to be partitioned such that the target word is used in the same sense in all the sentences within each partition. The number of partitions relates to the

number of senses being identified for the target word. The geometry of the subset representations plays a key role in our algorithm and we start with this next.

Geometry of Polysemy Consider a target word  $w$  and a context sentence  $c$  containing this word  $w$ . The empirical experiment from the previous section allows us to represent  $c$  by a  $N$ -dimensional subspace of the vectors of the words in  $c$ . Since  $N$  ( $3 \sim 5$  in our experiments) is much smaller than the number of words in  $c$  (21, on average), one suspects that the representation associated with  $c$  wouldn't change very much if the target word  $w$  were expurgated from it, i.e.,  $S(c) \approx S(c \setminus w)$ . On the other hand  $v(w)$  (the vector representation of the target word  $w$ ) perhaps has a fairly large intersection with  $S(c)$  and thus also with  $S(c \setminus w)$ . Putting these two observations together, one arrives at the following hypothesis, in the context of monosemous target words:

Intersection Hypothesis: the target word vector  $v(w)$  should reside in the intersection of  $S(c \setminus w)$ , where the intersection is over all its contexts  $c$ .

![](images/268540adebff74d76fa5297dab9bf4c030dd3a3e8a49816c8629484b3a9839ca.jpg)  
Figure 2: The geometry of contexts for monosemy.

The reason why this hypothesis is made in the context of monosemous words is that in this case the word vector representation is "pure", while polysemous words are different words with the same (lexical) surface form. An empirical validation of the intersection hypothesis is provided in Appendix B.

Visualization of Intersection Hypothesis: A visual representation of this geometric phenomenon is in Figure 2, where we have projected the  $d$ -dimensional word representations into 3-dimensional vectors and use these 3-dimensional word vectors to get the subspaces for the four contexts (we set  $N = 2$  for visualization) in Appendix I of the target word "typhoon", and plot the subspaces as 2-dimensional planes. From Figure 2, we can see that all the context subspaces roughly intersect at a common direction, thus empirically justifying the intersection hypothesis.

Recovering the Intersection Direction: An algorithmic approach to robustly discover the intersection direction involves finding

that direction vector that is "closest" to all subspaces; we propose doing so by solving the following optimization problem:

$$
\hat {u} (w) = \arg \min  _ {\| u \| = 1} \sum_ {w \in c} d (u, S (c \backslash w)) ^ {2}, \quad d (u, S) = \sqrt {\| u \| ^ {2} - \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \left(u ^ {\mathrm {T}} u _ {n}\right) ^ {2}}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $d(v, S)$  is the shortest  $\ell_2$ -distance between  $u$  and subspace  $S$ , and  $u_1, \ldots, u_N$  are  $N$  orthonormal basis vectors for subspace  $S$ . Thus (1) is equivalent to,

$$
\hat {u} (w) = \arg \max  _ {\| u \| = 1} \sum_ {w \in c} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \left(u ^ {\mathrm {T}} u _ {n} (c \backslash w)\right) ^ {2}, \tag {2}
$$

which can be solved by taking the first principle component of  $\{u_n(c\setminus w)\}_{w\in c,n = 1,\dots ,N}$

The property that context subspaces of a monoseamous word intersect at one direction naturally generalizes to polysemy:

Polysemy Intersection Hypothesis: the context subspaces of a polysemous word intersect at different directions for different senses.

This intuition is validated by the following experiment, which continues on the same theme as the one done for the monosemous word "typhoon". Now we study the geometry of contexts for a polysemous word "crane", which can either mean a large, tall machine used for moving heavy objects or a tall, long-legged, long-necked bird. We list four contexts for each sense of "crane" in Appendix I, repeat the experiment as conducted above for the monosemous word "typhoon" and visualize the context subspaces for two senses in Figure 3(a) and 3(b) respectively. Figure 3(c) plots the direction of two intersections. This immediately suggests that the contexts where "crane" stands for a bird intersect at one direction and the contexts where "crane" stands for a machine, intersect at a different direction as visualized in 3 dimensions.

(c) intersection

Sense Induction We can use the representation of senses by the intersection directions of context subspaces for unsupervised sense induction: supposing the target polysemous word that has  $K$  senses (known ahead of time for now), the goal is to partition the contexts associated with this target word into  $K$  groups within each of which the target polysemous word shares the same sense. The fact that two groups of context subspaces, corresponding to different senses, intersect at different directions motivates our geometric algorithm: we note that each one of the contexts belongs to a group associated by the nearest intersection direction which serves as a prototype of the group. Part of the task is also to identify the most appropriate intersection direction vectors associated with each group. This task represents a form of unsupervised clustering which can be formalized as the optimization problem below.

Given a target polysemous word  $w$ ,  $M$  contexts  $c_{1},\ldots ,c_{M}$  containing  $w$  and a number  $K$  indicating the number of senses  $w$  has, we would like to partition the  $M$  contexts into  $K$  sets  $S_{1},\dots,S_{K}$  so as to minimize the distance  $d(\cdot ,\cdot)$  of each subspace to the intersection direction of its group,

$$
L = \min  _ {u _ {1}, \dots , u _ {K}, S _ {1}, \dots , S _ {K}} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \sum_ {c \in S _ {k}} d ^ {2} \left(u _ {k}, S (c \backslash w)\right). \tag {3}
$$

This problem (3) is analogous to the objective of  $K$ -means clustering for vectors and solving it exactly in the worst case can be shown to be NP-hard. We propose a natural algorithm by repurposing traditional  $K$ -means clustering built for vector spaces to the Grassmannian space; the full details are provided in Appendix K.

Note that our algorithm can be run for any one specific target word, and makes for efficient online sense induction; this is relevant in information retrieval applications where the sense of the query words may need to be found in real time. To get a qualitative feel for how good  $K$ -Grassmeans is for the sense induction task, we run the following synthetic experiment: we randomly pick  $K$  monosemous words, merge their surface forms to create a single artificial polesemous word, collect all the contexts corresponding to the  $K$  monosemous words, replace every occurrence of the  $K$  monosemous words by the single artificial polysemous word. Then we run the  $K$ -Grassmeans algorithm on these contexts with the artificial polysemous word as the target word, so as to recover their original labels (which are known ahead of time, since we merged known monosemous words together to create the artificial polysemous word). Figure 4(a) shows the clustering performances on a realization of the artificial polysemous word made of "monastery" and "phd" (here  $K = 2$ ) and Figure 4(b))shows the clustering performance when  $K = 5$  monosemous words "employers", "exiled", "grossed", "incredible" and "unreleased" are merged together. We repeat the experiment over 1,00 trials with  $K$  varying from  $2\sim 8$  and the accuracy of sense induction is reported in Figure 4(c). Compared to the baseline algorithm proposed in (Huang et al., 2012; Neelakantan et al., 2015),  $K$ -Grassmean on subspaces outperforms  $K$ -means on average word vectors by  $5 - 6\%$ . We also provide a qualitative study of this algorithm on real data in Appendix C, where we study the semantics of each group for an example target word "columbia". From these experiments we see that  $K$ -Grassmeans performs very well, qualitatively and quantitatively.

(c) accuracy

A quantitative experiment on large and standardized real datasets (which involves real polysemous target words as opposed to synthetic ones), with a comparison with other algorithms in the literature, is detailed in Section 5, where we see that  $K$ -Grassmeans outperforms state-of-the-art.

Sense Disambiguation Having the intersection directions to represent the senses, we are ready to disambiguate a target word sense in a given context using the learned intersection directions specific to this target word: for a new context instance for a polysemous word, the goal is to identify which sense this word means in the context. Our approach is three-fold: represent the context by a low dimensional subspace  $S(c \setminus w)$  approximation of the linear span of the word embeddings of non-functional words in the context, find the orthogonal projection distance between the intersection vector  $u_{k}(w)$  and the context subspace, and finally output  $k^{*}$  that minimizes the distance, i.e.,

$$
k ^ {*} = \arg \min  _ {k} d \left(u _ {k} (w), S (c \backslash w)\right). \tag {4}
$$

We refer to (4) as a hard decoding of word senses since this outputs a deterministic label. At times, it makes sense to consider a soft decoding algorithm where the output is a probability distribution. The probability that  $w$  takes  $k$ -th sense given the context  $c$  is defined via,

$$
P (w, c, k) = \frac {\exp (- d \left(u _ {k} (w) , S (c \backslash w)\right))}{\sum_ {k ^ {\prime}} \exp (- d \left(u _ {k ^ {\prime}} (w) , S (c \backslash w)\right))}. \tag {5}
$$

Here we calculate the probability as a monotonic function of the cosine distance between the intersection vector  $u_{k}(w)$  and the context subspace  $S(c\setminus w)$ , inspired by similar heuristics in the literature (Huang et al., 2012). A qualitative study of (4) and (5) is again provided in Appendix C, where we apply (4) and (5) on the target word "columbia" and five sentences as its contexts.

# 4 LEXEMEREPRESENTATION

Induction and disambiguation are important tasks by themselves, but several downstream applications can use a distributed vector representation of the multiple senses associated with a target word. Just as with word representations, we expect the distributed lexeme representations to have semantic meanings - similar lexemes should be represented by similar vectors.

It seems natural to represent a lexeme  $s_k(w)$  of a given word  $w$  by the intersection vector associated with the  $k$ -th sense group of  $w$ , i.e.,  $u_k(w)$ . Such an idea is supported by an observation that the intersection vector is close to the word representation vector for many monosemous words (a detailed study of this observation is provided in Appendix D). Despite this empirical evidence, somewhat surprisingly, lexeme representation using the intersection vectors turns out to be not such a good idea, and the reason is fairly subtle. It turns out that the intersection vectors are concentrated on a relatively small surface area on the sphere (magnitudes are not available in the intersection vectors) – the cosine similarity between two random intersection vectors among 10,000 intersection vectors (five intersection vectors each for 2,000 polysemous words) is 0.889 on average with standard deviation 0.068. This is quite in contrast to analogous statistics for (global) word embeddings from the word2vec algorithm: the cosine similarity between two random word vectors is 0.134 on average

with standard deviation 0.072. Indeed, word vector representations are known to be approximately uniformly scattered on the unit sphere (the so-called isotropy property, see (Arora et al., 2016a)). The intersection vectors cluster together far more and are quite far from being isotropic – yet they are still able to distinguish different senses as shown by the empirical studies and qualitative experiments on prototypical examples above (and also on standard datasets, as seen in Appendix F).

Due to this geometric mismatch between word vectors and intersection directions, and corresponding mismatch in linear algebraic properties expected of these distributed representations, it is not appropriate to use the intersection direction as the lexeme vector representation. In this light, we propose to learn the lexeme representations by an alternate (and more direct) procedure: first label the polysemous words in the corpus using the proposed disambiguation algorithm from Section 3 and then run a standard word embedding algorithm (we use word2vec) on this labeled corpus, yielding lexeme embeddings. There are several possibilities regarding labeling and are discussed next.

Hard Decodings We label the corpus using the disambiguation algorithm as in (4). A special label "IDK" representing "I don't know" is introduced to avoid introducing too many errors during the labeling phase since (a) our approach is based on the bag-of-words model and cannot guarantee to label every sense correctly; (for example, "arm" in "the boat commander was also not allowed to resume his career in the Greek Navy due to his missing arm which was deemed a factor that could possibly raise enquiries regarding the mission which caused the trauma." will be labeled as "weapon"); and (b) we are not clear how such errors will affect existing word embedding algorithms.

An "IDK" label is introduced via checking the closest distance between the context subspace and the intersection directions, i.e., let  $u_{k^*}(w)$  be the closest intersection vector of  $w$  to context  $c$ , we will label this instance as  $k^*$  if  $d(u_{k^*}(w), S(c \setminus w)) < \theta$  and "IDK" otherwise, where  $\theta$  is a hyperparameter. A detailed algorithm chart for sense disambiguation and corpus labeling is provided in Appendix L. The "IDK" label includes instances of words that means a rare sense, (for example: "crane" as in stretching the neck), or a confusing sense which requires disambiguation of context words (for example: "book" and "ticket" in "book a flight ticket"). The IDK labeling procedure is inspired by analogous scenarios in reliable communication over noisy channels where the log likelihood ratio of (coded) bits is close to zero and in practice are better labeled as "erasures", than treating them as informative for the overall decoding task (Cidon et al., 2012).

Soft Decodings Another way of labeling is via using the absolute scores of  $K$ -Grassmeans disambiguation for each sense of a target work in a specific context, cf. Equation (5). Soft decoding involves generating a random corpus by sampling one sense for every occurrence of a polysemous word according to its probability distribution from (5). Then lexeme representations are obtained via an application of a standard word embedding algorithm (we use word2vec) on this (random) labeled corpus. Since we only consider words that are frequent enough (i.e., whose occurrence is larger than 10,000), each sense of a polysemous word is sampled enough times to allow a robust lexeme representation with high probability.

Soft decoding benefits in two scenarios: (a) when a context has enough information for disambiguation (i.e., the probability distribution (5) concentrates on one), the random sampling will have a high chance making a correct decision. (b) when a context is ambiguous (i.e., the probability distribution have more than one peak), the random sampling will have a chance of not making a wrong (irreversible) decision.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

Throughout this paper we have conducted multiple qualitative and empirical experiments to highlight and motivate the various geometric representations. In this section we evaluate our algorithms on sense disambiguation method empirically on (standardized) datasets from the literature, allowing us to get a quantitative feel for the performance on large datasets, as well as afford a comparison with other algorithms. We also evaluate our algorithms on lexeme representations in Appendix F.

Preliminaries All our algorithms are unsupervised and operate on a large corpus obtained from Wikipedia dated 09/15. We use WikiExtractor (http://medialab.di.unipi.it/wiki/Wikipedia_Extractor) to extract the plain text. We use the skip-gram model from word2vec

(Mikolov et al., 2010) as the word embedding algorithm where we use the default parameter setting. We set  $c = 10$  as the context window size and set  $N = 3$  as the rank of PCA. We choose  $K = 2$  and  $K = 5$  in our experiment. For the disambiguation algorithm, we set  $\theta = 0.6$ .

Baselines Our main comparisons are with algorithms that conduct unsupervised polysemy disambiguation, specifically the sense clustering method of (Huang et al., 2012), the multi-sense skip gram model (MSSG) of (Neelakantan et al., 2015) with different parameters, and the sparse coding method with a global dictionary of (Arora et al., 2016b). We were able to download the word and sense representations for (Huang et al., 2012; Neelakantan et al., 2015) online, and trained the word and sense representations of (Arora et al., 2016b) on the same corpus as that used by our algorithms.

Sense Induction and Disambiguation Word sense induction (WSI) tasks conduct the following test: given a set of context instances containing a target word, one is asked to partition the context instances into groups such that within each group the target word shares the same sense. We test our induction algorithm,  $K$ -Grassmeans, on two datasets - a standard one from SemEval-2010 (Manandhar et al., 2010) and a custom-built Make-Sense-2016. Appendix E gives a detailed description about the two datasets.

We evaluate the performance of the algorithms on this (disambiguation) task according to standard measures in the literature: V-Measure and paired F-Score; these two evaluation metrics also feature in the SemEval-2010 WSI task (Manandhar et al., 2010). V-measure is an entropy-based external cluster evaluation metric. Paired F-score evaluates clustering performance by converting the clustering problem into a binary classification problem - given two instances, do they belong to the same cluster or not? Both metrics operate on a contingency table  $A = \{a_{tk}\}$ , where  $a_{tk}$  is the number of instances that are manually labeled as  $t$  and algorithmically labeled as  $k$ . A detailed description is given in Appendix M for completeness. Both the metrics range from 0 to 1, and perfect clustering gives a score of 1. Empirical statistics show that V-Measure favors those with a larger number of cluster and paired F-score favors those with a smaller number of cluster.

Table 1 shows the detailed results of our experiments, and from where we see that  $K$ -Grassmeans strongly outperforms the others. The main reason behind the better performance seems to be that  $K$ -Grassmeans disambiguates some subtle senses where the others cannot. For example, following are three sentences containing "air": (a) Can you hear me? You're on the air. One of the great moments of live television, isn't it? (b) A government report says the improvements are the result of changes in air traffic controls, and a dropoff in passengers. (c) The empty shells piled here along the roadside fill the air with their briny aroma. It can be observed that enough information is contained in the sentence to inform us that the first "air" is about broadcasting, the second is about the region above the ground and the third one is about a mixture of gases.  $K$ -Grassmeans can distinguish all three while the other algorithms cannot.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we study the geometry of contexts and polysemy and propose a three-fold approach (entitled  $K$ -Grassmeans) to model target polysemous words in an unsupervised fashion: (a) we represent a context (non-function words surrounding the target word) by a low rank subspace, (b)

induce word senses by clustering the subspaces in terms of a distance to an intersection vector and (c) representing lexemes (as a word and sense pair) by labeling the corpus. Our representations are novel and involve nonlinear (Grassmannian) geometry of subspaces and the clustering algorithms are designed to harness this specific geometry. The overall performance of the method is evaluated quantitatively on standardized word sense induction and word similarity tasks and we present new state-of-the-art results. Several new avenues of research in natural language representations arise from the ideas in this work and we discuss a few items in Appendix H.
