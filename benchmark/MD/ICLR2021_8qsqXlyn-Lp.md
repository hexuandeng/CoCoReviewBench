# ABSTRACT

Low-dimensional embedding techniques such as tSNE and UMAP allow visualizing high-dimensional data and therewith facilitate the discovery of interesting structure. Although they are widely used, they visualize data as is, rather than in light of the background knowledge we have about the data. What we already know, however, strongly determines what is novel and hence interesting. In this paper we propose two methods for factoring out prior knowledge in the form of distance matrices from low-dimensional embeddings. To factor out prior knowledge from tSNE embeddings, we propose JEDI that adapts the tSNE objective in a principled way using Jensen-Shannon divergence. To factor out prior knowledge from any downstream embedding approach, we propose CONFETTI, in which we directly operate on the input distance matrices. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world data show that both methods work well, providing embeddings that exhibit meaningful structure that would otherwise remain hidden.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Embedding high dimensional data into low dimensional spaces, such as with tSNE (van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) or UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018), allow us to visually inspect and discover meaningful structure from the data that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to see. These methods are as popular as they are useful, but, at the same time limited in that they are one-shot only: they embed the data as is, and that is that. If the resulting embedding reveals novel knowledge, all is well, but, what if the structure that dominates it is something we already know, something we are no longer interested in, or, if we want to discover whether the data has meaningful structure other than what the first result revealed? In word embeddings, for example, we may already know that certain words are synonyms, while in single cell sequencing we may want to discover structure other than known cell types, or factor out family relationships. The question at hand is therefore, how can we obtain low-dimensional embeddings that reveal structure beyond what we already know, i.e. how to factor out prior knowledge from low-dimensional embeddings?

For conditional embeddings, research so far mostly focused on emphasizing rather than factoring out prior knowledge (De Ridder et al., 2003; Hanhijärvi et al., 2009; Barshan et al., 2011), with conditional tSNE as notable exception, which, however, can only factor out label information (Kang et al., 2019). Here, we propose two techniques for factoring out a more general form of prior knowledge from low-dimensional embeddings of arbitrary data types. In particular, we consider background knowledge in the form of pairwise distances between samples. This formulation allows us to cover a plethora of practical instances including labels, clustering structure, family trees, user-defined distances, but also, and especially important for unstructured data, kernel matrices.

To factor out prior knowledge from tSNE embeddings, we propose JEDI, in which we adapt the tSNE objective in a principled way using Jensen-Shannon divergence. It has an intuitively appealing information theoretic interpretation, and maintains all the strengths and weaknesses of tSNE. One of these is runtime, which is why UMAP is particularly popular in bioinformatics. To factor out prior knowledge from embedding approaches in general, including UMAP, we hence propose CONFETTI, which directly operates on the input data. An extensive set of experiments shows that both methods work well in practice and provide embeddings that reveal meaningful structure beyond provided background knowledge, such as organizing flower images according to shape rather than color, or organizing single cell gene expression data beyond cell type, revealing batch effects and tissue type.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Embedding high dimensional data into a low dimensional space is a research topic of perennial interest that includes classic methods such as principal component analysis Pearson (1901), multidimensional scaling (Torgerson, 1952), self organizing maps (Kohonen, 1982), and isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), all of which focus on keeping large distances intact. This is inadequate for data that lies on a manifold that resembles a Euclidean space only locally, which is the case for high dimensional data (Silva & Tenenbaum, 2003) and for which we hence need methods such as locally linear embedding (LLE) (Roweis & Saul, 2000) and stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE) (Hinton & Roweis, 2003) that focus on keeping local distances intact. The current state of the art methods are t-distributed SNE (tSNE) by van der Maaten & Hinton (2008) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP) by McInnes et al. (2018). Both are by now staple methods for data processing, e.g. in biology (Becht et al., 2019; Kobak & Berens, 2019) and NLP (Coenen et al., 2019). As they often yield highly similar embeddings (Kobak & Linderman, 2019) it is a matter of taste which one to use. While tSNE has an intuitive interpretation, despite recent optimizations (van der Maaten, 2014; Linderman et al., 2019) compared to UMAP it suffers from very long runtimes.

Whereas the above consider only the data, there also exist proposals that additionally take user input and/or domain knowledge into account. Supervised LLE (De Ridder et al., 2003), guided LLE (Alipanahi & Ghodsi, 2011), and supervised PCA (Barshan et al., 2011) all aim to emphasize rather than factor out the structure given as prior knowledge. Like us, Kang et al. (2016; 2019); Puolamaki et al. (2018) all do factor out background knowledge, but are much more limited in the type of prior knowledge. In particular, Puolamaki et al. (2018) requires users to specify clusters in the embedded space, Kang et al. (2016) requires background knowledge for which a maximum entropy distribution can be obtained, while Kang et al. (2019) extend tSNE and propose conditional tSNE (ctSNE) which accepts prior knowledge in the form of class labels. In contract, we consider prior knowledge in the form of arbitrary distance metrics, and propose both, an information theoretic extension to tSNE, and an embedding-algorithm independent approach to factor out prior knowledge.

# 3 THEORY

We present two approaches, with distinct properties, that both solve the problem of embedding high dimensional data while factoring out prior knowledge. We start with an informal definition of the problem, after which we introduce vanilla tSNE. We then present our first solution, JEDI, which extends the tSNE objective to incorporate prior information. We then present CONFETTI, which uses an elegant yet powerful idea that allows us to directly factor out prior knowledge from the distance matrix of the high dimensional data, which allows CONFETTI to be used in combination with any embedding algorithm that operates on distance matrices.

# 3.1 THE PROBLEM - INFORMALLY

Given a set of  $n$  samples  $X$  from a high dimensional space, e.g.  $\mathbb{R}^d$ , our goal is to find a low dimensional representation  $Y$  in  $\mathbb{R}^2$  that captures the local structure in  $X$  while factoring out prior knowledge  $Z$  about the samples. Here, we consider both high dimensional data  $X$  and prior  $Z$  to be given as distance matrices, thus allowing for data from typical spaces such as Euclidean, but also images, up to unstructured data such as texts or graphs, for which distance matrices can be specified using a kernel. When embedding  $X$ , our goal is to embed the samples such that the pairwise low dimensional distances  $D^{Y}$  resemble high dimensional distances  $D^{X}$  locally, but are distinct to the prior distances  $D^{Z}$ . Informally, we can state this goal as finding an embedding  $Y$  subject to

$$
D ^ {X} \approx D ^ {Y} \not \approx D ^ {Z}.
$$

We could formally define this as a multi-objective problem composed of a minimization over the difference between  $D^{X}$  and  $D^{Y}$  and a maximization of the difference between  $D^{Y}$  and  $D^{Z}$ . Besides how to measure these differences, there are two problems that render classic multi-objective optimization impractical. First, the two functions are highly imbalanced, with the minimization objective obtaining its optimum at 0 and the maximization at  $+\infty$ , hence we need to constrain the optimization. Second, we want to put emphasis on correctly reconstructing local structure, as this yields superior visualizations (van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008; McInnes et al., 2018).

# 3.2 THE PROBLEM - INFORMATION THEORETICALLY

The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) (van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) is a state-of-the-art approach for embedding data into low dimensional spaces that preserves the local structure of the high dimensional data. In particular, it models the local neighborhood of a point by casting the pairwise distances into similarity distributions that express for each point  $i$  the likelihood of observing point  $j$  as neighbor, given by  $p_{j|i}$ . For the high dimensional distances  $D_{ij}^{X}$ , this likelihood is approximated by a Gaussian kernel centered at point  $i$

$$
p _ {j | i} = \frac {\exp (- (D _ {i j} ^ {X}) ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {i} ^ {2})}{\sum_ {k \neq i} \exp (- (D _ {i k} ^ {X}) ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {i} ^ {2})}.
$$

To account for varying densities of points in the space, the variance  $\sigma_{i}$  is dependent on where the kernel is centered. Given the user specified parameter perplexity, which can be thought of as an estimate of the neighborhood size, we can solve perplexity  $= 2^{H(P_i)}$  for  $\sigma_{i}$  for each point  $i$ , where  $H(P_{i}) = \sum_{j}p_{j|i}\log p_{j|i}$  is the entropy. By symmetrizing the conditional probabilities, the joint probability of a pair of points is given as  $p_{ij} = \frac{p_{j|i} + p_{i|j}}{2n}$ , which yields the desired local similarity representation of high dimensional points.

The low dimensional point similarities  $q_{ij}$  are represented by a t-distribution instead of a Gaussian, which solves the crowding problem<sup>1</sup> due to its heavy tails. We thus get low dimensional similarities

$$
q _ {i j} = \frac {\left(1 + \left(D _ {i j} ^ {Y}\right) ^ {2}\right) ^ {- 1}}{\sum_ {k \neq l} \left(1 + \left(D _ {k l} ^ {Y}\right) ^ {2}\right) ^ {- 1}}.
$$

The goal of tSNE is to model pairs of points exhibiting a high similarity in the high dimensional space to have a high similarity in the low dimensional space. This is achieved by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL), given by  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P\parallel Q) = \sum_{i\neq j}p_{ij}\log \frac{p_{ij}}{q_{ij}}$ , for the pairwise probabilities. This information theoretic measure yields the number of excess bits needed if we would encode  $P$  using a code optimal for encoding  $Q$  and thus models how well  $Q$  approximates  $P$ . Minimizing the KL divergence with respect to  $Y$ , we get a non-convex objective that we can practically optimize using gradient descent. Using a similar notion of neighborhood distributions, we can now define a new objective that instantiates our objective using tools from information theory.

# 3.2.1 FACTORING OUT PRIOR INFORMATION WITH JEDI

To incorporate prior information into the tSNE objective, we first need to model the neighborhood distribution  $P'$  of the prior. Similar to the high dimensional data, we use a Gaussian kernel by which we hence put emphasis on samples that are close according to the prior, defined as

$$
p _ {j | i} ^ {\prime} = \frac {\exp (- (D _ {i j} ^ {Z}) ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {i} ^ {2})}{\sum_ {k \neq i} \exp (- (D _ {i k} ^ {Z}) ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {i} ^ {2})},
$$

with  $\sigma_{i}$  a perplexity parameter which describes the desired neighborhood size in the prior space.

We thus search for a similarity distribution  $Q$  of points  $Y$  in the low dimensional space, that is similar to the high dimensional similarities  $P$  but different from the prior similarities  $P'$ . Similar to tSNE, the first term of our objective corresponds to minimizing the KL divergence, thus a natural extension would be to add a second term that rewards maximizing the KL divergence between the distances of embedding  $Q$  and prior  $P'$ . This would be naive, however, as this second term would dominate the optimization because KL divergence is unbounded. Furthermore, it would not allow us to exploit the asymmetry of divergence in the one or the other direction.

To mitigate the unboundedness, the skewed KL divergence has been proposed, mixing the two distributions  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}^{\beta}(P||Q) = D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P||(1 - \beta)P + \beta Q)$  with  $\beta \in [0,1]$  controlling skewness and thus boundedness (see e.g. Yamano (2019)). To obtain symmetry, the  $\beta$ -Jensen-Shannon divergence defined as  $\mathrm{JS}_{\beta}(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2} (D_{\mathrm{KL}}^{\beta}(P||Q) + D_{\mathrm{KL}}^{\beta}(Q||P))$  was introduced. Based on these ideas, we propose a new divergence, which we call parameterized Jensen-Shannon Divergence (pJSD),

which allows to control for both, the level of skewness as well as the level of symmetry, and prove that pJSD is bounded.

Definition 1 (Parameterized Jensen Shannon Divergence). For two probability distributions  $P'$  and  $Q$  we define the parameterized Jensen-Shannon divergence as

$$
\mathrm {J S} _ {\beta} ^ {\alpha} (P ^ {\prime} | | Q) = \alpha D _ {\mathrm {K L}} (P ^ {\prime} | | \beta Q + (1 - \beta) P ^ {\prime}) + (1 - \alpha) D _ {\mathrm {K L}} (Q | | P ^ {\prime} + (1 - \beta) Q),
$$

where  $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$  determines the level of symmetry and  $0 < \beta < 1$  determines the level of skewness.

Theorem 1 (Upper bound on pJSD). For  $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$  and  $0 < \beta < 1$  the parametrized JS divergence is bounded from above by

$$
\mathrm {J S} _ {\beta} ^ {\alpha} \leq - \log (1 - \beta).
$$

We provide a proof in App. A.1.2. Putting the pieces together, we can now formulate our objective as the minimization of the KL divergence between the similarity distributions of  $X$  and  $Y$ , and the maximization of the pJSD between the similarity distributions of  $Y$  and  $Z$ , which is

$$
\underset {Y} {\arg \min } D _ {\mathrm {K L}} (P | | Q) - \operatorname {J S} _ {\beta} ^ {\alpha} (P ^ {\prime} | | Q).
$$

While the parameters  $\alpha, \beta$  give the user flexibility on how much of the prior distribution should be factored out, we will later discuss a good default parameter instantiation based on synthetic data. This objective, as with the original tSNE objective, can be optimized using gradient descent. We provide the derivation of the gradients in App. A.1.1. This provides us with a method that solves our problem of factoring out prior knowledge on information theoretic grounds, which we call JEDI in resemblance of the Jensen Shannon Divergence.

Computational Complexity The computational and memory complexity of JEDI is in  $O(kn^2)$ , for  $n$  samples and  $k$  iterations, which comes from the summation over all pairs of sample in the divergences in each iteration. Due to the interactions in the gradient of pJSD, standard algorithmic optimizations of tSNE (van der Maaten, 2014; Linderman et al., 2019) are not directly applicable.

Overall, JEDI is a powerful, theoretically appealing approach to factor out prior knowledge. Based on tSNE, JEDI inherits many of its strengths and weaknesses. In particular runtime and strong emphasis on local structure make it hard to successfully apply tSNE, and therewith JEDI, to datasets that are either very large and/or contain structure at different scales, i.e. data as typically considered in bioinformatics. In the next section, we therefore revisit the problem, and propose an embedding algorithm independent approach that is applicable to such settings.

# 3.3 THE PROBLEM - ALGORITHM INDEPENDENTLY

UMAP is one of the state-of-the-art competitors to tSNE that alleviates its drawbacks for large data that not only contain local structure. Rather than presenting a dedicated solution for UMAP, we here propose a general, embedding-formulation independent approach. To do so, we have to revisit the original problem formulation, where the goal is to approximate high dimensional distances with embedding distances while simultaneously keeping them far from the prior. The key idea here is that, if we factor out the prior knowledge from the high dimensional distances directly, we are independent of the actual embedding process, and hence any embedding algorithm can be used. Informally, we can state this as  $(D^{X} \ominus D^{Z}) \approx D^{Y}$ , where  $\ominus$  describes some yet to be defined way of factoring out prior knowledge  $Z$  from the distances over high dimensional data  $X$ . Once we have this operator, we can use any distance metric based embedding algorithm on its result to obtain high quality embeddings  $Y$  from which  $Z$  has been factored out. Clearly, the operator should result in a proper distance metric, discard any structure that is evident and keep any structure that is not evident given prior knowledge  $Z$ . W.l.o.g., for the remainder of this section we assume that the distances  $D$  are scaled to  $D' = \frac{1}{D_{max}} D$ , with  $D_{max}$  the maximum value in  $D$ . We define operator  $\ominus$  as

$$
(D ^ {X} \ominus_ {\lambda} D ^ {Z}) _ {i j} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} D _ {i j} ^ {X} - \frac {1}{2} \lambda D _ {i j} ^ {Z} + \lambda & i \neq j  , \\ D _ {i j} ^ {X} & i = j  , \end{array} \right.
$$

which is to say, we subtract the information given by the prior distances from the high dimensional distances in a linear form, with  $\lambda$  controlling how much prior to be removed. Although surprisingly

simple, this elegant definition has very convenient properties that render it very powerful. First, there is only a single parameter  $\lambda$ , which due to linearity gives the user direct and interpretable control over how much the prior information should be taken into account. Second, the distance matrix we obtain by applying the operator maintains metric properties – the proof can be found in App. A.1.3 – that are desired (or even required) by downstream algorithms.

Theorem 2 (Metric). Assuming that  $D^{X}$  and  $D^{Z}$  are based on valid metrics, for any  $\lambda > 0$ ,  $(D^{X} \ominus_{\lambda} D^{Z})$  fulfills the metric axioms of non-negativity, symmetry, identity, and triangle inequality.

Furthermore, the operator has the property of maintaining the original structure under an uninformative prior. More formally, we define  $N_{k}^{D}(i) = \{j\in kNN(i)$  according to  $D\}$  to be the  $k$ -neighborhood of sample  $i$  according to distances  $D_{ij}$ . For simplicity of notation, we will assume that all distances are distinct, the results and definitions can directly be generalized to the case of equal distances. Assuming an uninformative prior, which was generated independently of the high dimensional data  $D^{Z}\perp \bar{D}^{X}$ , on expectation the neighborhoods of each point stay the same.

Theorem 3 (Uninformative prior (proof in App. A.1.4)). Assume the prior is uninformative, that is  $D^{Z} \perp D^{X}$ . Furthermore, the distances are normalized to  $D_{ij}^{Z} \in [0,1]$ . For fixed  $\lambda > 0$  let  $(F_{\lambda})_{ij} = D^{X} \ominus_{\lambda} D^{Z}$ . On expectation, the neighborhoods in  $X$  and in  $X$  with factored out prior are the same, that is  $\forall i, k$ .  $N_{k}^{F_{\lambda}}(i) = {}_{E[.]}N_{k}^{D^{X}}(i)$ .

Normalizing the distances as discussed above, and applying the  $\ominus_{\lambda}$  to factor out prior knowledge, we obtain an embedding algorithm independent method to factor out prior knowledge. In reminiscence of how the plots look, we refer to this method as CONFETTI and give its pseudocode as Alg. 1.

Complexity CONFETTI runs in time  $O(n^{2})$ , which includes the normalization of the distance matrix and computation of the operator, which only counts towards a very small constant. Additionally, we will need to run an embedding algorithm, which respective runtime is added to  $O(n^{2})$ .

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate on both synthetic and real world data. We make the implementations of JEDI and CONFETTI available online. Since there does not exist any direct competitor that can factor out arbitrary distance matrices from an embedding, we compare to two closest competitors. The first is ctSNE (Kang et al., 2019), which extends the tSNE objective and can factor out prior information given as cluster labels. The second is supervised LLE (De Ridder et al., 2003), which although originally designed to emphasize structure in the embedding given as labels, we can modify such that it instead emphasizes any structure not in the prior. We give the details for this modification, which we refer to as  $\mathrm{SLLE}^{-1}$ , in App. B.1. For fair comparison, we optimize all parameters via grid search on a synthetic data hold out set, and use these throughout all experiments (see App. B.2).

# 4.1 RELIABLY FACTORING OUT DISTANCE PRIORS

We first consider synthetic data with known ground truth. In particular, we consider synthetic data of  $n = 2000$  samples over 14 dimensions, where dimensions 1-8 and 9-12 both exhibit 4 clusters of different sizes, while dimensions 13 and 14 are Gaussian noise. We give more details, as well as a tSNE plot in App. B.3. The cluster structure over the first 8 dimensions dominates the tSNE embedding. To discover information beyond these clusters, we provide JEDI and CONFETTI the euclidean distances over these 8 dimensions, and ctSNE and sLLE $^{-1}$  the ground truth cluster assignment as background knowledge. All methods finished within minutes, and we plot the results in Fig. 1. Although given the true labelling, ctSNE fails to satisfactorily factor out the prior knowledge, whereas our methods yield the 4 distinct clusters from dimension 9-12. Notably, when we provide JEDI with the ground truth label assignment, it yields similarly sharp clusters as sLLE $^{-1}$  (see App. 13).

To objectively quantify how well prior knowledge is factored out from an embedding, we propose to measure the similarity over neighborhoods. For two distance matrices  $D, D'$  and neighborhood size  $k$ , we define the neighbourhood overlap score (NOS) as  $\mathrm{NOS}(D, D', k) = \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |\{kNN \text{ of } i \text{ in } D\} \cap \{kNN \text{ of } i \text{ in } D'\}|$ . Correspondingly, for a distance matrix  $D$  and label

distribution  $L$ , we get  $\mathrm{NOS}(D, L, k) = \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{|L_i|} |\{kNN \text{ of } i \text{ in } D\} \cap \{L_i\}|$ . While this score lends itself for evaluation, it is hard to directly optimize (see App. B.3). Plotting  $\mathrm{NOS}(D^X, D^Y)$  for all neighborhood sizes  $k = 1 \ldots n$  allows us to assess how well we preserve information of the original data, whereas plotting  $\mathrm{NOS}(D^X, D^Z)$  allows us to assess how well we factor out prior knowledge from an embedding. As the id-line corresponds to a random neighbor encounter, we can measure the area between the NOS curve and id-line as a proxy for how well we preserve information, respectively how well we factor out prior knowledge.

For the synthetic data, the area between the curves and the id-line for ctSNE,  $\mathrm{SLLE}^{-1}$ , JEDI, and CONFETTI are .237, .344, .340, .344 when we compute the NOS between embedding and input data without prior. For the NOS between embedding and prior labels we have .037, .005, .003, .022, respectively (plots are given in App. Fig. 14). We see that, although not designed for labels as priors, JEDI factors out the prior almost ideally, as well as  $\mathrm{SLLE}^{-1}$ , and that CONFETTI performs slightly worse especially in small neighborhoods. When evaluating the NOS with regard to the euclidean distance prior, CONFETTI beats all other methods with an area between curves of only 0.002. Overall, ctSNE shows the worst NOS performance, which is also evident in the embedding (see Fig. 1). As for information captured in the embedding from the non-prior dimensions, JEDI, CONFETTI, and  $\mathrm{SLLE}^{-1}$  do equally well, putting ctSNE at a distance. Overall, JEDI and CONFETTI are perform on par with the state of the art given label priors, but perform at least as well given continuous priors, for which ctSNE and  $\mathrm{SLLE}^{-1}$  are not applicable.

# 4.2 RECOVERING FLOWER GEOMETRY

To evaluate on real data, we consider the Oxford flower dataset from Nilsback & Zisserman (2008), which consists of over 8000 images of flowers of 102 different classes. The data is given as a set of four pairwise distance matrices which are the Chi-squared distances of the color (HSV), the local shape and texture, the shape of the boundary, and the spatial distribution of petals of the flower, all computed on segmented flower images. Since only distance matrices are provided, ctSNE and  $\mathrm{SLLE}^{-1}$  are not applicable on this data. We will use the sum of all four matrices as high dimensional input. To keep the results interpretable, we subsample 40 images from 25 different classes each, by which we have  $n = 1000$  samples. We are interested whether our algorithms can factor out a prior that is known to be aggregated in real world input data, and thus specify the HSV color matrix as prior. CONFETTI and JEDI terminate in seconds, respectively two minutes.

We give the vanilla tSNE embedding in Fig. 2a, which besides a clustering according to colour conveys little other information. When we factor out the color information with JEDI and CONFETTI, we see that colors mix and new clusters form according to other features. For example, spiky petals arrange at the one side (Fig. 2b bottom, Fig. 2c bottom right), whereas rounded petals assemble on the respective other side of the space. Similarly, flowers with few but large petals gather on one side (Fig. 2b right, Fig. 2c top) and flowers with many thin petals on the respective other side. Apart from these visual changes, we can evaluate based on the NOS plot, which shows that also for this metric prior our methods are able to factor out the background knowledge (see App. Fig. 15).

# 4.3 BATCH EFFECTS IN SINGLE CELL SEQUENCING

One of the major applications of embeddings such as tSNE and UMAP is in single cell sequencing, where it is a standard routine to visualize the sequencing data, allowing e.g. to assess the quality of sequencing, to easily remove outliers from the data, or highlight differences between cohorts. To test the methods on such data, we use a recent single cell data set of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and whole blood of multiple sclerosis patients and a control group (Schafflick et al., 2020). We generate a vanilla UMAP embedding using their original jupyter notebooks, and plot it as Fig. 3a. It shows the typical clustering according to the cell types in blood and CSF, when coloring the samples according to gene expression of standard marker genes (for more information refer to the original paper). Here, we are interested whether our methods can reveal information beyond cell type. We thus take the euclidean distance between the marker gene expression levels of each sample as prior, corresponding to how the coloring was obtained. As ctSNE cannot deal with continuous priors, we instead provide it the cluster labels from an agglomerative clustering of the marker gene expression levels, which yielded the same number of clusters as the original paper (see App. Fig. 16b).  $\mathrm{SLLE}^{-1}$  requires a matrix inversion, and for this data gives an error hinting that the data matrix is too large. ctSNE terminated within 23 minutes, CONFETTI in 10 minutes, and JEDI in 100h.

The results of CONFETTI show a surprising separation of samples from different batches and accordingly separation of the different tissue (blood and CSF), and of case and control along a manifold. Encouraged by these results, we also apply CONFETTI with tissue information as prior, and then observe that the previously separated clusters for actually equal cell types (B1,B2, NK1,NK2, mDC1,mDC2) are now merged (see App. Fig. 17), while all other information is kept. For ctSNE, there are no clusters or manifolds directly visible and the result is a rather homogeneous ball, which show only a clear separation of CD4 cells, which make up the largest proportion of cells (compare App. Fig. 16a). Similar to ctSNE, JEDI shows no clear separation of cell types (see App. Fig. 18), but there is no bias towards CD4 cells as for ctSNE.

# 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In the experiments, we show that both JEDI and CONFETTI correctly factor out prior knowledge and result embeddings that reveal previously hidden structure. On synthetic data, when provided with euclidean distances capturing the structure which dominates the vanilla tSNE embedding, both our methods reveal the clustering of the input data that is independent of the background knowledge. Our closest competitor ctSNE, is not able to factor out the background knowledge well, and its embeddings still show structure of the prior even when given the true class labels. When we provide our methods the same information, they do recover the correct clustering, demonstrating their ability to reliably factor out both distances as well as label priors.

On real world data of flower images, where distance matrices between attributes of the images are available, both JEDI and CONFETTI are able to factor out the property dominating the vanilla tSNE embedding, and organizing flowers according to number and shape of petals rather than by color. This shows that both are able applicable to real world settings, and unlike their competitors, can consider both input data and background knowledge in the form of different distance metrics.

On the perhaps most widespread application of low dimensional embeddings, single cell gene expression data, we confirm that tSNE based approaches are a bad fit; both ctSNE and JEDI get lost in local detail, fail to factor out the prior knowledge, and are slow. When we combine our algorithm-independent approach, CONFETTI, with UMAP we do arrive at meaningful embeddings from which the background knowledge has been factored out. In particular, when we provide it with prior knowledge of marker gene expression – which is used to determine cell type – we arrive at an embedding that organizes samples according to batch id and tissue type. Conversely, if provided with tissue type as prior, we observe that previously separate clusters, that actually contain cells of the same type, are merged.

Overall, both our proposals solve the problem of factoring prior knowledge from low dimensional embeddings, and by allowing the prior knowledge to be specified as distances they are both applicable to a large number of data types and domains. While JEDI has a theoretically appealing objective, it inherits all strength and weaknesses of tSNE by which especially its runtime is an open problem. For tSNE, several methods have been proposed that significantly speed up the optimization, yet none of them seem directly applicable to JEDI. We leave their adaptation for future work. Furthermore, although yielding overall good results, we would like to more closely investigate the parameters of tSNE and JEDI in a more principled way, as for new domains parameter settings for e.g. tSNE are mostly found by trial and error. Here, we tested our methods on different types distance metrics that cover different applications, and with single cell gene expressions one of the most important domains for low dimensional embeddings. In the future, we would also like to investigate how our methods perform when provided with more exotic types of background knowledge.
