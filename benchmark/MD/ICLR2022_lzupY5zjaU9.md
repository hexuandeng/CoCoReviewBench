# ABSTRACT

In distribution compression, one aims to accurately summarize a probability distribution  $\mathbb{P}$  using a small number of representative points. Near-optimal thinning procedures achieve this goal by sampling  $n$  points from a Markov chain and identifying  $\sqrt{n}$  points with  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{n})$  distributional discrepancy to  $\mathbb{P}$ . Unfortunately, these same algorithms suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic runtime in the sample size  $n$ . To address this deficiency, we introduce a simple metaprocedure—Compress++—for speeding up any input thinning algorithm while suffering at most a factor of four in error. When combined with the quadratic-time kernel halving and kernel thinning algorithms of Dwivedi and Mackey (2021), Compress++ delivers  $\sqrt{n}$  points with  $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log n/n})$  integration error and better-than-Monte-Carlo maximum mean discrepancy in  $\mathcal{O}(n\log^2 n)$  time and  $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}\log^2(n))$  space. Moreover, Compress++ enjoys the same near-linear runtime given any quadratic-time input and reduces the runtime of super-quadratic algorithms by a square-root factor. In our benchmarks with high-dimensional Monte Carlo samples and long-running Markov chains targeting challenging differential equation posteriors, Compress++ matches or nearly matches the accuracy of its input algorithm in orders of magnitude less time.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Distribution compression—constructing a concise summary of a probability distribution—is at the heart of many learning and inference tasks. For example, in Monte Carlo integration and Bayesian inference,  $n$  representative points are sampled i.i.d. or from a Markov chain to approximate expectations and quantify uncertainty under an intractable (posterior) distribution (Robert & Casella, 1999). However, these standard sampling strategies represent a bottleneck in computationally-demanding settings due to their slow root- $n$  Monte Carlo error rate. For instance, the Monte Carlo estimate  $\mathbb{P}_n f \triangleq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i)$  of an unknown expectation  $\mathbb{P}f \triangleq \mathbb{E}_{X \sim \mathbb{P}}[f(X)]$  based on  $n$  i.i.d. points has  $\Theta(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$  integration error  $|\mathbb{P}_n f - \mathbb{P}f|$ , requiring  $n = 10000$  points for  $1\%$  relative error and  $n = 10^6$  points for  $0.1\%$  error. Such bloated sample representations preclude downstream applications with critically expensive function evaluations like computational cardiology, where a 1000-CPU-hour tissue or organ simulation is required for each sample point (Niederer et al., 2011; Augustin et al., 2016; Strocchi et al., 2020), or expert data annotation which can be monetarily expensive Beaugnon et al. (2017), and is sometimes coined as the human bottleneck of machine learning.

To restore the feasibility of such critically expensive tasks, it is common to thin down the initial sequence of points to a produce a much smaller coreset. The standard thinning approach, select every  $t$ -th sample point (Owen, 2017), is simple to implement but often leads to an substantial increase in error: e.g., standard thinning  $n$  points from a fast-mixing Markov chain yields  $\Omega(n^{-\frac{1}{4}})$  error when  $n^{\frac{1}{2}}$  points are returned. Recently, Dwivedi & Mackey (2021b;a) introduced a more effective alternative, kernel thinning, that provides near optimal  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$  error when compressing  $n$  points down to size  $n^{\frac{1}{2}}$ . While practical for moderate sample sizes, the runtime of this algorithm scales quadratically with the input size  $n$ , making its execution prohibitive for very large input sizes. Our goal is to significantly improve the runtime of such compression algorithms while providing comparable error guarantees.

Problem setup Given a sequence  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$  of  $n$  input points summarizing a target distribution  $\mathbb{P}$ , our aim is to identify a high quality coreset  $S_{\mathrm{out}}$  of size  $\sqrt{n}$  in time nearly linear in  $n$ . We measure coreset

quality via its integration error  $|\mathbb{P}f - \mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{out}}f| \triangleq |\mathbb{P}f - \frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{out}}|}\sum_{x \in \mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{out}}} f(x)|$  for functions  $f$  in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)  $\mathcal{H}$  induced by a given kernel  $\mathbf{k}$  (Berlinet & Thomas-Agnan, 2011). We consider both single function error and kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD, Gretton et al., 2012), the worst-case integration error over the unit RKHS norm ball:

$$
\operatorname {M M D} _ {\mathbf {k}} (\mathbb {P}, \mathbb {P} _ {\text {o u t}}) \triangleq \sup  _ {\| f \| _ {\mathbf {k}} \leq 1} | \mathbb {P} f - \mathbb {P} _ {\text {o u t}} f | = \| \mathbb {P} \mathbf {k} - \mathbb {P} _ {\text {o u t}} \mathbf {k} \| _ {\mathbf {k}}.
$$

Our contributions We introduce a new simple meta procedure—COMPRESS++—that significantly speeds up a generic thinning algorithm while simultaneously inheriting the error guarantees of its input up to a factor of four. A direct application of COMPRESS++ to kernel thinning improves its quadratic  $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$  runtime to near linear  $\mathcal{O}(n\log^2 n)$  time while maintaining the error guarantees up to a factor four. Since the  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$  KT MMD guarantees of Dwivedi & Mackey (2021b) match the  $\Omega(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$  minimax lower bounds of Tolstikhin et al. (2017); Phillips & Tai (2020) up to factors of  $\sqrt{\log(n)}$  and constants depending on  $d$ , KT-COMPRESS++ also provides near-optimal MMD compression for a wide range of kernels and distributions  $\mathbb{P}$ . Moreover, the practical gains from applying COMPRESS++ are substantial: KT thins 65,000 points in 10 dimensions in 20m, while KT-COMPRESS++ needs only 1.5m; KT takes more than a day to thin 250,000 points in 100 dimensions, while KT-COMPRESS++ takes less than an hour (a  $32\times$  speed-up).

$\mathrm{COMPRESS}++$  can also be directly combined with any thinning algorithm, even those that have suboptimal guarantees but often perform well in practice, like kernel herding (Chen et al., 2010), support points (Mak & Joseph, 2018), Stein points (MCMC) (Chen et al., 2018; 2019), and Stein thinning (Riabiz et al., 2020a), all of which run in  $\Omega(n^2)$  time. As a demonstration, we combine  $\mathrm{COMPRESS}++$  with the popular kernel herding algorithm and observe  $10 - 60 \times$  speed-ups. In all of our experiments,  $\mathrm{COMPRESS}++$  leads to minimal loss in accuracy and, surprisingly, even improves upon herding accuracy for lower-dimensional problems.

Overview of COMPRESS++ To define COMPRESS++, we first introduce COMPRESS: A simple and elegant recursive strategy takes in a halving algorithm and provides an intermediate thinned coreset in significantly faster runtime. COMPRESS divides the coreset into four parts, recursively applies COMPRESS to each, combines the output of each and halves the resulting coreset to get the output. Then COMPRESS++ with a thinning algorithm ALG is defined as follows: In stage one, use COMPRESS with ALG instantiated for 2-thinning, to obtain an intermediate coreset of size  $2^{\mathfrak{g}}\sqrt{n}$  for a suitable parameter  $\mathfrak{g}$ , and then in stage two apply ALG directly to further thin it down to  $\sqrt{n}$  points. In this manner, ALG is ever applied to coresets of size  $2^{\mathfrak{g}}\sqrt{n}$  or smaller thereby improving the runtime. The parameter  $\mathfrak{g}$  is chosen based on the run-time and known guarantees of the underlying thinning algorithm, but a default choice of 4 can be shown to be optimal in several theoretical settings, and it provided competitive performance across all our experiments. Overall, with  $n$  input points and a thinning algorithm with runtime  $n^{\alpha}$ , COMPRESS++ uses a outputs  $\sqrt{n}$  points in time  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\alpha/2})$  with errors similar to those provided by the input thinning algorithm.

Notation We write  $S_{\mathrm{ALG}}$  for the coreset outputted by an algorithm ALG and extend our MMD definition for point sequences  $(S_1,S_2)$  with empirical distributions  $(\mathbb{Q}_1,\mathbb{Q}_2)$  via  $\mathrm{MMD_k}(\mathcal{S}_1,\mathcal{S}_2)\triangleq$ $\mathrm{MMD_k}(\mathbb{Q}_1,\mathbb{Q}_2)$  and  $\mathrm{MMD_k}(\mathbb{P},\mathcal{S}_1)\triangleq \mathrm{MMD_k}(\mathbb{P},\mathbb{Q}_1)$ . We use  $a\precsim b$  and  $a\succsim b$  to mean  $a = \mathcal{O}(b)$  and  $a = \Omega (b)$  and use  $\prec_{\mathbf{k}}$  to denote that the underlying constants depend on  $\mathbf{k}$ .

Basic definitions We use  $\mathcal{H}$  to denote an inner-product space endowed with the inner-product  $\langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$ . We start with the definition of sub-gamma random variables (Boucheron et al., 2013).

Definition 1 (f-Sub-Gamma) A random variable  $X$  is said to be sub-gamma on the right with parameters  $(\sigma^2, c)$  denoted by  $\Gamma_+(\sigma^2, c)$  if for all  $0 < \lambda < \frac{1}{c}$ , we have  $\mathbb{E}[\exp(\lambda X)] \leq \exp\left(\frac{\lambda^2 \sigma^2}{2(1 - c \lambda)}\right)$ . For any  $f \in \mathcal{H}$ , we say that a random variable  $G$  on  $\mathcal{H}$  is  $f$ -sub-gamma on the right, denoted by  $\Gamma_+(\sigma^2, c)$ , if the random variable  $\langle f, G \rangle_{\mathcal{H}} \in \Gamma_+(\sigma^2, c)$ .

As a reminder, we note that  $c = 0$  yields a sub-Gaussian tails on the right. For  $X \in \Gamma_{+}(\sigma^{2},c)$ , Boucheron et al. (2013, Section 2.4) shows that for  $t \geq 0$ , and  $\delta \in (0,1]$ , we have

$$
\mathbb {P} [ X > \sqrt {2 \sigma^ {2} t} + c t ] \leq e ^ {- t}, \quad \text {o r e q u i v a l e n t l y} \quad \mathbb {P} [ X \leq \sqrt {2 \sigma^ {2} \log (\frac {1}{\delta})} + c \log (\frac {1}{\delta}) ] \geq 1 - \delta . \tag {1}
$$

A property that we frequently use is that the sub-gamma property is suitably closed under multiplication and addition of sub-gamma random variables. A discussion is deferred to App. A.

Definition 2 (Thinning and halving algorithms) Consider an algorithm ALG that takes as input a point sequence  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$  of size  $n$  and returns a (possibly random) subsequence  $S_{\mathrm{ALG}} \subset S_{\mathrm{in}}$  of size  $n_{\mathrm{out}}$ . We say that ALG is  $\alpha_n$ -thinning if  $n_{\mathrm{out}} = n / \alpha_n$  whenever  $n / \alpha_n \in \mathbb{N}$ . When  $\alpha_n = 2$ , we say that ALG is a Halving algorithm, and when  $\alpha_n = \sqrt{n}$ , we say ALG is root-thinning.

For a thinning algorithm ALG, we associate a kernel discrepancy embedding that measures the approximation quality for the  $n$  input points  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$  provided by the  $n_{\mathrm{out}}$  points  $S_{\mathrm{ALG}}$  output by ALG:

$$
\psi_ {\mathrm {A L G}} \left(\mathcal {S} _ {\text {i n}}\right) \triangleq \sum_ {x \in \mathcal {S} _ {\text {i n}}} \mathbf {k} (x, \cdot) - \frac {n}{n _ {\text {o u t}}} \sum_ {x \in \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {A L G}}} \mathbf {k} (x, \cdot). \tag {2}
$$

Letting  $\mathbb{P}_S$  denote the empirical distribution of  $S$ , the reproducing property of  $\mathbf{k}$  yields that

$$
\mathbb {P} _ {\mathcal {S} _ {\text {i n}}} f - \mathbb {P} _ {\mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {A L G}}} f = \frac {1}{n} \langle f, \psi_ {\mathrm {A L G}} \rangle_ {\mathbf {k}}, \text {f o r a n y} f \in \mathcal {H}, \quad \text {a n d} \quad \operatorname {M M D} \left(\mathcal {S} _ {\text {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {A L G}}\right) = \frac {1}{n} \| \psi_ {\mathrm {A L G}} \| _ {\mathbf {k}}. \tag {3}
$$

Next, we define the notion of a sub-gamma thinning algorithm via the object  $\psi_{\mathrm{ALG}}$  (2).

Definition 3 (Sub-Gamma Thinning Algorithm) Given the functions  $f \in \mathcal{H}$ ,  $\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}_+$  and  $c : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}_+$ , an  $\alpha_n$ -thinning algorithm ALG is called  $f$ -sub-gamma on the right with parameters  $(\sigma^2, c)$ , if  $\psi_{\mathrm{ALG}}(S_{\mathrm{in}}) \in \Gamma_+^f(\sigma^2(n), c(n))$  conditioned on  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$  of size  $n$ .

When the algorithm is both  $\Gamma_{+}^{f}$  and  $\Gamma_{+}^{-f}$ -sub-gamma, (1) and (3) immediately imply a high probability tail bound on the integration error  $|\mathbb{P}_{\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{in}}}f - \mathbb{P}_{\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{ALG}}}f|$ .

# 2 COMPRESS

We now introduce our first meta procedure COMPRESS (which is also a building block for COMPRESS++) COMPRESS takes as input a halving algorithm HALVE and a oversampling factor  $\mathfrak{g}$ , and then given any input of size  $n$ , it outputs at thinned coreset of size  $2^{\mathfrak{g}}\sqrt{n}$ .

The algorithm is extremely simple to implement: first, divide the input sequence into four subsequences of size  $\frac{n}{4}$  (in any manner the user chooses); second, recursively call COMPRESS on each subsequence to produce four coresets of size  $2^{\mathfrak{g} - 1}\sqrt{n}$ ; finally, call HALVE on the concatenation of those coresets to produce the final output of size  $2^{\mathfrak{g}}\sqrt{n}$ . We denote this algorithm as COMPRESS(HALVE, g), and describe it formally in Alg. 1. COMPRESS can also be implemented in a streaming fashion but we defer the discussion to App. G. We remind that COMPRESS with  $\mathfrak{g} = 0$  is a root thinning algorithm.

# Algorithm 1: COMPRESS

Input: Halving algorithm HALVE, oversampling factor  $\mathfrak{g}$ , point sequence  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$  of size  $n$   
if  $n = 4^{\mathfrak{g}}$  then return  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$   
else  
Partition  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$  into four subsets  $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^4$  each of size  $n/4$   
for  $i = 1,2,3,4$  do  
 $\widetilde{S}_i \gets \text{COMPRESS}(S_i, \text{HALVE}, \mathfrak{g})$  // return coresets of size  $2^{\mathfrak{g}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{n}{4}}$   
end  
 $\widetilde{S} \gets \text{CONCATENATE}(\widetilde{S}_1, \widetilde{S}_2, \widetilde{S}_3, \widetilde{S}_4)$  // coreset of size  $2 \cdot 2^{\mathfrak{g}} \cdot \sqrt{n}$ $S \gets \text{HALVE}(\mathbf{k}, \widetilde{S})$  // coreset of size  $2^{\mathfrak{g}} \sqrt{n}$   
return  $S$   
end

# 2.1 SUB-GAMMA PROPERTY AND RUNTIME GUARANTEES FOR COMPRESS

We now establish the sub-gamma property and runtime of COMPRESS in terms of the input halving algorithm HALVE. We measure computational complexity in terms of the dominant operations done by the halving algorithms (e.g., kernel computations with kernel thinning), and ignore the time taken for reading and writing to memory. See App. B for the proof. In the result, our notation highlights explicitly the dependence of  $\sigma^2$ ,  $c$  and  $r_{\mathrm{CP}}$  on  $\mathfrak{g}$ .

Theorem 1 (Sub-gamma property and runtime of COMPRESS) Let HALVE denote a  $\Gamma_{+}^{f}$ -halving algorithm with parameters  $(\sigma_{\mathrm{HALVE}}^2, c_{\mathrm{HALVE}})$ , with running time  $r_{\mathrm{HALVE}}(n)$  on inputs of size  $n$ . Then with inputs of size  $n$ , COMPRESS(HALVE,  $\mathfrak{g}$ ) outputs a coreset of size  $2^{\mathfrak{g}}\sqrt{n}$ , and is  $\Gamma_{+}^{f}$ -thinning with parameters

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {C P}} ^ {2} (n, \mathfrak {g}) \triangleq \frac {n}{4 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1}} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\log_ {4} n - \mathfrak {g} - 1} \sigma_ {\mathrm {H A L V E}} ^ {2} \left(2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1 - i} \sqrt {n}\right) \leq \frac {n}{4 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1}} \left(\log_ {4} n - \mathfrak {g}\right) \sigma_ {\mathrm {H A L V E}} ^ {2} \left(2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1} \sqrt {n}\right), \tag {4}
$$

$$
c _ {\mathrm {C P}} (n, \mathfrak {g}) \triangleq \max  _ {0 \leq i \leq \log_ {4} n - \mathfrak {g} - 1} \left[ \frac {\sqrt {n}}{2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + i + 1}} c _ {\mathrm {H A L V E}} \big (\sqrt {n} 2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1 - i} \big) \right],
$$

and has the computational complexity bounded by

$$
r _ {\mathrm {C P}} (n, \mathfrak {g}) = \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\log_ {4} n - \mathfrak {g} - 1} 4 ^ {i} r _ {\mathrm {H A L V E}} \left(2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1} \sqrt {n 4 ^ {- i}}\right).
$$

Remark 1 (Worst-case guarantee for COMPRESS) For any monotone  $\sigma_{\mathrm{HALVE}}^2$  and  $c_{\mathrm{HALVE}}$ , we have  $\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{CP}}^2(n,0)}{n^2} \leq \frac{1}{4n}\sigma_{\mathrm{HALVE}}^2(2\sqrt{n})(\log_4 n)$  and  $\frac{c_{\mathrm{CP}}}{n} \leq \frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}} c_{\mathrm{HALVE}}(2\sqrt{n})$ . Recall from (1), this gives us a high probability bound on  $\frac{1}{n}\langle f, \psi_{\mathrm{CP}} \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$ . From (3), this bounds the integration error  $\mathbb{P}_{S_{\mathrm{in}}}f - \mathbb{P}_{S_{\mathrm{CP}}}f$ . Comparing this with the corresponding expressions for HALVE for compressing an input of size  $2\sqrt{n}$  to  $\sqrt{n}$ , we find that in the worst case the error from COMPRESS is only a logarithmic factor larger. In particular, this shows that the COMPRESS algorithm gives guarantees that are only a logarithmic factor increase in error compared other methods of combining HALVE to get a root-thinning algorithm (such as RECHALVE discussed in App. H).

Remark 2 (Explicit speed-up of runtimes) Let us demonstrate how COMPRESS speeds up a thinning algorithm. For ease of discussion set  $\mathfrak{g} = 0$ . First, we note that  $r_{\mathrm{CP}}(n)\lesssim \log n\cdot r_{\mathrm{HALVE}}(2\sqrt{n})$ . Thus, the running time is upper bounded by a logarithmic factor over the running HALVE on a much smaller input of size  $2\sqrt{n}$ . Consequently, COMPRESS provides a significant improvement for any halving algorithm with super-linear runtime. Unrolling the recursion for explicit polynomial runtime, we find that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \cdot r _ {\mathrm {H A L V E}} (n) = C n ^ {2} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad r _ {\mathrm {C P}} (n) = C (\log n - \mathfrak {g}) 4 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1} n \\ \cdot r _ {\mathrm {H A L V E}} (n) = C n ^ {k} \text {f o r} k > 2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad r _ {\mathrm {C P}} = C n ^ {k / 2} 2 ^ {k \mathfrak {g} + k} \\ \end{array}
$$

Note that in both these settings, we get an approximately quadratic speed up. In particular, for kernel thinning the speed up is from  $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$  to  $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ , which also provides significant speed up in practice as our experiments later demonstrate.

Remark 3 (Explicit bounds on sub-gamma parameters) Unrolling the recursion (4), we now derive an explicit expression for  $\sigma_{\mathrm{CP}}^2 (n,\mathfrak{g})$  under the following growth conditions on  $\sigma_{\mathrm{HALVE}}^2$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} \cdot \sigma_ {\mathrm {H A L V E}} ^ {2} (n) = C \log_ {4} n \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \sigma_ {\mathrm {C P}} ^ {2} (n, \mathfrak {g}) = C \frac {n}{4 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1}} \cdot \frac {1}{4} (\log_ {4} n + 3 \mathfrak {g} + 3) (\log_ {4} n - \mathfrak {g}) \\ \bullet \sigma_ {\mathrm {H A L V E}} ^ {2} (n) = C \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \sigma_ {\mathrm {C P}} ^ {2} (n, \mathfrak {g}) = C n 4 ^ {- \mathfrak {g} - 1} (\log_ {4} n - \mathfrak {g}). \\ \end{array}
$$

Example 1 (KT-SPLIT meets COMPRESS.) We now illustrate the gains of COMPRESS with the KT-SPLIT algorithm introduced in Dwivedi & Mackey (2021a, Alg1a.). Given a target kernel  $\mathbf{k}$ , KT-SPLIT uses non-uniform randomness to recursively thin an input sequence  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$  of size  $n$  to a sequence  $S_{\mathrm{out}}$  of size  $n / \alpha$ . Its runtime is bounded as  $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ , and thus Rem. 2 immediately yields that COMPRESS leads to an  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right)$  speed-up in runtime—thereby reducing the runtime of KT from days to 10 minutes for a million samples in 100 dimensions as seen in Fig. 1.

Next, we show that the single function error of COMPRESS is at most  $\sqrt{\log n}$  times worse than that of KT-SPLIT. With  $\alpha = 2$ , Dwivedi & Mackey (2021a, Thm 1, Rem. 1a) then implies that for any  $f$  in the RKHS of  $\mathbf{k}$ , we have

$$
\frac {1}{n} \left| \sum_ {x \in \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {i n}}} f (x) - 2 \sum_ {x \in \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {o u t}}} f (x) \right| \leq \frac {1}{n} \sqrt {\frac {3 2 \log 4}{3} \| \mathbf {k} \| _ {\infty}} \| f \| _ {\mathbf {k}} \left(\sqrt {\log (2 n) \log \left(\frac {1}{\delta}\right)} + \log \left(\frac {1}{\delta}\right)\right)
$$

with probability  $1 - \delta$ . Inverting this bound, we obtain that  $\operatorname*{Pr}\left[\left|\sum_{x\in S_{\mathrm{in}}}f(x) - 2\sum_{x\in S_{\mathrm{out}}}f(x)\right|\geq c_nt + \sqrt{2\sigma_n^2t}\right]\leq e^{-t}$  for  $c_{n} = \sqrt{\frac{32\log 4}{3}\|\mathbf{k}\|_{\infty}}\| f\|_{\mathbf{k}}$  and  $\sigma_{n}^{2} = \frac{4\log 4}{3}\log (2n)\cdot \| f\|_{\mathbf{k}}^{2}\| \mathbf{k}\|_{\infty}$ . Applying (Boucheron et al., 2013, Theorem 2.3), we thus conclude that KT-SPLIT (in the halving mode) is  $\Gamma_+^f\big(32\sigma_n^2 +64c_n^2,8c_n\big)$ -sub-gamma.

Having established the sub-gamma property of KT-SPLIT halving, we can directly apply Theorem 1 to show that  $\mathrm{COMPRESS}(\mathrm{KT - SPLIT},\mathfrak{g})$  is also  $\Gamma_{+}^{f}$  sub-gamma with parameters

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {C P}} ^ {2} \leq 2 3 7 \cdot \frac {n}{4 ^ {\mathfrak {g}}} \| f \| _ {\mathbf {k}} ^ {2} \| \mathbf {k} \| _ {\infty} (\log n + 3 \mathfrak {g} + 3) (\log n - \mathfrak {g}), \quad \text {a n d} \quad c _ {\mathrm {C P}} \leq 2 2 \sqrt {\| \mathbf {k} \| _ {\infty}} \| f \| _ {\mathbf {k}},
$$

which in turn implies that for  $\mathfrak{g} = 0$ , we have

$$
\left| \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {x \in \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {i n}}} f (x) - \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}} \sum_ {x \in \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {C P}}} f (x) \right| \leq \frac {2 2 \| f \| _ {\mathbf {k}} \sqrt {\| \mathbf {k} \| _ {\infty}}}{\sqrt {n}} \left[ \sqrt {(\log^ {2} n + 3 \log n) \log \left(\frac {1}{\delta}\right)} + \log \left(\frac {1}{\delta}\right) \right]
$$

with probability  $1 - \delta$ , which is at most  $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$  worse than the KT-SPLIT guarantee itself.

# 2.2 MMD GUARANTEES FOR COMPRESS

Next, we turn attention to establishing the worst-case function error, namely the MMD guarantees for COMPRESS. For brevity, we give simplified upper bounds on the error parameters. For the exact expressions and the proof, see App. D. Here  $S_{\mathrm{CP}}$  denotes the output of COMPRESS.

Theorem 2 (MMD Guarantees for COMPRESS) Let HALVE be a halving algorithm such that for any size  $n$  input it satisfies

$$
\mathbb {P} \big [ \mathrm {M M D} (\mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {H A L V E}}) \geq a _ {n} + \sqrt {2 v _ {n} t} + c _ {n} t \big ] \leq e ^ {- t} f o r a l l t \geq 0, \quad a n d \quad \mathbb {E} \psi_ {\mathrm {H A L V E}} = 0.
$$

Then, COMPRESS(HALVE,  $\mathfrak{g}$ ) with size  $n$  input satisfies

$$
\Pr \left[ \mathrm {M M D} \left(\mathcal {S} _ {\text {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {C P}}\right) \geq \sigma_ {\mathrm {M}, \mathrm {C P}} \cdot \sqrt {2 t} + 2 t R _ {\mathrm {M}, \mathrm {C P}} \right] \leq 2 (n + 1) e ^ {- t} \quad f o r a l l \quad t \geq 0, \tag {5}
$$

where  $R_{\mathrm{M,CP}} \triangleq \sqrt{8v_q + 2a_q^2} + 4c_q$ , and  $\sigma_{\mathrm{M,CP}} \triangleq R_{\mathrm{M,CP}} \sqrt{\log_4 n - \mathfrak{g}}$  with  $q \triangleq \sqrt{n} 2^{\mathfrak{g} + 1}$ .

Remark 4 (Symmetrization) We can convert any halving algorithm into one that satisfies the mean zero condition  $\mathbb{E}\psi_{\mathrm{HALVE}} = 0$  without impacting integration error, by symmetrization, i.e., by returning either the outputted half or its complement with equal probability.

Example 2 (Kernel thinning meets COMPRESS.) For MMD guarantees, we analyze COMPRESS with kernel thinning of Dwivedi & Mackey (2021b, Alg 1.) as the halving algorithm with  $\mathfrak{g} = 0$ , so that the overall algorithm is root-thinning. We call this instantiation KT-Compress, and compare and contrast it to KT for root thinning.

First, we note that KT has a quadratic runtime of order  $n^2$ , so that COMPRESS once again provides a near linear  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right)$  speed-up by Rem. 2. Next, we claim that the MMD error for KT COMPRESS is at most  $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$  worse compared to KT, a mild degradation compared to the linear speed up. To prove this, first we note that for an output  $S_{\mathrm{KT}}$  of size  $\frac{n}{2^m}$  from KT, Dwivedi & Mackey (2021a, Thm. 2) guarantees that

$$
\operatorname {M M D} \left(\mathcal {S} _ {\text {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {K T}}\right) \stackrel {{\prec}} {{\prec}} _ {\mathbf {k}} \frac {2 ^ {m}}{n} + \frac {2 ^ {m}}{n} \sqrt {\log n \cdot \mathcal {M} _ {\mathbf {k}} \left(\mathcal {B} _ {2} (R) , \frac {2 ^ {m}}{n}\right)} \sqrt {\log (1 / \delta)} + \frac {2 ^ {m}}{n} \sqrt {\log n} \log (1 / \delta), \tag {6}
$$

with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ , where  $\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathcal{A},\varepsilon)$  denotes the  $\varepsilon-L^{\infty}$  cover of the unit ball of RKHS with domain restricted to the set  $\mathcal{A}$  (Dwivedi & Mackey (2021a, Def. 1)), and  $R \triangleq \max_{x \in S_{\mathrm{in}}} \|x\|_2$ . Inverting this bound, we conclude that KT as a halving algorithm (i.e.,  $m = 1$ ) satisfies the assumption of Theorem 2 with

$$
a _ {n} \precsim \frac {1}{n}, \quad v _ {n} \precsim_ {\mathbf {k}} \frac {\log n}{n ^ {2}} \cdot \mathcal {M} _ {\mathbf {k}} (\mathcal {B} _ {2} (R), \frac {2}{n}), \quad \text {a n d} \quad c _ {n} \precsim_ {\mathbf {k}} \frac {\sqrt {\log n}}{n}.
$$

Now applying Theorem 2, we find that KT compress admits the tail bound (5) with

$$
R _ {\mathrm {M}, \mathrm {K T} - \mathrm {C P}} \stackrel {\prec} {\sim} _ {\mathbf {k}} \sqrt {\log n \cdot \mathcal {M} _ {\mathbf {k}} (\mathcal {B} _ {2} (R) , \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}})} \quad \text {a n d} \quad \sigma_ {\mathrm {M}, \mathrm {K T} - \mathrm {C P}} \stackrel {\prec} {\sim} _ {\mathbf {k}} \log n \cdot \sqrt {\mathcal {M} _ {\mathbf {k}} (\mathcal {B} _ {2} (R) , \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}})}.
$$

Choosing  $t^{\star} = \log \left(\frac{2(n + 1)}{\delta}\right)$ , we conclude that the  $\sqrt{n}$  sized KT-compress output  $S_{\mathrm{KT - CP}}$  satisfies

$$
\operatorname {M M D} \left(\mathcal {S} _ {\text {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {K T - C P}}\right) \preceq_ {\mathbf {k}} \sqrt {\log n} \left(\sqrt {\log n \cdot \log \left(\frac {n}{\delta}\right)} + \log \left(\frac {n}{\delta}\right)\right) \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}} \sqrt {\mathcal {M} _ {\mathbf {k}} \left(\mathcal {B} _ {2} (R) , \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}}\right)}, \tag {7}
$$

with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ . On the other hand, with high probability the output from KT (when root thinning) itself satisfies  $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sqrt{\log n \cdot \mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathcal{B}_2(R), \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})}\sqrt{\log(1 / \delta)}$  where we note that this bound follows from (6) by substituting  $m = \frac{1}{2}\log_2n$ . Comparing (7) to the above bound, we conclude that KT-COMPRESS provides at most  $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$  worse MMD error than KT itself for general  $\mathbf{k}$ , and  $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{in}}$ .

# 3 COMPRESS ++

In this section, we introduce another simpleyet effective meta procedure—COMPRESS++—that uses a generic thinning algorithm along with COMPRESS in two stages. Overall, it provides a significantly improved error at the cost of a mild logarithmic overhead in the running time when compared to COMPRESS. Algorithmically, COMPRESS++ takes as input an  $\alpha$ -thinning algorithm (Def. 2)  $\mathrm{THIN}(\alpha)$  for  $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}$ . In the first stage, it runs COMPRESS with  $\mathrm{THIN}(2)$  as the halving procedure and oversampling factor  $\mathfrak{g}$  set to a non-zero quantity using  $\mathrm{THIN}(2)$  as the halving algorithm to reduce the size from  $n$  to  $\sqrt{n} 2^{\mathfrak{g}}$ . Next, we run the  $\mathrm{THIN}(2^{\mathfrak{g}})$  on the output of the first stage to thin the sequence down to size  $\sqrt{n}$ . We formally present this algorithm in Alg. 2.

Algorithm 2: COMPRESS++  
Input: Thinning algorithm THIN, Oversampling parameter g, Input point sequence  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$ $S_{\mathrm{COMPRESS}} \gets \mathrm{COMPRESS}(\mathrm{THIN}(2), \mathfrak{g}, S_{\mathrm{in}})$  // Coreset of size  $2^{\mathfrak{g}}\sqrt{n}$ $S_{\mathrm{COMPRESS++}} \gets \mathrm{THIN}(2^{\mathfrak{g}}, S_{\mathrm{CP}})$  // Coreset of size  $\sqrt{n}$   
return  $S_{\mathrm{CP++}}$

# 3.1 SUB-GAMMA PROPERTY AND RUNTIME GUARANTEES FOR COMPRESS++

First, we note the quality of the solution given by COMPRESS++ by expressing the  $\Gamma_{+}^{f}$  parameters in terms of those of THIN. The proof can be found in App. I.

Theorem 3 (Sub-gamma property and runtime of COMPRESS++) Let  $\mathrm{THIN}(\alpha)$  denote a  $\Gamma_{+}^{f}$ - $\alpha$ -thinning algorithm with parameters  $\sigma_{\mathrm{THIN}}^2(n, \alpha)$  and  $c_{\mathrm{THIN}}(n, \alpha)$ , and running time  $r_{\mathrm{THIN}}(n, \alpha)$  for inputs of size  $n$ . Then  $\mathrm{COMPRESS}++(\mathrm{THIN}, \mathfrak{g})$  is root-thinning and  $\Gamma_{+}^{f}$  with parameters

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {\mathrm {C P} + +} ^ {2} (n, \mathfrak {g}) = \frac {n}{4 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1}} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\log_ {4} n - g} \sigma_ {\mathrm {T H I N}} ^ {2} \left(2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1 - i} \sqrt {n}, 2\right) + \frac {n}{4 ^ {\mathfrak {g}}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {T H I N}} ^ {2} \left(2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}} \sqrt {n}, 2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}}\right) \\ \leq \frac {n}{4 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1}} \left(\log_ {4} n - \mathfrak {g}\right) \sigma_ {\mathrm {T H I N}} ^ {2} \left(2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1} \sqrt {n}, 2\right) + \frac {n}{4 ^ {\mathfrak {g}}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {T H I N}} ^ {2} \left(2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}} \sqrt {n}, 2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
c _ {\mathrm {C P} + +} (n, \mathfrak {g}) = \max  \biggl (\frac {\sqrt {n}}{2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}}} c _ {\mathrm {T H I N}} \bigl (2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}} \sqrt {n}, 2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}} \bigr), \max  _ {0 \leq i \leq \log_ {4} n - g - 1} \biggl (\frac {\sqrt {n}}{2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + i + 1}} c _ {\mathrm {T H I N}} \bigl (\sqrt {n} 2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1 - i}, 2 \bigr) \biggr) \biggr),
$$

with its runtime bounded as

$$
r _ {\mathrm {C P} + +} (n) = \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\log_ {4} n - \mathfrak {g} - 1} 4 ^ {i} r _ {\mathrm {T H I N}} \left(2 ^ {\mathfrak {g} + 1 - i} \sqrt {n}, 2\right) + r _ {\mathrm {T H I N}} \left(2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}} \sqrt {n}, 2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}}\right).
$$

With some algebra with expressions above, one can see the advantage of COMPRESS++ over COMPRESS. Setting  $g = \log_4\log_4n$ , we can see that

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {C P} + +} ^ {2} (n, \mathfrak {g}) \leq n \sigma_ {\mathrm {T H I N}} ^ {2} \left(2 \sqrt {n \log n}, 2\right) + \frac {n}{\log n} \sigma_ {\mathrm {T H I N}} ^ {2} \left(\sqrt {n \log n}, \sqrt {\log_ {4} n}\right)
$$

Normalizing by the size of the input, we get that the integration error of  $\mathrm{COMPRESS}++$  is comparable to error of just running  $\mathrm{THIN}$  on sets of size  $\sqrt{n\log n}$  to get an output of size  $\sqrt{n}$  and the error of halving a data set of size  $2\sqrt{n\log n}$ . Thus, the integration error is comparable to that of methods such as RecHalve (discussed in App. H). And, we note that  $\mathrm{COMPRESS}++$  provides a logarithmic factor improvement in error over  $\mathrm{COMPRESS}$ .

Example 3 (KT-SPLIT meets COMPRESS++) Example 1 showed that KT-SPLIT algorithm is  $\Gamma_{+}^{f}\left(32\sigma_{n,\alpha}^{2} + 64c_{n,\alpha}^{2},8c_{n,\alpha}\right)$  when the input size is  $n$  and the output size is  $n / \alpha$  with  $c_{n,\alpha} = \alpha \cdot \sqrt{\frac{32\log 4}{3}\|\mathbf{k}\|_{\infty}}\| f\|_{\mathbf{k}}$  and  $\sigma_{n,\alpha}^{2} = \alpha^{2}\frac{4\log 4}{3}\log (2n)$ . Thus, if we run COMPRESS++(KT-SPLIT,  $\mathfrak{g}$ ), we get  $\sigma_{\mathrm{CP} + + }^2\leq \frac{4096\log 4}{3}\| f\|_{\mathbf{k}}^2\| \mathbf{k}\|_{\infty}\left[n4^{-\mathfrak{g} - 1}(\log_4n - g)\log (2^{g + 2}\sqrt{n}) + n\log (2^{\mathfrak{g}}\sqrt{n})\right]$  and  $c_{\mathrm{CP} + + }$ $\sqrt{\frac{1024\log 4}{3}\|f\|_{\mathbf{k}}^2}\| \mathbf{k}\|_{\infty}\sqrt{n}$ . Setting,  $g = \log_4\log_4n$ , gives us  $\sigma_{\mathrm{CP} + + }^2$  which can be seen to be factor of two from the bound on the sub-gamma parameters for KT-SPLIT with  $\alpha = \sqrt{n}$ .

Optimal  $\mathfrak{g}$ : In this setting, we derive more precise bounds in App. J for optimal  $\mathfrak{g}$  (to minimize the error) and note there that large sample values of  $n = 10^7$ , a default choice of  $\mathfrak{g}_{opt} = 4$  suffices (which we also use in all our experiments). We highlight that with such a choice of  $g$ , the run-time is order  $\mathcal{O}n\log^2 n$ .

Next, we give MMD guarantees for COMPRESS++ in terms of the MMD guarantees of the thinning algorithm THIN. The proof can be found in App. K.

Theorem 4 (COMPRESS++ MMD Guarantees) Let  $\mathrm{THIN}(\alpha)$  is an  $\alpha$ -thinning algorithm such that on input  $S_{\mathrm{in}}$  of size  $n$  outputs  $S_{\mathrm{THIN}(\alpha)}$  such that

$$
\Pr \left[ \operatorname {M M D} \left(\mathcal {S} _ {\text {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {T H I N} (\alpha)}\right) \geq a _ {n, \alpha} + \sqrt {2 v _ {n , \alpha} t} + c _ {n, \alpha} t \right] \leq e ^ {- t} \quad a n d \quad \mathbb {E} \psi_ {\mathrm {T H I N} (2)} = 0.
$$

Then, the  $\sqrt{n}$  sized output  $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{CP} + + }$  of  $\mathrm{COMPRESS} + + (\mathrm{THIN},\mathfrak{g})$  satisfies

$$
\operatorname * {P r} \left[ \mathrm {M M D} (\mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {C P} + +}) \geq a _ {s} + \sqrt {2 (\sigma_ {\mathrm {M , C P}} ^ {2} + v _ {s}) t} + (c _ {s} + 2 R _ {\mathrm {M , C P}}) t \right] \leq 2 (n + 2) e ^ {- t},
$$

where  $s \triangleq (2^{\mathfrak{g}}\sqrt{n}, 2^{\mathfrak{g}})$ , and  $(R_{\mathrm{M,CP}}, \sigma_{\mathrm{M,CP}})$  were defined in Theorem 2.

Example 4 (Kernel thinning meets COMPRESS++.) We now illustrate the advantages of COMPRESS++, which we call KT-Compress++, defined as COMPRESS++ with kernel thinning Dwivedi & Mackey (2021b, Alg 1.) as the thinning algorithm. Let  $S_{\mathrm{KT - CP}}$  and  $S_{\mathrm{KT - CP + + }}$  denote the output of the two stages of COMPRESS++.

Recall from Example 2 that

$$
\mathrm {M M D} (\mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {K T - C P}}) \stackrel {\prec} {\sim} _ {\mathbf {k}} \sqrt {\log n} \Big (\sqrt {\log n \cdot \log (\frac {n}{\delta})} + \log (\frac {n}{\delta}) \Big) \frac {1}{2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}} \sqrt {n}} \sqrt {\mathcal {M} _ {\mathbf {k}} (\mathcal {B} _ {2} (R) , \frac {1}{2 ^ {\mathfrak {g}} \sqrt {n}})},
$$

with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ . Also, recall that for thinning a set of size  $2^g \sqrt{n}$  to  $\sqrt{n}$ , kernel thinning has the guarantee

$$
\mathrm {M M D} (\mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {K T}}) \stackrel {\prec} {_ {\mathbf {k}}} \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}} + \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}} \sqrt {\log (2 ^ {g} \sqrt {n}) \cdot \mathcal {M} _ {\mathbf {k}} (\mathcal {B} _ {2} (R) , \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}})} \sqrt {\log (1 / \delta)} + \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}} \sqrt {\log 2 ^ {g} \sqrt {n}} \log (1 / \delta),
$$

with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ , where  $\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathcal{A},\varepsilon)$  and  $R$  carry the same meaning as in Example 2. Thus, with probability at least  $1 - 2\delta$ , we have

$$
\operatorname {M M D} \left(S _ {\text {i n}}, S _ {\mathrm {K T - C P} + +}\right) \leq \operatorname {M M D} \left(S _ {\text {i n}}, S _ {\mathrm {K T - C P}}\right) + \operatorname {M M D} \left(S _ {\mathrm {K T - C P} + +}, S _ {\mathrm {K T - C P}}\right)
$$

Setting  $2^g = \log n$ , we get a bound of

$$
\mathrm {M M D} (\mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {S} _ {\mathrm {K T - C P + +}}) \stackrel {\prec} {\sim_ {\bf k}} 2 \Big (\sqrt {\log (\frac {n}{\delta})} + \log (\frac {n}{\delta}) \Big) \frac {1}{\sqrt {n}} \sqrt {\mathcal {M} _ {\bf k} (\mathcal {B} _ {2} (R) , \frac {1}{\sqrt {n} \log n})},
$$

On the other hand, with high probability the direct KT output of size  $\sqrt{n}$  satisfies  $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sqrt{\log n \cdot \mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathcal{B}_2(R), \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})}\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}$  where we note that this bound follows from (6) by substituting  $m$  such that  $n/2^m = 2^{\mathfrak{g}}\sqrt{n}$  (the output size). Comparing the bounds, we conclude that KT-COMPRESS provides a constant worse MMD error than KT itself for  $\mathbf{k}$ , and  $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{in}}$ , when  $\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathcal{B}_2(R), \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}) = \Theta(\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathcal{B}_2(R), \frac{1}{\sqrt{n\log n}}))$ . This condition is satisfied when  $\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathcal{B}_2(R), \varepsilon) \precsim_d R^d (\log(1/\varepsilon))^{\omega}$  for suitable  $\omega$ ; and Dwivedi & Mackey (2021a, Prop. 3) shows that this bound on covering number is valid for analytic kernels like Gaussian and inverse multiquadrics.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We now provide experiments (with additional experiments and supplementary details in App. L) that demonstrate the speed ups with minimal loss of error in several experiments. We compare KT and kernel herding with their COMPRESS and COMPRESS++ versions, and in all tasks we do root thinning, namely take  $n$  input points and compress it down to  $\sqrt{n}$  points. For COMPRESS++ we set  $\mathfrak{g} = 4$  in all experiments. We evaluate the procedures both in terms of MMD error (averaged across 10 runs), and runtime (averaged across 3 runs); the error bars are too small to be visible in almost all settings. All timing experiments were run on a single core of an Intel Xeon CPU with 32GB RAM.

Target distributions and experiment settings We consider three sets of target distributions: (a) Gaussian target  $\mathbb{P} = \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}_d)$  for  $d\in \{2,4,10,100\}$ , (b)  $M$ -Mixture of Gaussian target  $\mathbb{P} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j = 1}^{M}\mathcal{N}(\mu_j,\mathbf{I}_2)$  with  $M\in \{4,6,8,31\}$  with component means  $\mu_j\in \mathbb{R}^2$  defined in App. L, and (c) MCMC target for 12 different Bayesian posterior inference tasks with data taken from Riabiz et al. (2020a) and additional details provided in App. L. All our experiments are run with Gaussian kernel  $\mathbf{k}(x,y) = \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\| x - y\| _2^2\right)$  with  $\sigma^2$  set to 2d for (a), and (b), and chosen using median heuristic over the entire MCMC chain Garreau et al. (2017) for (c). For error performance, we evaluate the different thinning algorithms with respect to the MMD metric  $\mathrm{MMD_k}$  for (a) and (b) since it can be computed in closed-form, and for (c) since the posterior is intractable, we measure the quantity we bound namely  $\mathrm{MMD_k}(\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{in}},\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{out}})$  —the error between the input and output empirical distributions. For (a) and (b), the input sequence is generated i.i.d. from the target  $\mathbb{P}$ , and for (c) we first standard thin the chain to get  $n$  input points which is then fed to the different thinning algorithms (see App. L for details). For all error plots, we also provide the OLS fit on the log-log scale for the error and the input size, and its slope is shown as the empirical decay rate, e.g., a slope of  $-0.48$  for the best fit is labeled as  $n^{-0.48}$  for the corresponding algorithm.

Kernel thinning experiments We evaluate standard thinning (ST), kernel thinning (KT), KT-COMPRESS (denoted as KT-Comp), KT-COMPRESS++ (denoted as KT-Comp++) for all the settings (a), (b) and (c), and we present the results in Figs. 1, 2, and 6 respectively. We note that standard thinning provides close to the Monte Carlo rate of  $n^{-\frac{1}{4}}$  with  $n^{\frac{1}{2}}$  points in almost all the experiments,

while KT and its COMPRESS++ variants provide the best performance often achieving the  $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$  rate as guaranteed by our theory in moderate dimensions. The runtimes for the procedures are compared in Fig. 1 where we note that COMPRESS++ provides a noticeable 10-25x speed up over the KT runtime (and compress even more), consistent with our theoretical guarantees. In fact, the faster runtime of COMPRESS and COMPRESS++ allowed us to run experiments with them to a significantly larger input size for which we KT took many days to finish a single run (and thereby was not run).

Kernel herding experiments As another demonstration of the practical advantages of COMPRESS and COMPRESS++, we apply these procedures with kernel herding Chen et al. (2010) for Gaussian and MoG targets and report the results in Figs. 3 and 7. The results are labeled as kernel herding (Herd), COMPRESS herding (Herd-Comp), and COMPRESS++ with herding (Herd-Comp++) In all cases, we observe that Herd-Comp++ provides a competitive performance to herding, sometimes improving upon it. Fig. 3 shows COMPRESS++ with herding is  $10 - 60\mathrm{x}$  faster than herding for large samples sizes thereby providing further evidence about the compatibility of our meta procedures with generic thinning procedures, and their practical impact on saving computation time with minimal loss in accuracy.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In this paper, we introduce an easy to implement and versatile meta-algorithms to speed up distribution compression tasks at almost no cost to the error guarantees. We have demonstrated, both theoretically and empirically that the performance on benchmark task are comparable to that of previous work. Furthermore, we have shown that these meta-algorithms even work well in practice with algorithms that don't have theoretical guarantees but work well in practice e.g. herding. Analyzing the behavior of these meta-algorithms in other compression setting is an interesting direction for future work.
