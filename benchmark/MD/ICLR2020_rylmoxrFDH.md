# ABSTRACT

The training of stochastic neural network models with binary  $(\pm 1)$  weights and activations via continuous surrogate networks is investigated. We derive, using mean field theory, a set of scalar equations describing how input signals propagate through surrogate networks. The equations reveal that depending on the choice of surrogate model, the networks may or may not exhibit an order to chaos transition, and the presence of depth scales that limit the maximum trainable depth. Specifically, in solving the equations for edge of chaos conditions, we show that surrogates derived using the Gaussian local reparameterisation trick have no critical initialisation, whereas a deterministic surrogates based on analytic Gaussian integration do. The theory is applied to a range of binary neuron and weight design choices, such as different neuron noise models, allowing the categorisation of algorithms in terms of their behaviour at initialisation. Moreover, we predict theoretically and confirm numerically, that common weight initialization schemes used in standard continuous networks, when applied to the mean values of the stochastic binary weights, yield poor training performance. This study shows that, contrary to common intuition, the means of the stochastic binary weights should be initialised close to close to  $\pm 1$  for deeper networks to be trainable.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Recent work in deep learning has used a mean field formalism to explain the empirically well known impact of initialization on the dynamics of learning Saxe et al. (2013), Poole et al. (2016), Schoenholz et al. (2016). From one perspective Poole et al. (2016), Schoenholz et al. (2016), the formalism studies how signals propagate forward and backward in wide, random neural networks, by measuring how the variance and correlation of input signals evolve from layer to layer, knowing the distributions of the weights and biases of the network. By studying these moments the authors in Schoenholz et al. (2016) were able to explain how heuristic initialization schemes avoid the "vanishing and exploding gradients problem" Glorot & Bengio (2010), establishing that for neural networks of arbitrary depth to be trainable they must be initialized at "criticality", which corresponds to initial correlation being preserved to any depth. Practically, this line of work provides maximum trainable depth scales, as well as insight into how different initialization schemes will affect the speed of learning at the initial stages of training.

In this paper we extend this mean field formalism to two binary neural network approximations Soudry et al. (2014), Shayer et al. (2017), each of which acts as a smooth surrogate model suitable for the application of continuous optimization techniques. The problem of learning when the activations and weights of a neural network are of low precision has seen renewed interest in recent years, in part due to the promise of on-chip learning and the deployment of low-power applications Courbariaux & Bengio (2016). Recent work has opted to train discrete variable networks directly via backpropagation on a differentiable surrogate network, thus leveraging automatic differentiation libraries and GPUs. A key to this approach is in defining an appropriate surrogate network as an approximation to the discrete model, and various algorithms have been proposed Baldassi et al. (2018), Soudry et al. (2014), Courbariaux & Bengio (2016), Shayer et al. (2017).

Unfortunately, comparisons are difficult to make, since different algorithms may perform better under specific combinations of optimisation algorithms, initialisations, and heuristics such as drop out and batch normalization. Therefore a theoretical understanding of the various components of

the algorithms is desirable. To date, the initialisation of any binary neural network algorithm has not been studied, although the affect of quantization levels has been explored through this perspective Blumenfeld et al. (2019). Since all approximations still retain the basic neural network structure of layerwise processing, crucially applying backpropagation for optimisation, it is reasonable to expect that signal propagation will also be an important concept for these methods.

The two continuous surrogate models of binary networks that we study make use of the application of the central limit theorem (CLT) at the receptive fields of each neuron, assuming the binary weights are stochastic. Specifically, the fields are written in terms of the continuous means of stochastic binary weights, but with more complicated expressions than for standard continuous networks. The first approximation, presented in Soudry et al. (2014), and studied in the case of the perceptron in Baldassi et al. (2018), yields a deterministic surrogate via analytic integration. The ideas behind the approximation are old Spiegelhalter & Lauritzen (1990) but have seen renewed use in the current context from Bayesian Ribeiro & Opper (2011) Hernández-Lobato & Adams (2015) and non-Bayesian perspectives Soudry et al. (2014). The second approximation is based on the so called "local reparameterisation trick", which combines Monte Carlo sampling with the CLT to yield a differentiable network Shayer et al. (2017), Peters & Welling (2018). Note that the algorithm presented in Shayer et al. (2017) did not consider binary neurons, which we show here to severely limit this approach.

Our contribution is to successfully apply, in the spirit of Poole et al. (2016), a second level of mean field theory to analyse two surrogate models. The application of this mean field theory hinges on the use of self-averaging arguments Mezard et al. (1987). We demonstrate via simulation that the recursive equations derived for signal propagation accurately describe the behaviour of randomly initialised networks. Unlike standard continuous networks, it is not always the case that a binary neural network will have an edge of chaos (EOC). Therefore, for each surrogate, we attempt to solve the equations for this condition. As we will see, in the case that both neurons and weights are stochastic and binary (the most difficult case), we will see that an EOC exists for deterministic surrogate, while it does not exist for the reparameterisation trick based surrogate. We explore other choices or combinations of binary weights and neurons as well.

In the case that critical initialisations exist, we are also able to derive the depth scales that limit the maximum trainable depth, similarly to Schoenholz et al. (2016). These scales increase as the networks are initialised closer to criticality, similarly to standard neural networks. In the stochastic binary weight models, initialising close to criticality corresponds to the means of the weights being initialised with strongly broken symmetry, close to  $\pm 1$ . Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that trainability is indeed delivered with this initialisation, making it possible to train deeper binary neural networks.

We also discuss the equivalent perspective to signal propagation, as first established in Saxe et al. (2013), that we are effectively studying how to control the singular value distribution of the input-output Jacobian matrix of the neural network Pennington et al. (2017) Pennington et al. (2018), specifically its mean. While for standard continuous neural networks the mean squared singular value of the Jacobian is directly related to the derivative of the correlation recursion equation, in the surrogates studied here this is not so. We show that in this case the derivative calculated is only an approximation of the Jacobian mean squared singular value, but that the approximation error approaches zero as the layer width goes to infinity. We consider the possibilities in pursuing this line of work, and other important questions, in the discussion.

# 2 BACKGROUND

# 2.1 CONTINUOUS NEURAL NETWORKS AND APPROXIMATIONSTO BINARY NETWORKS

A neural network model is typically defined as a deterministic non-linear function. We consider a fully connected feedforward model, which is composed of  $N^{\ell} \times N^{\ell - 1}$  weight matrices  $W^{\ell}$  and bias vectors  $b^{\ell}$  in each layer  $\ell \in \{0, \dots, L\}$ , with elements  $W_{ij}^{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}$  and  $b_i^\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ . Given an input vector  $x^0 \in \mathbb{R}^{N_0}$ , the network is defined in terms of the following vector equations,

$$
x ^ {\ell} = \phi^ {\ell} \left(h _ {\mathrm {c t s}} ^ {\ell}\right), \quad h _ {\mathrm {c t s}} ^ {\ell} = W ^ {\ell} x ^ {\ell - 1} + b ^ {\ell} \tag {1}
$$

where the pointwise non-linearity is, for example,  $\phi^{\ell}(\cdot) = \tanh (\cdot)$ . We refer to the input to a neuron, such as  $h_{\mathrm{cts}}^{\ell}$ , as the pre-activation field.

In the binary neural networks we study, we instead consider stochastic binary weight matrices and neurons. The idea is to leverage this stochasticity in deriving continuous surrogates. We denote the matrices as  $\mathbf{S}^{\ell}$  with all weights $^1$ $\mathbf{S}_{ij}^{\ell} \in \{\pm 1\}$  being independently sampled Bernoulli variables:  $\mathbf{S}_{ij}^{\ell} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(M_{ij}^{\ell})$ , where the probability of flipping is controlled by the mean  $M_{ij}^{\ell} \coloneqq \mathbb{E}\mathbf{S}_{ij}^{\ell}$ . The neurons in this model are also Bernoulli variables, controlled by the incoming field  $\mathbf{h}_{\mathrm{SB}}^{\ell} = \mathbf{S}^{\ell}\mathbf{x}^{\ell - 1} + b^{\ell}$  (SB denoting "stochastic binary"). The idea behind several recent papers Soudry et al. (2014) Baldassi et al. (2018), Shayer et al. (2017), Peters & Welling (2018) is to adapt the mean of the Bernoulli weights, with the stochastic model essentially used to "smooth out" the discrete variables and arrive at a differentiable function, open to the application of continuous optimisation techniques.

The algorithms we study here take the limit of large layer width to model the field  $\mathbf{h}_{\mathrm{SB}}^{\ell}$  as a Gaussian, with mean  $\bar{h}_i^\ell \coloneqq \sum_j M_{ij}^\ell x_j^{\ell -1} + b_i^\ell$  and variance  $\Sigma_{ii}^{\ell} = \sum_{j}1 - (M_{ij}^{\ell}x_{j}^{\ell -1})^{2}$ . This is the first level of mean field theory, which we can apply successively from layer to layer by propagating means and variances to eventually obtain a differentiable function of the  $M_{ij}^{\ell}$ .

Briefly, the deterministic surrogate of Soudry et al. (2014) and Baldassi et al. (2018) can be derived as follows. For a finite dataset  $\mathcal{D} = \{x_{\mu},y_{\mu}\}$ , with  $y_{\mu}$  the label, we define a cost via

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D}} (f; M, b) = \sum_ {\mu \in \mathcal {D}} \log \mathbb {E} _ {\mathbf {S}, \mathbf {x}} [ p (y _ {\mu} = f (x _ {\mu}; \mathbf {S}, b, \mathbf {x})) ] \tag {2}
$$

with the expectation  $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{S},\mathbf{x}}[\cdot ]$  over all weights and neurons. This objective might also be recognised as a marginal likelihood, and so it is reasonable to describe this method as Type II maximum likelihood, or empirical Bayes. In any case, it is possible to take the expectation via approximate analytic integration, leaving us with a completely deterministic neural network with, for example,  $\tanh (\cdot)$  non-linearities, but with more complicated pre-activation fields than a standard neural network.

The starting point for this approximation comes from rewriting the expectation  $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{S},\mathbf{x}}\big[p(y_{\mu} = f(x_{\mu};\mathbf{S},b,\mathbf{x}))\big]$  in terms of nested conditional expectations, similarly to a Markov chain, with layers corresponding to time indices,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {\mathbf {S}, \mathbf {x}} [ p (y _ {\mu} = f (x _ {\mu}; \mathbf {S}, b, \mathbf {x})) ] = \sum_ {\mathbf {S} ^ {\ell}, \mathbf {x} ^ {\ell} \forall \ell} p (y _ {\mu} = f (x _ {\mu}; \mathbf {S}, b, \mathbf {x})) p (\mathbf {x} ^ {\ell} | \mathbf {x} ^ {\ell - 1}, \mathbf {S} ^ {\ell}) p (\mathbf {S} ^ {\ell}) \\ = \sum_ {\mathbf {S} ^ {L + 1}} p \left(y _ {\mu} = \mathbf {S} ^ {L + 1} \mathbf {x} ^ {L} + b ^ {L} \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {L}\right) \prod_ {\ell = 0} ^ {L - 1} \sum_ {\mathbf {x} ^ {\ell}} \sum_ {\mathbf {S} ^ {\ell}} p \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {\ell + 1} \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\ell}, \mathbf {S} ^ {\ell}\right) p \left(\mathbf {S} ^ {\ell}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

with the distribution of neurons factorising across the layer, given the previous layer,  $p(\mathbf{x}^{\ell + 1}|\mathbf{x}^{\ell}) = \prod_{i}p(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\ell + 1}|\mathbf{x}^{\ell},\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\ell})$ . The basic idea is to successively marginalise over the stochastic inputs to each neuron, calculating an approximation of each neuron's probability distribution,  $\hat{p} (\mathbf{x}_i^\ell)$ . The approximation is based on the well known Gaussian integral of the Gaussian cumulative distribution function<sup>2</sup>, see the appendices for details. The steps of the approximation can be written for illustration as,

$$
\begin{array}{l} p (\mathbf {x} _ {i} ^ {\ell}) = \sum_ {\mathbf {x} ^ {\ell - 1}} \sum_ {\mathbf {S} ^ {\ell}} p (\mathbf {x} _ {i} ^ {\ell} | \mathbf {x} ^ {\ell - 1}, \mathbf {S} ^ {\ell}) p (\mathbf {S} ^ {\ell - 1}) \hat {p} (\mathbf {x} ^ {\ell}) \approx \int_ {h _ {i} ^ {\ell}} \sigma (\mathbf {h} _ {i} ^ {\ell} \mathbf {x} _ {i} ^ {\ell + 1}) \mathcal {N} (\mathbf {h} _ {i} ^ {\ell} | \bar {h} _ {i} ^ {\ell}, (\Sigma_ {M F} ^ {\ell}) _ {i i}) \\ \approx \sigma \left(\kappa \frac {\bar {h} _ {i} ^ {\ell}}{\left(1 + \Sigma_ {M F} ^ {\ell}\right) _ {i i} ^ {1 / 2}} \mathbf {x} _ {i} ^ {\ell}\right) := \hat {p} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {i} ^ {\ell}\right) \tag {3} \\ \end{array}
$$

with  $\kappa$  a constant of the integration, approximate or exact. The sigmoidal function  $\sigma(\cdot)$  is typically cumulative distribution function of either the Gaussian, or the logistic distribution. We discuss this in more detail shortly, since it determines the form of the neuron non-linearity.

The term  $\Sigma_{MF}$  is the mean field approximation to the covariance between the stochastic binary pre-activations,

$$
\left(\Sigma_ {M F}\right) _ {i j} = C o v \left(\mathbf {h} _ {\mathrm {S B}} ^ {\ell}, \mathbf {h} _ {\mathrm {S B}} ^ {\ell}\right) _ {i j} \delta_ {i j} \tag {4}
$$

that is, a diagonal approximation to the full covariance  $(\delta_{ij}$  is the Kronecker delta). This approximate probability is then used as part of the Gaussian CLT applied at the next layer. Importantly, we can write out the network forward equations analogously to the continuous case,

$$
x _ {i} ^ {\ell} = \phi^ {\ell} (\kappa h ^ {\ell}), \quad h ^ {\ell} = \Sigma_ {M F} ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \bar {h} ^ {\ell}, \quad \bar {h} ^ {\ell} = M ^ {\ell} x ^ {\ell - 1} + b ^ {\ell} \tag {5}
$$

We note that the backpropagation algorithm derived in Soudry et al. (2014) was derived from a Bayesian message passing scheme, but removes all cavity arguments without corrections. As we have shown this algorithm is easier to derive from an empirical Bayes or maximum marginal likelihood formulation. Furthermore, in Soudry et al. (2014) the authors chose not to "backpropagate through" the variance terms, based on Taylor approximation and large layer width arguments.

The authors of Shayer et al. (2017), Peters & Welling (2018) utilise instead the local reparameterisation trick Kingma & Welling (2013) to obtain differentiable networks. The basic idea here is to rewrite the incoming field  $\mathbf{h} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$  as  $\mathbf{h} = \mu + \sigma \epsilon$  where  $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ . Thus any expectation over  $h$  can be written instead as an expectation over  $\epsilon$ . The resulting networks are thus differentiable (with respect to the means and variances forming each Gaussian), albeit not deterministic. The forward propagation equations for this surrogate are

$$
x _ {i} ^ {\ell} = \phi^ {\ell} \left(h ^ {\ell}\right), \quad h ^ {\ell} = \bar {h} ^ {\ell} + \epsilon^ {\ell} \Sigma_ {M F} ^ {- \frac {1}{2}}, \quad \bar {h} ^ {\ell} = M ^ {\ell} x ^ {\ell - 1} + b ^ {\ell} \tag {6}
$$

Given the either the approximately analytically integrated loss function, or the reparameterisation trick based surrogate, it is possible to perform gradient descent with respect to the  $M_{ij}^{\ell}$  and  $b_{i}^{\ell}$ .

In the next section move on to a second level of mean field, in order to study how a signal propagates on average in these continuous models, given random initialisation of the  $M^{\ell}$  and  $b^{\ell}$ . This is analogous to the approach of Poole et al. (2016) who studied random  $W^{\ell}$  and  $b^{\ell}$  in the standard continuous case. The motivation for considering this perspective is that, despite having a very different pre-activation fields, the surrogate models still maintain the same basic architecture, as seen clearly from the equations equation 31 and equation 6. Therefore, the surrogates are likely to inherit the same "training problems" of standard neural networks, such as the vanishing and exploding gradient problems Glorot & Bengio (2010). Since the dynamic mean field theory of Poole et al. (2016) provides a compelling explanation of the dynamics of the early stages of learning, via signal propagation, it is worthwhile to see if this theory can be extended to the non-standard network definitions.

# 2.1.1 A NOTE ON THE NON-LINEARITY  $\phi(\cdot)$  AND NEURON NOISE MODELS

The form of each neuron's probability distribution,  $\sigma(\cdot)$  in Equation equation 3 depends on the underlying noise model. We can express a Bernoulli random variable  $\mathbf{S} \in \{\pm 1\}$  with  $\mathbf{S} \sim p(\mathbf{S}; \theta)$  via its latent variable formulation  $\mathbf{S} = \mathrm{sign}(\theta + \alpha \mathbf{L})$ . In this form  $\theta$  is referred to as a "natural" parameter, and the term  $\mathbf{L}$  is a latent random noise, which determines the form of the probability distribution  $\sigma(\cdot)$ . In turn, this determines the form of the non-linearity since  $\phi(\cdot) = 2\sigma(\cdot) - 1$ . In general the form of  $\phi(\cdot)$  will impact on the surrogates' performance, including within and beyond the mean field description presented here. However, a result following from the analysis in the next section is that choosing a deterministic binary neuron, i.e. the  $\mathrm{sign}(\cdot)$  function, or a stochastic binary neuron, reduces to the same propagation equations, up to a scaling constant.

# 2.2 FORWARD SIGNAL PROPAGATION FOR STANDARD CONTINUOUS NETWORKS

We first recount the formalism developed in Poole et al. (2016). Assume the weights of a standard continuous network are initialised with  $W_{ij}^{\ell} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_w^2)$ , biases  $b^{\ell} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_b^2)$ , and input signal

$x_{a}^{0}$  has zero mean  $\mathbb{E}x^0 = 0$  and variance  $\mathbb{E}[x_a^0\cdot x_a^0 ] = q_{aa}^0$ , and with  $a$  denoting a particular input pattern. As before, the signal propagates via equation equation 1 from layer to layer.

The particular mean field approximation used here replaces each element in the pre-activation field  $h_i^\ell$  by a Gaussian random variable whose moments are matched. So we are interested in computing, from layer to layer, the variance  $q_{aa}^\ell = \frac{1}{N_\ell}\sum_i(h_{i;a}^\ell)^2$  from a particular input  $x_a^0$ , and also the covariance between the pre-activations  $q_{ab}^\ell = \frac{1}{N_\ell}\sum_ih_{i;a}^\ell h_{i;b}^\ell$ , arising from two different inputs  $x_a^0$  and  $x_b^0$  with given covariance  $q_{ab}^0$ . As explained in Poole et al. (2016), assuming the independence within a layer;  $\mathbb{E}h_{i;a}^{\ell}h_{j;a}^{\ell} = q_{aa}^{\ell}\delta_{ij}$  and  $\mathbb{E}h_{i;a}^{\ell}h_{j;b}^{\ell} = q_{ab}^{\ell}\delta_{ij}$ , it is possible to derive recurrence relations from layer to layer

$$
q _ {a a} ^ {\ell} = \sigma_ {w} ^ {2} \int D z \phi^ {2} \left(\sqrt {q _ {a a} ^ {\ell - 1}} z\right) + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2} := \sigma_ {w} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j, a} ^ {\ell - 1}\right) + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2} \tag {7}
$$

with  $Dz = \frac{dz}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}}$  the standard Gaussian measure. The recursion for the covariance is given by

$$
q _ {a b} ^ {\ell} = \sigma_ {w} ^ {2} \int D z _ {1} D z _ {2} \phi (u _ {a}) \phi (u _ {b}) + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2} := \sigma_ {w} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \left[ \phi \left(h _ {j, a} ^ {\ell - 1}\right) \phi \left(h _ {j, b} ^ {\ell - 1}\right) \right] + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2} \tag {8}
$$

where

$$
u _ {a} = \sqrt {q _ {a a} ^ {\ell - 1}} z _ {1}, u _ {b} = \sqrt {q _ {b b} ^ {\ell - 1}} \left(c _ {a b} ^ {\ell - 1} z _ {1} + \sqrt {1 - (c _ {a b} ^ {\ell - 1}) ^ {2}} z _ {2}\right)
$$

and we identify  $c_{ab}^{\ell}$  as the correlation in layer  $\ell$ . Arguably the most important quantity is the the slope of the correlation recursion equation or mapping from layer to layer, denoted as  $\chi$ , which is given by:

$$
\chi = \frac {\partial c _ {a b} ^ {\ell}}{\partial c _ {a b} ^ {\ell - 1}} = \sigma_ {w} ^ {2} \int D z _ {1} D z _ {2} \phi^ {\prime} (u _ {a}) \phi^ {\prime} (u _ {b}) \tag {9}
$$

As discussed Poole et al. (2016), when  $\chi_{c^*} = 1$  the system is at a critical point where correlations can propagate to arbitrary depth, corresponding to the edge of chaos. In continuous networks,  $\chi$  is equivalent to the mean square singular value of the Jacobian matrix for a single layer  $J_{ij} = \frac{\partial h_i^\ell}{\partial h_j^{\ell - 1}}$ , as explained in Poole et al. (2016). Therefore controlling  $\chi$  will prevent the gradients from either vanishing or growing exponentially with depth.

In Schoenholz et al. (2016) explicit depth scales for standard neural networks are derived, which diverge corresponding when  $\chi_{c^*} = 1$ , thus providing the bounds on maximum trainable depth. We will not rewrite these continuous depth scales, since these resemble those in this case with which we now proceed.

# 3 THEORETICAL RESULTS FOR DETERMINISTIC SURROGATES

# 3.1 FORWARD SIGNAL PROPAGATION

For the deterministic surrogate model we assume means initialised from some bounded distribution  $M_{ij}^{\ell} \sim P(\mathcal{M} = M_{ij})$ , with mean zero and variance of the means g?iven by  $\sigma_m^2$ . For instance, a valid distribution could be a clipped Gaussian $^3$ , or another Bernoulli, for example  $P(\mathcal{M}) = \frac{1}{2}\delta (\mathcal{M} = +\sigma_m) + \frac{1}{2}\delta (\mathcal{M} = -\sigma_m)$ , whose variance is  $\sigma_m^2$ . The biases are distributed as  $b^{\ell} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,N_{\ell -1}\sigma_b^2)$ , with the variance scaled by the previous layer width  $N^{\ell -1}$  since the denominator of the pre-activation scales with  $N^{\ell -1}$  as seen from the definition equation 31. Once again we have input signal  $x_a^0$ , with zero mean  $\mathbb{E}x^{0} = 0$ , and with a denoting a particular input pattern. Assume we have a binary neuron averaged appropriately, such that its mean  $\bar{x}_i^\ell \coloneqq \mathbb{E}_{p(x_i)}x_i^\ell = \phi (h_i^{\ell -1})$ , where the field is given by:

$$
h _ {i} ^ {\ell} = \frac {\sum_ {j} M _ {i j} ^ {\ell} \phi \left(h _ {i} ^ {\ell - 1}\right) + b _ {i} ^ {\ell}}{\sqrt {\sum_ {j} \left[ 1 - \left(M _ {i j} ^ {\ell}\right) ^ {2} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {i} ^ {\ell - 1}\right) \right]}} \tag {10}
$$

which we can read from the vector equation equation 31. Note that this corresponds to the deterministic sign  $(\cdot)$  neuron case. We actually show in Appendix B that the stochastic and deterministic binary neuron cases reduce to the same signal propagation equations.

As in the continuous case we are interested in computing the variance  $q_{aa}^{\ell} = \frac{1}{N\ell}\sum_{i}(h_{i;a}^{\ell})^{2}$  and covariance  $\mathbb{E}h_{i;a}^{\ell}h_{j;b}^{\ell} = q_{ab}^{\ell}\delta_{ij}$ , via recursive formulae. The key to the derivation is recognising that the denominator is a self-averaging quantity,

$$
\lim  _ {N \rightarrow \infty} \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {j} 1 - \left(M _ {i j} ^ {\ell}\right) ^ {2} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {i} ^ {\ell - 1}\right) = 1 - \mathbb {E} \left[\left(M _ {i j} ^ {\ell}\right) ^ {2} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {i} ^ {\ell - 1}\right)\right] = 1 - \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j, a} ^ {l - 1}\right) \tag {11}
$$

where we have used the properties that the  $M_{ij}^{\ell}$  and  $h_i^{\ell - 1}$  are each i.i.d. random variables at initialisation, and independent Mezard et al. (1987). Following this self-averaging argument, we can take expectations more readily as shown in the appendices, finding the variance recursion

$$
q _ {a a} ^ {\ell} = \frac {\sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1}\right) + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}}{1 - \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1}\right)} \tag {12}
$$

and then based on this expression for  $q_{aa}^{\ell}$ , and assuming  $q_{aa} = q_{bb}$ , the correlation recursion can be written as

$$
c _ {a b} ^ {\ell} = \frac {1 + q _ {a a} ^ {\ell}}{q _ {a a} ^ {\ell}} \frac {\sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \phi \left(h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1}\right) \phi \left(h _ {j , b} ^ {l - 1}\right) + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}}{1 + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}} \tag {13}
$$

The slope of the correlation mapping from layer to layer, when the normalized length of each input is at its fixed point  $q_{aa}^{\ell} = q_{bb}^{\ell} = q^{*}(\sigma_{m},\sigma_{b})$ , denoted as  $\chi$ , is given by:

$$
\chi = \frac {\partial c _ {a b} ^ {\ell}}{\partial c _ {a b} ^ {\ell - 1}} = \frac {1 + q ^ {*}}{1 + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \int D z _ {1} D z _ {2} \phi^ {\prime} (u _ {a}) \phi^ {\prime} (u _ {b}) \tag {14}
$$

where  $u_{a}$  and  $u_{b}$  are defined exactly as in the continuous case. Refer to the appendices for full details of the derivation.

# 3.2 EDGE OF CHAOS CONDITIONS

The edge of chaos in the hyper-parameter space  $(\sigma_b^2, \sigma_m^2)$ , for the dynamical equations of the network, is determined as being the condition  $\chi_1 = 1$ , since this determines the stability of the correlation map fixed point  $c^* = 1$ . Note that for the deterministic surrogate this is always a fixed point. Following the straightforward arguments in Hayou et al. (2019) we take  $\chi_1 = 1$  we can rearrange for  $\sigma_m^2$ ,

$$
\chi_ {1} = \frac {\sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(\phi^ {\prime} (\sqrt {q ^ {*}} z)\right) ^ {2} \right]}{1 - \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \left[ \phi^ {2} (\sqrt {q ^ {*}} z) \right]} = 1 \Longrightarrow \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{\mathbb {E} \left[ \left(\phi^ {\prime} (\sqrt {q ^ {*}} z)\right) ^ {2} \right] + \mathbb {E} \left[ \phi^ {2} (\sqrt {q ^ {*}} z) \right]} \tag {15}
$$

We can then substitute this into the expression for the variance map,

$$
q _ {a a} ^ {\ell} = \sigma_ {b} ^ {2} + \left(\sigma_ {b} ^ {2} + 1\right) \frac {\mathbb {E} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1}\right)}{\mathbb {E} \left[ \left(\phi^ {\prime} (\sqrt {q ^ {*}} z)\right) ^ {2} \right]} \tag {16}

Thus, in order to find the edge of chaos, as a function of the parameters  $\sigma_{m}^{2}$  and  $\sigma_{b}^{2}$ , one must simply find a value of  $\sigma_{b}^{2}$  which satisfies the variance map. We solve this numerically, as shown in Figure 4, for different neuron noise models and hence non-linearities  $\phi(\cdot)$ . We find that the edge of chaos for all these design choices is close to the point  $(\sigma_{m}^{2}, \sigma_{b}^{2}) = (1,0)$ . However, it is not just the singleton point, as for example in Hayou et al. (2019) for the ReLu case. We plot these edges of chaos in Appendix

# 3.3 ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS AND DEPTH SCALES

In the continuous case, when  $\chi$  approaches 1, we approach criticality and the rate of convergence to any fixed point slows. The depth scales, as derived in Schoenholz et al. (2016) provide a quantitative indicator to the number of layers correlations will survive for, and thus how trainable a network is. We show here that similar depth scales can be derived for these deterministic surrogates. According to Schoenholz et al. (2016) it should hold asymptotically that  $|q_{aa}^{\ell} - q^{*}| \sim \exp(-\frac{\ell}{\xi_q})$  and  $|c_{ab}^{\ell} - c^{*}| \sim \exp(-\frac{\ell}{\xi_c})$  for sufficiently large  $\ell$  (the network depth), where  $\xi_q$  and  $\xi_c$  define the depth scales over which the variance and correlations of signals may propagate. Writing  $q_{aa}^{\ell} = q^{*} + \epsilon^{\ell}$ , we can show that:

$$
\epsilon^ {\ell + 1} = \frac {\epsilon^ {\ell}}{1 + q ^ {*}} \left[ \chi_ {1} + \frac {1 + q ^ {*}}{1 + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {w} ^ {2} \int D z \phi^ {\prime \prime} \left(\sqrt {q ^ {*}} z\right) \phi \left(\sqrt {q ^ {*}} z\right) \right] + \mathcal {O} \left(\left(\epsilon^ {\ell}\right) ^ {2}\right) \tag {17}
$$

We can similarly expand for the correlation  $c_{ab}^{\ell} = c^{*} + \epsilon^{\ell}$ , and if we assume  $q_{aa}^{\ell} = q^{*}$ , we can write

$$
\epsilon^ {\ell + 1} = \epsilon^ {\ell} \left[ \frac {1 + q ^ {*}}{1 + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \int D z \phi^ {\prime} \left(u _ {1}\right) \phi^ {\prime} \left(u _ {2}\right) \right] + \mathcal {O} \left(\left(\epsilon^ {\ell}\right) ^ {2}\right) \tag {18}
$$

The depth scales we are interested in are given by the log ratio  $\log \frac{\epsilon^{\ell + 1}}{\epsilon^{\ell}}$ . As discussed in Schoenholz et al. (2016), we are most interested in the correlation depth scale,

$$
\xi_ {c} ^ {- 1} = - \log \left[ \frac {1 + q ^ {*}}{1 + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \int D z \phi^ {\prime} (u _ {1}) \phi^ {\prime} (u _ {2}) \right] = - \log \chi \tag {19}
$$

The arguments used in the original derivation Schoenholz et al. (2016) carry over to this case in a straightforward manner, albeit with more tedious algebra.

# 4 THEORETICAL RESULTS FOR REPARAMETERIZATION TRICK SURROGATES

# 4.1 FORWARD SIGNAL PROPAGATION

The pre-activation field for the perturbed surrogate with both stochastic binary weights and neurons is given by,

$$
h _ {i, a} ^ {l} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {N}} \sum_ {j} M _ {i j} ^ {l} \phi \left(h _ {j, a} ^ {l - 1}\right) + b _ {i} ^ {l} + \epsilon_ {i, a} ^ {\ell} \frac {1}{\sqrt {N}} \sqrt {\sum_ {j} 1 - \left(M _ {i j} ^ {l}\right) ^ {2} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1}\right)} \tag {20}
$$

where we recall that  $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . The non-linearity  $\phi(\cdot)$  can of course be derived from any valid binary Bernoulli neuron model. Appealing to the same self-averaging arguments used in the previous section, we find the variance map to be

$$
\begin{array}{l} q _ {a a} ^ {\ell} = \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(h _ {i, a} ^ {l}\right) ^ {2} \right] = \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(\frac {1}{\sqrt {N}} \sum_ {j} m _ {i j} ^ {l} \phi \left(h _ {j, a} ^ {l - 1}\right) + b _ {i} ^ {l} + \frac {1}{\sqrt {N}} \epsilon_ {i, a} ^ {\ell} \sqrt {\sum_ {j} 1 - \left(m _ {i j} ^ {l}\right) ^ {2} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1}\right)}\right) ^ {2} \right] (21) \\ = \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j, a} ^ {l - 1}\right) + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2} + \left(1 - \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j, a} ^ {l - 1}\right)\right) = 1 + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2} (22) \\ \end{array}
$$

Interestingly, we see that the variance map does not depend on the variance of the means of the binary weights. This is a counter intuitive result, not immediately obvious from the pre-activation field definition. In the covariance map however, we do not have such simplification, since the perturbation  $\epsilon_{i,a}$  in uncorrelated between inputs  $a$  and  $b$ , thus we recover Equation equation 8 similarly for the standard continuous case. Thus the correlation map is given by

$$
c _ {a b} ^ {l} = \frac {\sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \phi \left(h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1}\right) \phi \left(h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1}\right) + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}}{1 + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}} \tag {23}
$$

# 4.2 EDGE OF CHAOS CONDITIONS

For an edge of chaos to exist, we of course require that  $c^* = 1$  to be a fixed point, as well as for the system to be marginally stable,  $\chi_1 = 1$ . Here we argue that these conditions cannot be met simultaneously. Specifically, from the correlation map we have a fixed point  $c^* = 1$  if and only if

$$
\sigma_ {m} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{\mathbb {E} \left[ \phi^ {2} \left(h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1}\right) \right]} \tag {24}
$$

However, for any valid function  $\phi(z)$ , the expectation  $\mathbb{E}[\phi^2(z)] \leq 1$ . For example, consider  $\phi(z) = \tanh(\kappa z)$  for any finite  $\kappa$ . This means that  $c^* = 1$  can not be a fixed point, and thus there is no edge of chaos for this model. Of course, as  $\kappa \to \infty$ , and  $\phi(z)$  becomes the sign  $(z)$  function,  $c^* = 1$  is in fact always a fixed point, however the sign  $(z)$  function does not have a derivative defined appropriately for a gradient descent procedure.

Likewise, since we have for  $\chi$  the same expression as Equation equation 9, then considering the condition  $\chi_{1} = 1$ , we find

$$
\sigma_ {m} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{\mathbb {E} [ (\phi^ {\prime} (h _ {j , a} ^ {l - 1})) ^ {2} ]} \tag {25}
$$

this expression cannot be satisfied unless  $\phi(z)$ , which is bounded between  $\pm 1$ , has derivative identically equal to one (recall the preactivations are assumed to be zero mean Gaussian). Thus, neither condition can be met and there is no edge of chaos. In the appendices we include the case of continuous neurons and binary weights, where an edge does exist.

# 5 NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

# 5.1 SIMULATIONS

We now move on to simulations of random networks, of the deterministic surrogate. In the appendices we present results for the reparameterisation trick based surrogate, but for the remainder of the paper we focus on the approximation which has an edge of chaos. We first verify that the theory accurately predicts the average behaviour of randomly initialised networks. In Figure 1 we see that the average behaviour of random networks are well predicted by the mean field theory. The estimates of the variance and correlation from simulations of random neural networks provided some input signals are plotted. The dotted lines correspond to empirical means, the shaded area corresponds to one standard deviation, and solid lines are the theoretical prediction. We see strong agreement in both the variance and correlation plots. In Appendix D we present the variance and correlation depth scales as a function of  $\sigma_{m}$ , and different curves corresponding to different bias variance values  $\sigma_{b}$ .

# 5.2 TRAINING PERFORMANCE FOR DIFFERENT MEAN INITIALISATION  $\sigma_{m}^{2}$

Here we test experimentally the predictions of the mean field theory by training networks to overfit a dataset in the supervised learning setting, having arbitrary depth and different initialisations. We consider first the performance of the deterministic surrogate, not its corresponding binary network.

![](images/b00287375136723d33a5713152644b590e0ac87e50217b544cd2647449e53142.jpg)  
Figure 2: Training performance of the continuous surrogate network, for different depth (in steps of 5 layers, up to  $L = 70$ ), against the variance of the means  $\sigma_{m}^{2}$ . Overlaid is a curve proportional to the correlation depth scale.

We use the MNIST dataset with reduced training set size  $(25\%)$  and record the training performance (percentage of the training set correctly labeled) after 20 epochs of gradient descent over the training set, for various network depths  $L < 70$  and different mean variances  $\sigma_{m}^{2}\in [0,1)$ . The optimizer used was Adam Kingma & Ba (2014) with learning rate of  $2\times 10^{-4}$  chosen after simple grid search, and a batch size of 64.

We see that the experimental results match the correlation depth scale derived, with a similar proportion to the standard continuous case of  $6\xi_{c}$  being the maximum possible attenuation in signal strength before trainability becomes difficult, as described in Schoenholz et al. (2016).

The reason we see the trainability not diverging in Figure 2 is that training time increases with depth, on top of requiring smaller learning rates for deeper networks, as described in detail in Saxe et al. (2013). The experiment here used the same number of epochs regardless of depth, meaning shallower networks actually had an advantage over deeper networks.

We should note that this theory does not specify for how many steps of training the effects of the initialisation will persist, that is, for how long the network remains close to criticality. Therefore, the number of steps we trained the network for is an arbitrary choice, and thus the experiments validate the theory in a more qualitative than quantitative way. Results were similar for other optimizers, including SGD, SGD with momentum, and RMSprop. Note that these networks were trained without dropout, batchnorm or any other heuristics.

In Figure 3 we present the training performance for the deterministic surrogate and its counterpart binary networks, both deterministic and stochastic. Once again, we test our algorithms on the MNIST dataset and plot results after 5 epochs. We see that the performance of the stochastic network matches more closely the performance of the continuous surrogate, especially as the number of samples increases, from  $N = 5$  to  $N = 100$  samples.

We can report that the number of samples necessary to achieve better classification, at least for more shallow networks, appears to depends on the number of training epochs. In some way, this is a sensible relationship, since during the course of training we might expect the means of the weights to polarise, moving closer to the bounds  $\pm 1$ . Likewise, from experience continuous with neural networks, the neurons, which initially have zero mean pre-activations, are expected to "saturate" during training, that is, they become either always "on"  $(+1)$  or "off"  $(-1)$ . A stochastic network being "closer" to deterministic would require fewer samples overall. We can again report that this phenomena was observed. In the discussion we elaborate on what further experiments and analysis may be required to understand this problem.

# 6 DISCUSSION

In this paper we have theoretically studied, based on self-averaging arguments, binary neural network algorithms using dynamic mean field theory, following the analysis recently developed for

standard continuous neural networks Schoenholz et al. (2016). This first study of a continuous surrogate networks has yielded results of practical significance, revealing that these networks have poor trainability when initialised away from  $\pm 1$ , as is common practice.

One interesting problem this paper opens up is in understanding the relationship between the surrogate networks and the binary counterparts. Interesting results were uncovered for the binary neural networks corresponding to the trained surrogate, both binary and stochastic. It was seen that during training, when evaluating the deterministic and stochastic binary counterparts concurrently with the surrogate, the performance of both binary networks is worse than the continuous model, especially as depth increases. The stochastic binary network was seen to outperform the deterministic binary network, which makes sense since the objective optimised is the expectation over an ensemble of stochastic binary networks.

A study of random binary networks, included in the Appendices, and published recently Blumenfeld et al. (2019) for a different problem, showed that binary networks are always in a chaotic phase. However, when evaluating any binary network which is trained by some algorithm (eg. gradient descent on a given surrogate model), signals will of course propagate forwards through the corresponding binary network. This network will either be deterministic or stochastic. In either case, it makes sense that the closer one is to the early stages of the training process, the closer the signal propagation behaviour is to the randomly initialised case. Consider for a moment the signal propagation behaviour of a continuous network that has been trained, and this is not in its initially random state. This means that, as far as the mean field theory is concerned, the self-averaging behaviour, including any central limit behaviour, cannot be assumed to hold. However, clearly the networks are still performing some useful information processing, and thus are not in either the completely ordered case (asymptotic correlation  $c^\infty = 1$ ) nor the chaotic case ( $c^\infty = 0$ ). As said, it makes sense that the closer one is to the early stages of the training process, the closer the signal propagation behaviour will reflect the randomly initialised case. That is, correlations do not propagate, since there is no edge of chaos condition. However, it is possible that as training progresses the signal propagation behaviour binary counterparts of these surrogates might approach the signal propagation of the trained surrogate model. This may explain the difference in the performance between the surrogate model and its binary counterparts (deterministic or stochastic) early in training, a difference which appears to decrease as training progresses.
