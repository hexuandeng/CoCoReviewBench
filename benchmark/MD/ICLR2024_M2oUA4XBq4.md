# ABSTRACT

Machine learning frequently suffers from the discrepancy in data distribution, commonly known as domain shift. Single-source Domain Generalization (sDG) is a task designed to simulate domain shift artificially, in order to train a model that can generalize well to multiple unseen target domains from a single source domain. A popular approach is to learn robustness via the alignment of augmented samples. However, prior works frequently overlooked what is learned from such alignment. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of augmentation-based sDG methods by analyzing the data generating process. We highlight issues in using augmentation for OOD generalization, namely, the distinction between domain invariance and augmentation invariance. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a novel regularization method that leverages pretrained models to guide the learning process via a feature-level regularization of mutual information, which we name PROF (Progressive mutual information Regularization for Online distillation of Frozen oracles). PROF can be applied to conventional augmentation-based methods to moderate the stochasticity of models repeatedly trained on augmented data. We show that PROF stabilizes the learning process for sDG.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Distribution shift is prevalent in many machine learning settings. The term is often referred to as domain shift, where a domain is understood as the joint probability distribution from which samples are drawn. An important aspect of domain shift is that it severely hinders the generalizability of trained models (Kurakin et al., 2018). The issue is easily observable when a model trained in a source domain suffers in a target domain that is inconsistent with the source. Domain Generalization (DG) is a task specifically devised to test a model's robustness under domain shift, where the model is given multiple labeled datasets at training time (Gulrajani & Lopez-Paz, 2021). Single-source Domain Generalization (sDG) is a variant of DG, where only a single source domain is provided at train time. The absence of additional source domains makes sDG challenging, mainly because conventional DG methods that leverage multiple domains cannot be easily adopted. To overcome such barriers, prior works on sDG often utilize data augmentation to generate unseen domains (Volpi et al., 2018) and learn domain-invariant features through an alignment of the generated domains using self-supervised contrastive loss (Oord et al., 2018) (hereinafter contrastive loss).

However, there is a relative void in the discussion on what is learned through the alignment of augmented samples. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of augmentation-based sDG approaches from a novel perspective of style-content disentanglement. Style-Content (S-C) disentanglement aims to identify a partitioned latent space, namely style, and content (Ren et al., 2021; Hyvarinen & Morioka, 2016). While the definitions of style and content vary across settings, here we define content as latent features that are invariant across augmentations (i.e. augment-invariant), while style is the latent feature subpart that changes with the augmentation. Recently, Von Kugelgen et al. (2021) studied an interesting connection between S-C disentanglement and data augmentation, demonstrating that contrastive learning provably learns to retrieve the augment-invariant features under some assumptions. We connect the discovery to the sDG literature to analyze the effectiveness of retrieving domain-invariant information from augmented data. We examine the problem from a causal standpoint by illustrating it via a causal graph (Pearl, 2009).

We state our contributions as follows. (1) We analyze the single source domain generalization task through the lens of S-C disentanglement and highlight the difficulties of learning domain-invariant information from augmentation-based sDG methods. (2) We empirically show that augmentation-based sDG methods display large fluctuations in OOD performance across various datasets (3) To mitigate the issues brought by the aforementioned obstacles, we introduce a novel regularization method PROF for sDG. (4) We further devise a novel alignment objective MDAR (Multi-Domain Alignment with Redundancy reduction) that serves as a strong sDG baseline.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

Learning domain agnostic models from limited source domains is a longstanding area of investigation. In this section, we revisit related works on S-C disentanglement and domain generalization.

Style-Content Disentanglement S-C disentanglement seeks to separate the aggregated latent variable into two parts, denoted as style and content. While the term style and content originated from the style transfer literature (Mathieu et al., 2016; Szabó et al., 2017), recent works try to push the idea further using concepts of causal inference (Pearl, 2009; Peters et al., 2017) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (Locatello et al., 2018; Gresele et al., 2021; Reizinger et al., 2022). Notably, disentanglement is used to elucidate the underlying mechanism of data augmentation (Von Kugelgen et al., 2021; Ilse et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022; Mitrovic et al., 2021).

Domain Generalization In the multi-source domain generalization field, disentanglement of domain-invariant features has shown great success in training robust domain-agnostic models by leveraging shared information across domains. To learn domain-invariant information, researchers commonly analyze the data generating process (DGP) using structural causal models to design effective algorithms (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Mahajan et al., 2021; Wang & Veitch, 2022). On the contrary, disentanglement is rarely discussed in the sDG literature. This is due to innate conditions of sDG, where only one domain is available for training. This setting makes it hard to apply conventional disentanglement approaches developed in the multi-DG literature. To tackle this, a line of work focuses on how to augment unseen domains effectively with generative models (Volpi et al., 2018; Qiao et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Wan et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2021). However, there is a lack of discussion on whether augmented samples can simulate unseen domains, or whether it can be used to learn domain-invariance. A recent movement in the multi-DG literature highlights the use of pretrained models for OOD generalization, leveraging the knowledge of the pretrained models (Cha et al., 2022; Wortzman et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023). Such works closely resemble the methods introduced in the Knowledge Distillation (KD) literature (Hinton et al., 2015; Adriana et al., 2015; Ahn et al., 2019; Shrivastava et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2020).

# 3 LIMITATIONS OF AUGMENTATION FOR SDG

In this section, we present an overlooked problem of augmentation-based sDG methods. Specifically, we revisit recent works on S-C disentanglement to analyze the effectiveness of utilizing augmentation for out-of-domain generalization.

A general view towards augmentation-based sDG methods We present a general expression for augmentation-based sDG methods and discuss their effectiveness. Generally, augmentation-based methods can be expressed as augment and align, minimizing the following objective (omitting some arguments for simplicity) denoting  $x$  and  $\bar{x}$  as an original sample and its augmented view:

$$
L := L _ {c e} + L _ {\operatorname {M a x E n t}} (x, \bar {x}; \Phi). \tag {1}
$$

where  $L_{ce}$  is the cross-entropy loss  $L_{ce}(\mathbf{y},\hat{\mathbf{y}}) = -\sum_{i}y_{i}\log (\hat{y}_{i})$  with  $\mathbf{y}$  the ground truth,  $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$  the softmax prediction of the model, and  $L_{\mathrm{MaxEnt}}$  is an objective that simultaneously aligns the mapped representations  $\Phi (x)$  and  $\Phi (\bar{x})$  under entropy regularization, where  $\Phi$  is a feature extractor. Commonly, contrastive loss is used as  $L_{\mathrm{MaxEnt}}$ . Recently, Von Kugelgen et al. (2021) showed that the optimization of a contrastive loss provably minimizes  $L_{\mathrm{MaxEnt}}$ , learning  $\Phi$  to extract features that are augment-invariant, under a certain condition. In this perspective, conventional augmentation-based sDG methods could be understood as retrieving augment-invariant features.

A causal interpretation of data augmentation We illustrate the underlying data generating process (i.e., DGP) using a causal graph and incorporate data augmentation into the causal graph under the sDG setting. An instance of a given labeled dataset is typically composed of an observation  $X$  (i.e., image) and its label  $Y$ . Although supervised learning predicts  $Y$  directly from  $X$ , this does not reflect the underlying causality. We can think of the existence of hidden features (e.g., real-world attributes regarding the subject of the image and the background), which we will refer  $W$ , that affect both the image and label. At this moment, the causal graph for DGP can be simply represented as  $X \leftarrow W \rightarrow Y$  where  $W$  is unobserved.

![](images/a33e3b64441ac84a2420319ff8947672179cd362439b830f674cd06c74622083.jpg)  
Figure 1: A causal diagram depicting DGP under data augmentation.

Now, we incorporate data augmentation into the picture. Given label-preserving augmentation methods, we attain  $\bar{X}$  the augmented view of  $X$ . Such an augmentation can be considered as manipulating only the style  $S$  (augment-variant) to yield  $\bar{S}$  while retaining its content (augment-invariant)  $C$  where  $C$  and  $S$  partitions  $W$ , that is,  $W = (C, S)$  (see Von Kugelgen et al. (2021) for a detailed discussion). Yet, this does not imply that  $C$  and  $S$  are independent.  $C$  causally affects  $S$  (also corroborated by experimental results (Klindt et al., 2021)). A way to understand this separation is by viewing such an augmentation as a soft intervention (Eberhardt & Scheines, 2007) on  $S$ , resulting in a modified style  $\bar{S}$ . By definition,  $(C, \bar{S})$  becomes the hidden features of  $\bar{X}$ . Furthermore,  $C$  consistently affects  $Y$  regardless of the label-preserving augmentation. This understanding results in the graph in Figure 1 ( $W$  is implicit) excluding  $D$ .

Von Kugelgen et al. (2021) showed that, under certain conditions, the above DGP is sound, and augmentation separates  $C$  and  $S$ . However, the original picture misses an important variable: the domain  $D$ . By definition, observations are drawn from the distribution of the domain, thus latent variables  $W$  are affected by the domain the data is generated from. Therefore it is unavoidable to incorporate a variable indicating domain  $D$  in the figure. In sDG,  $D$  is fixed in the sense that we are given just one domain. Due to the single source setting, we cannot distinguish what information is shared across different domains, leaving both  $C$  and  $S$  potentially affected by  $D$ . Hence, unless the discrepancy between the source and target is moderate, optimizing solely the augment-and-align objective (Eq. 1) would be insufficient to address the issue caused by a large domain gap.

Learning to ignore To address a large domain shift, we begin with some observations. Conventional augment and align methods are vulnerable to domain shift in the sense that their effectiveness is affected by the augmentation's proximity to the domain shift. While advanced augmentation methods may simulate small shifts in distribution (e.g., MNIST  $\rightarrow$  USPS in Digits), it is hard to approximate large domain shifts (e.g., PHOTO  $\rightarrow$  SKETCH in PACS) (Section 5.1). If the gap between the source and target domain is large, failure in simulating domain shift would make its augment-invariant features less relevant to domain-invariant features, leading to overfitting to the source domain.

To avoid learning irrelevant features, we can think of a hypothetical regularizer that encourages the model to learn information relevant to domain-invariance, while discouraging domain-specific features. Certainly, this would require a condition that the regularizer be an oracle that can distinguish domain-invariant information. Using this oracle regularizer, we hope to solve the phenomena commonly associated with the large domain gap. Especially, the mid-training fluctuation of OOD performance, which was observed in earlier sDG works (Qiao et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) but not discussed in-depth.<sup>1</sup> We view that the fluctuation is strongly correlated with the challenge in acquiring domain-invariant features under a large domain gap. We empirically observe that the level of domain gap between the source and target closely matches the magnitude of the mid-train fluctuation, where the increase in domain gap is simultaneously observed with the increase in fluctuation. Detailed information regarding the measure of domain gap is included in Section 5.2. We view mid-training fluctuation as a serious issue since it manifests that the simulated domains do not properly reflect unseen domains and, further, it harms the credibility of learned models due to uncertainty in their real-world performance. In the following section, we search for ways to implement the hypothetical oracle regularizer, inspired by works in knowledge distillation.

Figure 2: The illustration of our method. We sequentially train multiple generators  $G_{1\dots K}$ . The Oracle  $H_{o}$  regulates the task model  $H$ 's learning process. During the training, multiple modules (e.g.,  $P, V, C$ ) are used for optimization.

# 4 LEVERAGING PRETRAINED MODELS TO LEARN DOMAIN INVARIANCE

We present a novel single source domain generalization method where the aim is to alleviate the issue of mid-train fluctuation. While the general principle of our approach is orthogonal to the type of the data, in this paper, we focus on image data. The overview of our architecture is depicted in Figure 2. At large, the architecture for our method involves three neural networks, a domain generator  $G$ , task model classifier  $F$ , and an oracle  $O$ . We sequentially learn multiple domain generators  $\{G_k\}_{k=1}^K$  and use augmented samples created by the generators to train the task model  $F$ . More specifically, the generators provide the task model with challenging augmented samples, while the task model guides the generator to create valid augmentations. We train the above process using a combination of two losses:  $L = L_f + w_g \cdot L_g$  where  $L_f$  (Eq. 2) and  $L_g$  (Eq. 10) are the loss used to train the task model and the generator, respectively, and  $w_g \in \{0,1\}$  controls the training of  $G$ . The exact forms for  $L_f$  and  $L_g$  will become clear at the end of this section.

We build our method upon the idea that learning domain invariance solely from augmented domains is vulnerable to overfitting to the source, especially when the domain gap is too large to simulate via data augmentation. To alleviate this issue, we propose an oracle regularizer: under the hypothesis that the oracle is capable of generalizing well to unseen domains, we use the oracle to guide the task model to become less domain-dependent. Specifically, our oracle regularization objective regulates the sDG process via an alignment between the hidden feature representation of the task model and the oracle, which we name PROF. In the following section, we elaborate our ideas in depth.

Notation We begin by introducing related notation regarding our method. To begin with, calligraphic letters are used to denote state space of a variable. For example,  $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}$ , and  $\mathcal{H}$  respectively represent the space of the input image, intermediate feature representation, and labels.

- Task model: The task model  $F = C \circ H$  consists of a feature-extractor  $H : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{H}$  and a classification head  $C : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{Y}$ .  
- Generator: A trainable generator  $G:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$  consists of an encoder-decoder architecture with a style-transfer module placed between the encoder and decoder.  
- Oracle: The oracle model  $O = C_{o} \circ H_{o}$  consists of a frozen feature-extractor  $H_{o}: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{H}$  and a trainable classification head  $C_{o}: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{Y}$ . Task model  $F$  and oracle model  $O$  use separate feature-extractors ( $H$  and  $H_{o}$ ) to map the input data as intermediate representation and pass the representation to the classification head ( $C$  and  $C_{o}$ ) for the downstream classification task. For experimental purposes, we match the dimension of representation for the oracle and task model.  
- Distillation Head: The distillation head  $V:\mathcal{H}\to \mathcal{V}$  is used to impose regularization for the task model via oracle's representation. Instead of directly comparing the intermediate representation in  $\mathcal{H}$ , representations from  $H_{o}$  and  $H$  are mapped through the shared distillation head  $V$ , following the analysis of Gupta et al. (2022) on the efficacy of projection heads.  
- Projection Head: Similar to the distillation head, the task model uses a projection head  $P: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{Z}$  to project the intermediate representations into a different dimension. The projection

head is reserved for alignment of augmented views with MDAR, and its associated adversarial loss  $L_{adv}$ , thus not for PROF.

We train the task model  $F$  using a weighted combination of multiple losses, namely, the cross-entropy classification loss of  $x(L_{ce})$  and  $\bar{x}$  ( $L_{cls}$ ; Equation (6)), with  $L_{\mathrm{PROF}}$  and  $L_{\mathrm{MDAR}}$  written as:

$$
L _ {f} = L _ {c e} \left(C (H (x)), y\right) + L _ {c l s} + w _ {\mathrm {P R O F}} \cdot L _ {\mathrm {P R O F}} + w _ {\mathrm {M D A R}} \cdot L _ {\mathrm {M D A R}}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $w_{\mathrm{PROF}}$  and  $w_{\mathrm{MDAR}}$  is a user-set parameter to activate two different methods, the oracle regularization PROF and our baseline MDAR. When training with the oracle regularizer (PROF) alone,  $w_{\mathrm{PROF}}$  is non-zero while  $w_{\mathrm{MDAR}}$  is set as 0. Vice versa,  $w_{\mathrm{PROF}}$  is set as 0 in our baseline (MDAR). We explain losses for PROF and MDAR in the next sections.

# 4.1 ORACLE REGULARIZER

We devise a novel learning method PROF (Progressive mutual information Regularization for Online distillation of Frozen oracles) to guide the learning process. PROF reformulates the sDG problem under the assumption that if there exists an oracle model  $O$  that can generalize well to unseen domains, we can leverage the oracle to learn sDG. The objective for PROF can be formulated as:

$$
L _ {\mathrm {P R O F}} (x, \bar {x}, \lambda_ {\mathrm {P R O F}}) = \sum_ {x ^ {\prime} \in \{x, \bar {x} \}} \operatorname {B T} \left(V \left(H \left(x ^ {\prime}\right)\right), V \left(H _ {o} \left(x ^ {\prime}\right)\right), \lambda_ {\mathrm {P R O F}}\right) \tag {3}
$$

where  $x$  denotes the original sample and  $\bar{x}$  the augmented view created by  $G$ ,  $\lambda_{\mathrm{PROF}}$  is a user-set parameter, and Barlow Twins (BT) is defined as (Zbontar et al., 2021):

$$
\operatorname {B T} \left(z, z ^ {+}, \lambda\right) = \sum_ {i} \left(1 - M _ {i i}\right) ^ {2} + \lambda \sum_ {i} \sum_ {j \neq i} M _ {i j} ^ {2}, \tag {4}
$$

where  $M$  refers to the cross-correlation matrix of the two positive-pair feature representations  $z$ ,  $z^{+}$ , and  $\lambda$  a user-set parameter. BT (Eq. 4) is a feature-decorrelation loss originally introduced as a contrastive learning objective. BT is a combination of two terms balanced via a hyperparameter  $\lambda$ , where the first term  $\sum_{i}(1 - M_{ii})^{2}$  aligns two representations by spurring the diagonal values in  $M$  of  $(z, z^{+})$  to be 1 while the second term  $\sum_{i}\sum_{j\neq i}M_{ij}^{2}$  minimizes redundancy in the representation by encouraging the off-diagonal values to be closer to 0.

Discussion on the Regularization via MI Optimization The idea of PROF is that we can distill the oracle's knowledge into the task model by maximizing the shared information between the two models. PROF aims to maximize the MI between the intermediate output features of the two feature-extractors  $H$  and  $H_{o}$ . PROF functions as a regularization term that guides the task model from deviating too far from the oracle, encouraging the student task model to learn the oracle's behavior on data. From this perspective, an intended objective for PROF could be formulated as  $\max_{H} I(H(x); H_{o}(x))$  where  $I(X;Y) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x,y)}[\log p(x|y) / p(x)]$  indicates the mutual information (MI). However, directly estimating and optimizing MI are challenging, as the exact estimation of MI is intractable (Paninski, 2003). There exists InfoNCE loss (Oord et al., 2018) which adopts a lower bound of MI (Poole et al., 2019) as a surrogate objective for MI optimization:

$$
I _ {\mathrm {N C E}} (X; Y) \triangleq \mathbb {E} \left[ K ^ {- 1} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {K} \log \frac {\exp (f (x _ {i} , y _ {i}))}{K ^ {- 1} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {K} \exp (f (x _ {i} , y _ {i}))} \right] \leq I (X; Y).
$$

However, an issue of InfoNCE as a variational bound of MI is that InfoNCE requires a large batch size for convergence (Shrivastava et al., 2023; Hjelm et al., 2019), making it doubtful for use in small datasets (e.g., PACS). Consequently, we indirectly approximate InfoNCE with a feature decorrelation loss (Zbontar et al., 2021), based on empirical and theoretical results that show its functional proximity (Huang et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2022). Contrary to InfoNCE, the feature decorrelation converges effectively with small batch sizes and large vector dimensions.

Now we discuss the availability of an oracle. In reality, oracles may not be readily available. However, previous studies (Cha et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023) report that models pretrained from a large dataset or with deeper models tend to generalize better at unseen domains. Considering this, we utilize a model pretrained on a larger domain as an oracle. To preserve the knowledge of the oracle, we freeze the feature-extractor  $H_{o}$  of the oracle.

# 4.2 MULTI-DOMAIN ALIGNMENT WITH REDUNDANCY REDUCTION

We now introduce a novel alignment objective MDAR (Multi-Domain Alignment with Redundancy reduction) for sDG. MDAR aims to disentangle latent features that are invariant across multiple augmented views. We design MDAR as a fair baseline of the conventional augment and align method. In learning the  $k$ th generator  $G_{k}$ , we create an augmented view  $\bar{x}$  for a batch of original samples  $x$  using the  $k$ th generator  $G_{k}$ . We then randomly load two previously learned generators to construct two augmented views  $\bar{x}'$  and  $\bar{x}''$ . With  $\{x, \bar{x}, \bar{x}', \bar{x}''\}$ , we encourage their representations vary in a similar way. Hence, we use BT (Eq. 4) over the representations for  $\{x, \bar{x}, \bar{x}', \bar{x}''\}$  obtained through the projection head and feature extractor,  $P \circ H$ . That is, their cross-correlation matrix  $M$  to be closer to an identity matrix. Our alignment loss  $L_{\mathrm{MDAR}}$  is written as:

$$
L _ {\mathrm {M D A R}} \left(\mathbf {x} = \left\{x, \bar {x}, \bar {x} ^ {\prime}, \bar {x} ^ {\prime \prime} \right\}, \lambda_ {\mathrm {M D A R}}\right) = \sum_ {x _ {i} \neq x _ {j}} \operatorname {B T} \left(P \left(H \left(x _ {i}\right)\right), P \left(H \left(x _ {j}\right)\right), \lambda_ {\mathrm {M D A R}}\right), \tag {5}
$$

where  $\lambda_{\mathrm{MDAR}}$  a user-set parameter. Intuitively, via optimizing  $L_{\mathrm{MDAR}}$ , we can train the task model in a way that multiple views (representations) are aligned. In terms of S-C disentanglement, MDAR encourages the retrieval of augment-invariant features. Different from the commonly used InfoNCE loss, our objective (Eq. 5) does not require negative pairs, thus works well on small batch sizes (Zbontar et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2021), suitable for benchmarks like PACS.

In our conventional augment and align baseline experiment, we train our model with a variant of Eq. 2:  $L_{f} = L_{ce}(C(H(x)),y) + L_{cls} + w_{\mathrm{MDAR}} \cdot L_{\mathrm{MDAR}}$ .

# 4.3 LEARNABLE DOMAIN SHIFT SIMULATORS

We sequentially train multiple generators to obtain varying simulated domains. The purpose of this process is to examine the behavior of models repeatedly trained on simulated domains, namely, the mid-train OOD fluctuation. To simulate domain shift, we must ensure that the augmented domain is label-preserved, while different from the source domain. Reflecting this, we adopt methods of Wang et al. (2021); Li et al. (2021) to assure the consistency of generated samples:

$$
L _ {c l s} (\bar {x}, y) = L _ {c e} \left(C (H (\bar {x})), y\right) + I \left(w _ {\mathrm {P R O F}} > 0\right) \cdot L _ {c e} \left(C _ {o} \left(H _ {o} (\bar {x})\right), y\right), \tag {6}
$$

$$
L _ {c y c} (x, \bar {x}) = \| x - G _ {c y c} (\bar {x}) \| _ {2}, \tag {7}
$$

where  $I$  is an indicator function.  $L_{cls}$  is a cross-entropy loss that assures the validity of the generated samples  $\bar{x}$  based on predictions from task model  $F$  (also from oracle  $O$  if PROF is employed.)  $L_{cyc}$  ensures that the output of  $G$ , can be recovered to the original input image when passed through the inversed generator  $G_{cyc}$  (Zhu et al., 2017).

Next, we encourage the generator to create diverse augmentations with the following objectives:

$$
L _ {d i v} \left(\bar {x} _ {1}, \bar {x} _ {2}\right) = - \| \bar {x} _ {1} - \bar {x} _ {2} \| _ {2}, \tag {8}
$$

$$
L _ {a d v} (x, \bar {x}, \lambda_ {a d v}) = - \mathrm {B T} (P (H (x)), P (H (\bar {x})), \lambda_ {a d v}). \tag {9}
$$

$L_{div}$  is a negated L2-norm between two augmented views  $(\bar{x}_1,\bar{x}_2)$  of a batch  $x$  created with the generator. Intuitively, optimizing with  $L_{div}$  encourages the generator to augment diverse samples, preventing collapse.  $L_{adv}$  is an adversarial loss function designed to reverse the alignment process by negating the feature-decorrelation loss used in Eq. 4.

We train the generator with the weighted sum  $L_{g}$  of the above four objectives:

$$
L _ {g} = L _ {\text {c l s}} + w _ {\text {c y c}} \cdot L _ {\text {c y c}} + w _ {\text {d i v}} \cdot L _ {\text {d i v}} + I \left(w _ {\text {M D A R}} > 0\right) \cdot w _ {\text {a d v}} \cdot L _ {\text {a d v}}, \tag {10}
$$

where  $L_{adv}$  is active only if MDAR is used.

# 5 EXPERIMENT

We first present our experimental settings including datasets and architectures. Then, we report experimental results using the accuracy for each target domain, as well as the mean accuracy over all target domains. We designed our experiments to be reproducible.

# 5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

Datasets Following the experimental settings in prior sDG works (Qiao et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021), we adopted three broadly used benchmarks for our sDG problem, along with an additional benchmark. PACS (Li et al., 2017) is widely used to test the generalizability of trained models against domain shift. It consists of 4 domains of differing styles (Photo, Art, Cartoon, and Sketch) with 7 classes. In default, we train our model with the Photo domain and evaluate the remaining target domains. We also present additional experiments in Appendix A.1. Among the selected benchmarks, PACS is the main target of PROF due to its large gap between domains. Corrupted CIFAR-10 (i.e. CIFAR-10-C) is a benchmark to test the image classifier robustness under distortion (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019). We train our model with the train split of the CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) dataset and test the model accuracy in CIFAR-10-C. We evaluate the robustness of the model with 19 types and 5 levels of corruption. Unlike other benchmarks, we expect that the CIFAR-10-C is sufficient with conventional augment and align methods, as each target domain is created via augmentation of the source domain. Digits dataset is a popular benchmark for sDG, comprised of 5 different digit classification datasets, MNIST (Deng, 2012), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), MNIST-M (Ganin et al., 2015), SYNDIGIT (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015), USPS (Le Cun et al., 1989). In our experiment, we train our model with the first 10,000 samples of the MNIST dataset and assess its generalization accuracy across the remaining four domains. Office-Home dataset (Venkateswara et al., 2017) is a common benchmark for DG, but not used for sDG. The benchmark consists of 4 datasets (Real-world, Art, Clipart, Product) with differing styles with 65 classes. We train our model on the Real-world domain and evaluate the remaining domains.

Implementation In all experiments, we utilized the identical network architectures used in previous sDG works. For PACS, we adopted AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) pretrained onImagenet (Russakovsky et al., 2014). For corrupted CIFAR-10, we used a Wide Residual Network (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) of depth 16, and width 4. For Digits, we used the identical network architecture (i.e. conv-pool-conv-pool-fc-fc-softmax) used in previous works. For Office-Home, we used a ResNet18 (He et al., 2016) pretrained on ImageNet-1K dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2014). For an oracle, we selected pretrained models appropriate for each experiment. For PACS and OfficeHome, we chose a RegNetY-16GF (Radosavovic et al., 2020) pretrained on Instagram dataset with SWAG (Supervised Weakly through hashtAGs) (Singh et al., 2022) following experimental reports of Cha et al. (2022); Li et al. (2023). For Corrupted CIFAR-10, we selected anImagenet pretrained ResNet50. For Digits, we followed the practice of Cha et al. (2022) and used a true oracle pretrained on both the source and target domains of Digits. All oracles are finetuned on the source domain (e.g. Photo, CIFAR-10, MNIST, Real World) and frozen. We test the sensitivity of the hyperparameters using the validation split of the source dataset. Details regarding the training hyperparameters, pretraining process, training process, and the generator module are reported in Appendix B.4, Appendix B.3, Appendix B.2, and Appendix B.1, respectively.

# 5.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

Here we present experimental results over the four benchmark datasets, examination on domain gaps and the effect of PROF.

Experiment with PACS The aim of the PACS experiment is to show that PROF functions as a stable regularizer for sDG, reducing the mid-train OOD fluctuation reported in conventional augment and align methods. The results of the PACS experiment are reported in Table 1 where AN, RN, M, and P stands for AlexNet, ResNet18, MDAR, and PROF, respectively.

First, we compare the generalization accuracy. Training AlexNet with PROF (Eq.(2)) showed results close to the current SOTA (Wan et al., 2022) without the use of alignment. Furthermore, we showed state-of-the-art performance in the Sketch domain, where domain gap is considered to be the largest. Similarly, our augment and align baseline using

MDAR also showed an accuracy close to SOTA. However, we observe that the method using MDAR displays a fluctuation of OOD performance after a certain point (i.e.  $K > 5$ ). The behavior worsened as training continued. On the contrary, training with PROF resulted in stabilization of the OOD performance, mitigating fluctuations, quantified as the reduction in variance across the target domain accuracy in  $K > 5$  (Art:  $3.39 \rightarrow 1.27$ , Cartoon:  $5.22 \rightarrow 2.49$ , Sketch:  $7.23 \rightarrow 5.30$ ). The midtrain OOD stabilization effect is depicted in Figure 3. Finally, we show the competitiveness of our baseline (MDAR). We applied MDAR to an existing sDG method (Wang et al., 2021) by replacing the InfoNCE loss with MDAR. We observe a wide improvement over the conventional methods under certain conditions, as recorded in the last rows of Table 1.

Experiment with Corrupted CIFAR-10 We present results over CIFAR-10-C (Table 2) where we compare the effectiveness of the conventional augment and align method (MDAR) and PROF under small domain shifts. We report the average accuracy  $(\%)$  of each corruption category (Weather, Blur, Noise, Digits), and the average accuracy of all categories. Our baseline using MDAR marked scores close to the current SOTA (Wan et al., 2022) in two categories Weather and Blur while falling behind in others, Noise and Digital. We report that the OOD performance of the CIFAR-10-C is greatly affected by the design of the domain simulator  $G$ . On the

contrary, our method using PROF marked results lower than our baseline MDAR. This is anticipated as we view the domain gap to be small between different datasets in the CIFAR-10-C, whereas PROF is designed for use under large domain discrepancies.

Experiment with Digits We share our results on the digit experiment on Table 3. The aim of the Digits experiment is to validate the efficacy of the oracle regularization (PROF) and present the strength of our baseline (MDAR). We underline in advance that in the Digits benchmark, we could not obtain a pretrained model fit for use as the oracle. Hence, we follow the practice of Cha et al. (2022) and use a true oracle, a model pretrained on both the source and target domains. Our method with PROF showed a large drop in mid-train

OOD fluctuation compared to the baseline (M-M:  $2.56 \rightarrow 1.17$ , USPS:  $3.48 \rightarrow 1.11$ , SVHN:  $3.58 \rightarrow 1.95$ , S-D:  $2.36 \rightarrow 2.10$ ). The OOD stabilization effect is illustrated in Figure 5 (Appendix A.2). Furthermore, PROF displays superior generalization accuracy (81.82) compared to existing methods, which is expectable from the perspective of knowledge distillation. Similarly, our baseline using MDAR surpassed state-of-the-art records. Analysis on PROF and MDAR continue in Appendix A.2.

Experiment with Office-Home The aim of the Office-Home experiment is to stress the effectiveness of PROF for mitigating the issues of stochasticity under large distributional shifts. We report the results of the Office-Home experiment on Table 4, where RN stands for ResNet18.

In terms of performance, our method using PROF displayed a strong advantage over the conventional baseline with MDAR. In terms of OOD fluctuation, regularizing with PROF displayed a stabilization of the OOD performance, measured as the reduction in variance across the target domain accuracy (Art:  $10.63\rightarrow 8.23$  ,Clipart: 2.17  $\rightarrow 2.05$  Product:  $7.46\to 6.41$  ). The stabilization effect is illustrated in Figure 6 (Appendix A.3). Detailed analy

sis on the Office-Home experiment is reported in Appendix A.3.

Experiment on domain gaps We show results that display a strong correlation between the level of domain gap and the magnitude of mid-train fluctuation. In Digits, it is commonly viewed that

the gap between the source (MNIST) and the target is greater in certain datasets (e.g., SVHN and SYNDIGIT) over others (e.g., MNIST-M and USPS). For instance, the baseline OOD accuracy is much higher in some target domains as opposed to others, in the order of:  $\mathrm{USPS}(76.94\%) > \mathrm{MNIST-M}(52.72\%) > \mathrm{SYNDIGIT}(39.65\%) > \mathrm{SVHN}(27.83\%)$ , as recorded in Table 3. We elaborate the domain gap further in Appendix C. Interestingly, in our baseline experiment using the conventional augment and align method, we find that the mid-train fluctuation follows the same order:  $\mathrm{USPS}(1.211) < \mathrm{MNIST-M}(1.1795) < \mathrm{SYNDIGIT}(4.938) < \mathrm{SVHN}(5.106)$ , measured by the variance of the OOD accuracy after  $K > 5$ . A similar pattern is observed on PACS (Table 1), where the baseline OOD accuracy order Art  $(54.43\%)$ , Cartoon  $(42.74\%)$ , and Sketch  $(42.02\%)$  matches the order of the mid-train fluctuation: Art (3.39), Cartoon (5.22), and Sketch (7.23). We view that these results empirically support the correlation between domain gap and mid-train fluctuation.

Effect of PROF We study further the effect of PROF on OOD generalization. Experimental results are illustrated in Figure 3 (A, C, and S are from PACS and M and P from MDAR and PROF.) The stabilization effect of PROF is repeatedly confirmed across many benchmarks including Digits (Figure 5) and Office-Home (Figure 6). We view that the reduction in mid-train OOD fluctuation ultimately increases the credibility of the model at test time. In real-world settings, a model with large fluctuation is unreliable since its performance may drop unknowingly. Hence, a reduction in fluctuation is closely synonymous with model consistency.

Conversely, using PROF showed limited impact in enhancing generalization accuracy. In experiments performed with AlexNet, the increase in OOD accuracy was

not significant (Table 1). However, using the ResNet18 architecture, OOD accuracy on both Art and Sketch domains benefited from using PROF. Similarly in the Office-Home dataset, using PROF with ResNet18 largely increased the accuracy (Table 4). Our notion is that the model architecture (e.g., width and depth) affects the knowledge transfer capability, though further research is required.

Study of Hyperparameters We further present an examination of our method's hyperparameters. We empirically observe that our method is resilient to individual changes in hyperparameters. The details of the analysis are reported in Appendix A.5.

# 6 CONCLUSION

This paper presents PROF (Progressive mutual information Regularization for Online distillation of Frozen oracles), a novel oracle regularizer to address single source domain generalization under a large domain discrepancy. We underscore the vulnerability of learning robustness via augmentation, which is observed as large fluctuations in the OOD performance during the training process. To mitigate this issue, PROF leverages pretrained oracles to guide the model to learn features that are less domain-specific, via maximization of the feature-level mutual information between the learning model and the oracle. Experiments on multiple datasets (PACS, Digits, Office-Home) demonstrate that PROF can stabilize the fluctuations associated with large domain gaps. We further introduce a strong baseline method with MDAR (Multi-Domain Alignment with Redundancy Reduction) for a fair comparison with PROF. Training with MDAR showed state-of-the-art performance in Digits and displayed a boost in performance when applied to existing methods.
