# Abstract

Algorithms for full-information online learning are classically tuned to minimize the worst-case regret. Modern algorithms in addition provide tighter guarantees outside the maximally adversarial regime, most notably in the form of constant (pseudo)-regret bounds under statistical margin assumptions. We investigate the multiscale extension of the setting, where the loss ranges of the various experts are vastly different, and the regret w.r.t. each expert needs to scale with its range, instead of the maximum overall range. We develop new algorithms, tuning schemes and analysis techniques, and show that indeed one can combine worst-case robustness with adaptation to easy data at negligible cost. We develop an extension with optimism, and apply it to solve multiscale zero-sum games. We demonstrate in experiments the superior performance of our scale-adaptive algorithm. We discuss the subtle relationship of our results to Freund's 2016 open problem.

# 1 Introduction

The abstract problem of online prediction with expert advice [Littlestone and Warmuth, 1994, Freund and Schapire, 1997] is of fundamental importance in computational learning theory. Efficient and optimal algorithms for solving it have a substantial impact on various problems in general online convex optimization [Hazan, 2019], online model selection [Foster et al., 2017], boosting [Freund and Schapire, 1997], and maximal probabilistic inequalities [Rakhlin and Sridharan, 2017], to name a few. Here, a decision maker chooses among experts' advices sequentially, and the environment assigns each advice a scalar loss. If all losses have the same numerical range  $[- \sigma, \sigma]$ , the situation is well understood. Freund and Schapire [1997] showed that, for  $K$  experts and  $t$  rounds, the Hedge algorithm guarantees the minimax regret (defined below)  $\sigma \sqrt{2t\ln K}$ . Modern algorithms guarantee both this minimax regret and lower or even constant regret when the sequence of losses is more benign [see De Rooij et al., 2014, Koolen and Van Erven, 2015, Mourtada and Gaiffas, 2019].

In the multiscale setting, where the loss range may differ by orders of magnitude between experts, it is natural to ask whether there exist algorithms that guarantee an optimal worst-case regret bound that scales with the loss range of the best expert instead of the maximal range. This question has been answered affirmatively [Chen et al., 2021, Bubeck et al., 2019, Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018, Foster et al., 2017]. The algorithms developed in this line of work have had a significant impact in different areas of computational learning theory and practice. Unfortunately, as we will see, the best known algorithms still fail to guarantee lower regret even for the simplest benign statistical cases. Ensuring these goals poses serious technical challenges. In particular, Bernstein's inequality — the engine of classical same-scale luckiness arguments — has no suitable multiscale upgrade. Moreover, intuitive candidate upgrades of same-scale results would violate recent lower bounds (see Section 7). To make things worse, in order to obtain multiscale regret bounds, close attention needs to be paid to terms that are conventionally insignificant but now carry the maximum scale of the problem. This motivates our main question: Can a single algorithm have the multiscale worst-case regret guarantees and in addition exhibit constant (pseudo-)regret in stochastic lucky cases?

We answer the previous question positively; the key contribution in this article is MUSCADA (multiscale adaptive), a computationally efficient algorithm that simultaneously guarantees the minimax regret that grows with the scale of the best expert, and constant expected pseudoregret under a stochastic margin condition. MUSCADA uses a refined version of Follow the Regularized Leader based on the multiscale entropy of Bubeck et al. [2019]. Its crucial improvement is a second-order variance-like adaptation, the tightest possible for the analysis of this regularizer. This second-order adaptation is close in spirit to, and an improvement of, that of AdaHedge by De Rooij et al. [2014] and those of Chen et al. [2021]. As a result of careful analysis, MUSCADA has the following attractive properties: It does not need knowledge of the length of the game in advance without resorting to any doubling trick, the presence of zero-regret rounds does not change the state of the algorithm or its regret guarantees; it is invariant under per-round, possibly unknown, translations of each expert's losses; and a global known scaling common to all losses and ranges.

As an application of MUSCADA and its analysis techniques, we build an optimistic variation of the algorithm and use it to solve two-person zero-sum games that have a multiscale structure. The optimistic variation makes use of a guess of what the losses in the next round will be, and achieves lower regret when the guesses are adequate. The reason for this interest is that optimistic algorithms have been proven to converge to the solutions of such games at faster rates than their nonoptimistic counterparts [Syrgkanis et al., 2015]. We find experimentally that MUSCADA outperforms existing single-scale algorithms when the payoff matrix of the game exhibits a multiscale structure.

In the rest of this introduction we lay out formally the multiscale experts problem, review existing work, present a summary of the main contributions (Section 1.1), and outline of the rest of the article.

Full-information online learning. In its simplest form, we must decide sequentially in rounds how to aggregate the predictions made by a fixed number  $K$  of experts. At each round  $t$ , we choose an aggregation strategy; a probability distribution  $w_{t}$  over experts. After choosing  $w_{t}$ , we assess the quality of the experts' predictions with a numerical loss  $\ell_{t} = (\ell_{t,k})_{k\in K}$ , and judge the performance of our aggregation strategy by the  $w_{t}$ -weighted losses  $\langle w_{t},\ell_{t}\rangle = \sum_{k\in K}w_{t,k}\ell_{t,k}$ . Our objective is to minimize the cumulative gap between the losses incurred by our aggregation strategy  $t\mapsto w_t$ , and the best expert in hindsight. This cumulative gap is the regret  $\mathcal{R}_t = \sum_{s = 1}^t\langle \pmb {w}_s,\pmb {\ell}_s\rangle -\min_{k\in K}\sum_{s = 1}^t\ell_{t,k}$ . Other than range restrictions on the losses, no assumptions are made about the mechanism that generates them. More precisely, for each expert  $k\in K$  and all rounds  $t$ , we only assume that  $\ell_{k,t}\in [-\sigma_k,\sigma_k]$  for known nonnegative scales  $\{\sigma_k\}_{k\in K}$ . We call  $R_{t}$  the vector of regrets with respect to each expert, that is, the vector with entries  $R_{t,k} = \sum_{s = 1}^{t}\{\langle \pmb {w}_s,\pmb {\ell}_s\rangle -\ell_{s,k}\}$ .

Existing results. Several algorithms have been proposed that achieve the minimax regret in the multiscale setting, but none of them achieve constant regret in stochastic, lucky cases. Motivated by the problem of online model selection, Foster et al. [2017] used a technique of adaptive relaxations to produce randomized algorithms that guarantee

$$
\mathbf {E} \left[ R _ {t, k} \right] = O \left(\sigma_ {k} \sqrt {t (\ln t + \ln \left(1 / \pi_ {k}\right) + \ln \left(\sigma_ {k} / \sigma_ {\min }\right))}\right)
$$

as  $t\to \infty$  , where  $\pi$  is a prior distribution on experts that generalizes the uniform  $1 / K$  of the Hedge algorithm, and the expectation is over the algorithm's randomness. Bubeck et al. [2019] first proposed a Follow-the-Regularized-Leader algorithm with a multiscale entropy regularization that guarantees

$$
R _ {t, k} = O \left(\sigma_ {k} \sqrt {t (\ln K + \ln \left(\sigma_ {k} / \sigma_ {\min}\right))}\right)
$$

as  $t \to \infty$  when the number of rounds  $t$  is known in advance. Bubeck et al. [2019, Theorem 20] also showed an instance of the experts problem in which there exists an expert  $k'$  for which any algorithm must have  $R_{t,k'} \gtrsim \sigma_{k'} \sqrt{t(\ln K + \ln(\sigma_{\max} / \sigma_{\min}))}$ , almost fully solving the minimax picture. Recently, Chen et al. [2021] designed an optimistic algorithm that uses the same regularization as Bubeck et al. [2019] with an additional ingredient: at each round, a second-order correction is added to the losses before computing the next round's weights. At every round, their algorithm makes use of a guess vector  $\boldsymbol{m}_t$  that can depend on the losses up to time  $t - 1$ . The scale of the guesses  $\boldsymbol{m}_t$  are assumed to be the same as that of the losses,  $|m_{t,k}| \leq \sigma_k$ . For instance, valid choices for the guess  $\boldsymbol{m}_t$  are 0 and the loss  $\ell_{t-1}$  of the previous round. The algorithm of Chen et al. [2021] achieves

$$
R _ {t, k} = O \left(\sigma_ {k} \sqrt {\beta_ {t , k} \ln t} + \sigma_ {\max } \ln t\right)
$$

as  $t\to \infty$ , now scaling with the expert-dependent "time"  $\beta_{t,k} = \sum_{s = 1}^{t}\frac{(\ell_{s,k} - m_{s,k})^2}{\sigma_k^2}\leq 4t$ . Furthermore, they show that a different, single-scale tuning of their algorithm exhibits stochastic luckiness. Namely, if the losses of the experts are sampled from a distribution with a gap  $d_{\mathrm{min}} > 0$  between the expected loss of the best expert  $k^{*}$  and that of any other expert, their algorithm guarantees that

$$
R _ {t, k ^ {*}} = O _ {\mathbf {P}} \left(\frac {\ln t}{d _ {\operatorname* {m i n}}}\right),
$$

where  $\mathbf{P}$  is the distribution of the losses. Their technique for stochastic luckiness uses the upcoming learner's loss as the guess  $m_{t,k} = \langle \pmb{w}_t, \ell_t \rangle$ . Unfortunately, this approach cannot be extended to the multiscale case, as these guesses may violate the experts' loss ranges.

# 1.1 Main results

In this section we present succinctly the regret guarantees for MUSCADA in two parts. Firstly, we present multiscale worst-case regret guarantees. Secondly, we present the stochastic luckiness results and Massart's margin condition. We then prove analogues of this results for an optimistic modification of MUSCADA in Section 4. We close this introduction with an outline of the rest of the article.

Worst-case bounds We propose two tunings for MUSCADA; they cover the cases where there is or is not an expert with loss range equal to zero. Our results imply Theorem 1.1 below; it contains the regret guarantees for MUSCADA, expressed in terms of  $v_{t}$ , an implicitly defined variance-like second-order data-dependent quantity. The quantity  $v_{t}$ , defined by the algorithm, is the tightest allowed by our analysis, and enables our luckiness result Theorem 3.1. We interpret  $v_{t}$  through the upper bounds of Theorem 1.2, also below, as a scale-free internal measure of time, as  $v \leq 4t$ .

Theorem 1.1 (Regret Bounds). Consider MUSCADA and  $t \mapsto v_t$  defined in Figure 1, and any initial probability distribution  $\pi$

- If  $\sigma_{\mathrm{min}} = \min_{k \in K} \sigma_k > 0$ , Tuning 1 guarantees, for any loss sequence,

$$
R _ {t, k} \leq c \sigma_ {k} \sqrt {v _ {t} (\ln (1 / \pi_ {k}) + \ln (\sigma_ {k} / \sigma_ {\min })} + O (1) \quad a s t \rightarrow \infty , \tag {1}
$$

where  $c$  is a constant depending only on  $\pi$ . The constant  $c$  is well-behaved: If  $\max_{k \in K} \pi_k = 1 - \varepsilon$ , then  $c \leq 4\sqrt{2}(1 + 1 / (2\ln(1 + \varepsilon)))$ .

- Even if  $\min_{k\in K}\sigma_k = 0$ , Tuning 2 ensures, for any loss sequence,

$$
R _ {t, k} \leq 2 \sigma_ {k} \sqrt {2 v _ {t} (\ln (1 / \pi_ {k}) + \ln (1 + v _ {t}))} (1 + o (1)) \quad a s t \rightarrow \infty . \tag {2}
$$

The following theorem (proven in Appendix G) shows that  $v_{t}$  can be upper bounded by a second-order quantity. If  $w_{t,k}$  are the weights played by MUSCADA at round  $t$  and  $\eta_{t-1,k}$  its learning rates,  $v_{t}$  is bounded by variance over experts of the losses w.r.t. a tilted distribution  $w_{t,k} \propto w_{t,k} \eta_{t-1,k}$ . The shape of this quantity may seem surprising, but it is not artificial; our analysis shows that it is the tightest and, consequently, the natural second-order quantity associated to this choice of regularization.

Theorem 1.2. Let  $\tilde{w}_{t,k} \propto w_{t,k}\eta_{t-1,k}$  and  $\Delta v_t = v_t - v_{t-1}$ . Then, with either tuning from Figure 2,  $v_t$ , from Figure 1, satisfies

$$
\Delta v _ {t} \leq 4 \frac {\operatorname {v a r} _ {\tilde {\boldsymbol {w}} _ {t}} (\boldsymbol {\ell} _ {t})}{\langle \tilde {\boldsymbol {w}} _ {t} , \boldsymbol {\sigma} ^ {2} \rangle} \leq 4, \quad \text {w h e r e} \quad \operatorname {v a r} _ {\tilde {\boldsymbol {w}} _ {t}} (\boldsymbol {\ell} _ {t}) = \langle \tilde {\boldsymbol {w}} _ {t}, (\boldsymbol {\ell} _ {t} - \langle \tilde {\boldsymbol {w}} _ {t}, \boldsymbol {\ell} _ {t} \rangle) ^ {2} \rangle .
$$

Stochastic luckiness. We now turn to our results for stochastic easy data. Not all stochastic scenarios are easy (in fact, worst-case regret lower bounds are proved using stochastic scenarios). We use Massart's standard margin condition to quantify easiness.

Definition 1.3 (Massart's easiness condition). The losses  $\ell_1, \ell_2, \ldots$  satisfy Massart's easiness condition if they are generated i.i.d. by a distribution  $\mathbf{P}$  with the following property: there exists a constant  $c_{\mathrm{M}}$ , and an expert  $k^* \in K$  such that

$$
\mathbf {E} _ {\mathbf {P}} \left[ \left(\ell_ {t, k} - \ell_ {t, k ^ {*}}\right) ^ {2} \right] \leq c _ {\mathrm {M}} \mathbf {E} _ {\mathbf {P}} \left[ \ell_ {t, k} - \ell_ {t, k ^ {*}} \right]
$$

for all  $k \in K$  and  $t \geq 1$ . In that case,  $k^{*} = \arg \min_{k \in K} \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{P}}[\ell_{t,k}]$  for all  $t$ .

Massart's condition is implied by a more interpretable condition: There exist a gap  $d_{\mathrm{min}} > 0$  in expectation between the loss of any expert and the best one  $k^*$ , that is, for every  $k \neq k^*$ ,  $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{P}}[\ell_{1,k}] \geq d_{\mathrm{min}} + \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{P}}[\ell_{1,k*}]$ . We show the following theorem.

Theorem 1.4 (Constant Regret under Massart's Condition). Under Massart's condition (Definition 1.3), MUSCADA with either Tuning 1 or 2 has constant expected pseudoregret

$$
\mathbf {E} _ {\mathbf {P}} \left[ R _ {t, k ^ {*}} \right] \lesssim 1.
$$

Outline The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce and analyze MUSCADA. In Section 3, we state the main results on stochastic luckiness for MUSCADA. In Section 4, we introduce an optimistic variant of MUSCADA, give remarks about its numerical implementation in Section 5, and apply it to accelerating the solution of multiscale games in Section 6. We end this article with a discussion of our results in Section 7.

# 2 The MUSCADA Multiscale Online Learning Algorithm

We introduce notation, and then describe our algorithm. We motivate the design, present two useful tunings, and prove corresponding worst-case regret bounds. We strengthen intuition by specialising the algorithm to the case of same-scale experts with uniform prior, and compare the resulting closed form to AdaHedge [De Rooij et al., 2014]. Our stochastic luckiness results are in Section 3.

Notation For vectors in  $\mathbb{R}^K$ , we use boldface type for vectors  $(\pmb{R}_t, \pmb{L}_t, \pmb{\mu}_t, \pmb{\eta}_t, \pmb{\sigma}, \pmb{u})$  and distributions  $(\pmb{p}, \pmb{w}, \pmb{\pi})$ . We index rounds so that all quantities indexed by  $t$  depend on the information witnessed by the learner in the first  $t$  rounds. Exceptionally, we use weights  $\pmb{w}_t$  at round  $t$ . For two functions  $f$  and  $g$  we write that  $f = O(g)$  as  $t \to \infty$  if there exists  $c > 0$  such that  $\lim_{t \to \infty} f(t) / g(t) \leq c$ . Similarly,  $f(t) \sim g(t)$  if  $\lim_{t \to \infty} f(t) / g(t) = 1$ , and  $f \lesssim g$  if there is  $c > 0$  so that  $f \leq c g$ . We denote the simplex of probability distributions on  $K$  outcomes by  $\mathcal{P}(K)$ , and use  $K$  interchangeably for a number  $K \in \mathbb{N}$  or the set  $\{1, \ldots, K\}$ .

We define MUSCADA in Figure 1, and give its two main tunings in Figure 2. At round  $t$ , after observing cumulative corrected losses  $L_{t-1} + \mu_{t-1}$ , MUSCADA plays weights

$$
w _ {t, k} = u _ {k} \mathrm {e} ^ {- \eta_ {t - 1, k} \left(L _ {t - 1, k} + \mu_ {t - 1, k} + a _ {t - 1} ^ {*}\right)},
$$

where  $u_{k} > 0$  is a tuning parameter related to the prior weights,  $\pmb{\eta}_{t-1}$  are learning rates that decrease over time,  $\pmb{\mu}_{t}$  are corrections incrementally computed at every round, and the scalar  $a_{t-1}^{*}$  ensures normalization (see Lemma F.7). The weights  $w_{t}$  are reminiscent of those played by the Hedge algorithm, but the normalization  $a_{t}^{*}$  cannot be computed explicitly in general. The weights  $w_{t}$  are the result of a Follow-the-Regularized-Leader update upon a vector of corrected losses  $L_{t-1} + \pmb{\mu}_{t-1}$ . The regularizer employed is the multiscale entropy: For a fixed  $u > 0$ , we use

$$
\boldsymbol {w} \mapsto D _ {\boldsymbol {\eta}} (\boldsymbol {w}, \boldsymbol {u}) = \sum_ {k \in K} w _ {k} \frac {\ln \left(w _ {k} / u _ {k}\right) - \left(1 - u _ {k} / w _ {k}\right)}{\eta_ {k}}, \boldsymbol {w} \in \mathcal {P} (K) \tag {3}
$$

[see Bubeck et al., 2019, Chen et al., 2021]. Data-dependent corrections  $\mu_t$  of second-order type are subtracted from the expert's regrets in order to keep a scalar potential function  $\Phi_t$  negative. Here, the potential  $t \mapsto \Phi_t$  is defined by convex conjugacy with respect to the multiscale entropy as

$$
\Phi_ {t} := \Phi \left(\boldsymbol {R} _ {t} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t}, \boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t}\right) = \max  _ {\boldsymbol {w} \in \mathcal {P} (K)} \left\langle \boldsymbol {w}, \boldsymbol {R} _ {t} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t} \right\rangle - D _ {\boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t}} (\boldsymbol {w}, \boldsymbol {u}). \tag {4}
$$

The corrections  $\mu_t$  and the consequent negativity of the potential  $\Phi_t$  are the main ingredients in the regret analysis of MUSCADA. We next motivate these choices.

The shape of the corrections  $\mu_t$ . We designed MUSCADA to favor experts with low corrected regret,  $R_{t} - \mu_{t}$ . For the sake of informal discussion, the goal is to obtain  $\mu_{t,k} \approx \sigma_k \sqrt{v_t \ln(1 / \pi_k)}$ . The algorithm achieves this by additively correcting the regrets in each round. Indeed, from the analysis of entropy-regularized expert algorithms, one would expect that, the learning rates of the shape  $\eta_{t,k} \approx \frac{1}{\sigma_k} \sqrt{\frac{\ln(1 / \pi_k)}{v_t}}$  are optimal. The desired correction  $\mu_t$  is to be approximated additively over rounds using that  $\sqrt{v_t} = \int_0^{v_t} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{v}} \mathrm{d}v$ , and the Riemann sum approximation  $\mu_{t,k} \approx \sigma_k^2 \sum_{s \leq t} \eta_{s-1,k} \Delta v_s$ , where  $\Delta v_t = v_t - v_{t-1}$  for the conjectured learning rates. This implies that the choice  $\Delta \mu_{t,k} = \sigma_k^2 \eta_{t-1,k} \Delta v_t$  as our per-round additive correction is helpful for achieving our goal. We discuss our precise choice of learning rates after the formal statement of Proposition 2.2 below.

Parameters: A vector  $u_{k} > 0$  of initial weights, initial strictly positive learning rates  $\eta_{0,k} \leq 1 / (2\sigma_{k})$ , and a real, continuous nonincreasing functions  $H_{k}: \mathbb{R}^{+} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  with  $H_{k}(0) = 1$ . Initialization: Let  $\mu_{0,k} = 0$ ,  $v_{0} = 0$ ,  $R_{0,k} = 0$ , and  $L_{0,k} = 0$ . For each round  $t = 1,2,3,\ldots$

1. Play (follow the multiscale-entropy regularized leader of the corrected losses)

$$
\boldsymbol {w} _ {t} = \underset {\boldsymbol {w} \in \mathcal {P} (K)} {\arg \min } \left\langle \boldsymbol {w}, \boldsymbol {L} _ {t - 1} + \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t - 1} \right\rangle + D _ {\boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t - 1}} (\boldsymbol {w}, \boldsymbol {u}), \tag {5}
$$

where  $D_{\eta}$  is the multiscale Bregman divergence given in (3).

2. Observe loss  $\ell_t$ . Update  $R_{t,k} = R_{t - 1,k} + \langle \pmb{w}_t,\pmb{\ell}_t\rangle -\ell_{t,k}$ , and  $L_{t,k} = L_{t - 1,k} + \ell_{t,k}$ .

3. Compute  $\Delta v_{t}$ , the value  $\Delta v\geq 0$  such that

$$
\Phi \left(\boldsymbol {R} _ {t} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t - 1} - \sigma^ {2} \boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t - 1} \Delta v, \boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t - 1}\right) = \Phi \left(\boldsymbol {R} _ {t - 1} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t - 1}, \boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t - 1}\right), \tag {6}
$$

where  $\Phi$  is the potential function defined in (4).

4. Compute  $\Delta \mu_{t,k} = \sigma_k^2\eta_{t - 1,k}\Delta v_t$ . Update  $\mu_{t,k} = \mu_{t - 1,k} + \Delta \mu_{t,k}$ , and  $v_{t} = v_{t - 1} + \Delta v_{t}$

5. Set the new learning rate  $\eta_{t,k} = \eta_{0,k}H_k(v_t)$

Figure 1: MUSCADA

Negativity of  $\Phi$ . Our regret bounds are a direct consequence of the negativity of the potential  $t \mapsto \Phi_t$ . Indeed, by its definition,  $\Phi_0 \leq 0$ , and, because of our choice of nonincreasing learning rates and corrections, the change in potential  $\Delta \Phi_t = \Phi_t - \Phi_{t-1}$  can be bounded by

$$
\Delta \Phi_ {t} \leq \Phi \left(\boldsymbol {R} _ {t} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t}, \boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t - 1}\right) - \Phi \left(\boldsymbol {R} _ {t - 1} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t - 1}, \boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t - 1}\right) = 0,
$$

where the last equality follows from (6), the choice of corrections  $\Delta \mu_t$ . This implies the following lemma, of which we give a more general proof in Section C.1.

Lemma 2.1. The potential  $t \mapsto \Phi_t$  starts at  $\Phi_0 \leq 0$  and is decreasing for  $t \geq 0$ .

Once we prove that the potential  $\Phi_t$  is negative, we are ready to derive regret guarantees for MUSCADA. The maximal nature of the definition of the potential  $t \mapsto \Phi_t$  and its nonpositivity together imply, simultaneously for any distribution  $\pmb{p} \in \mathcal{P}(K)$ , that

$$
\langle \boldsymbol {p}, \boldsymbol {R} _ {t} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t} \rangle \leq D _ {\eta_ {t}} (\boldsymbol {p}, \boldsymbol {u}). \tag {7}
$$

Chose  $\pmb{p}$  concentrated on each expert  $k \in K$  to deduce the next proposition (proof in Section C.1).

Proposition 2.2. Assume that the choice of learning rates  $t \mapsto \eta_t$  is decreasing. MUSCADA guarantees that, for any  $t = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$  and all  $k \in K$ ,

$$
R _ {t, k} \leq \mu_ {t, k} + \frac {\ln \left(1 / u _ {k}\right)}{\eta_ {t , k}} + \sum_ {j \in K} \frac {u _ {j}}{\eta_ {t , j}} - \frac {1}{\eta_ {t , k}}, \tag {8}
$$

where  $\mu_{t,k} = \sigma_k^2\sum_{s\leq t}\eta_{s - 1,k}\Delta v_s$ . Furthermore,  $\pmb{\mu}_{t}$  can be bounded by

$$
\mu_ {t, k} \leq \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} \eta_ {0, k} \int_ {0} ^ {v _ {t}} H _ {k} (x) \mathrm {d} x + \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} \left(\eta_ {0, k} - \eta_ {t, k}\right) \max  _ {s \leq t} \Delta v _ {s}. \tag {9}
$$

Choice of learning rates. Proposition 2.2 guides us in choosing the learning rates, presented in Figure 2. The starting value of the learning rates influences our ability to control  $v_{t}$  in terms of the variance of the losses of the algorithm while their behavior for large  $v_{t}$  determines the long term growth of the regret bounds. The two learning rates presented in Figure 2 interpolate smoothly between these two regimes by taking the form  $\eta_{t,k}^{(1)} = \eta_{0,k}H_{1,k}(v_{t})$ , and  $\eta_{t,k}^{(2)} = \eta_{0,k}H_{2,k}(v_{t})$ . Here, the starting learning rate is set as  $\eta_{0,k} = 1 / (2\sigma_{\mathrm{max}})$ , and the functions  $H_{1,k}, H_{2,k} \leq 1$  shrink monotonically by starting at  $H_{1,k}(0) = H_{2,k}(0) = 1$  and, as  $v_{t} \to \infty$ , decreasing as

$$
\eta_ {t, k} ^ {(1)} \sim \frac {\sqrt {2}}{\sigma_ {k}} \sqrt {\frac {\ln (1 / \pi_ {k})}{v _ {t}}} \qquad \text {a n d} \qquad \eta_ {t, k} ^ {(2)} \sim \frac {\sqrt {2}}{\sigma_ {k}} \sqrt {\frac {\ln (1 / \pi_ {k}) + \ln v _ {t}}{v _ {t}}}.
$$

Let  $\pi \in \mathcal{P}(K)$  be a probability distribution on  $K$  experts.

Tuning 1 Requires  $\sigma_{\mathrm{min}} > 0$ . Set  $u_{k} = \pi_{k}\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{min}}}{\sigma_{k}}$ ,  $\eta_{0,k} = \frac{1}{2\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}}$ ,  $\gamma_{k} = 8\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}}{\sigma_{k}^{2}}\ln (1 / u_{k})$ , and

$$
H _ {1, k} (v) = \frac {\mathrm {d}}{\mathrm {d} v} \left[ \frac {v}{\sqrt {1 + v / \gamma_ {k}}} \right] = \frac {v / \gamma_ {k} + 2}{2 (1 + v / \gamma_ {k}) ^ {3 / 2}}.
$$

Tuning 2 Set  $u_{k} = \pi_{k}, \eta_{0,k} = \frac{1}{2\sigma_{\max}}$ ,  $\alpha_{k} = 32\frac{\sigma_{\max}^{2}}{\sigma_{k}^{2}}$ ,  $\gamma_{k} = \alpha_{k}\ln (1 / u_{k})$ , and

$$
\begin{array}{l} H _ {2, k} (v) = \frac {\mathrm {d}}{\mathrm {d} v} \left[ \sqrt {\alpha_ {k} ^ {2} \left\{(1 + v / \alpha_ {k}) \ln \left(1 + v / \alpha_ {k}\right) - v / \alpha_ {k} \right\} + \frac {v ^ {2}}{2 (1 + v / (2 \gamma_ {k}))}} \right] \\ = \frac {\alpha_ {k} \ln \left(1 + v / \alpha_ {k}\right) + \frac {1}{2} \frac {2 v + v ^ {2} / (2 \gamma_ {k})}{\left(1 + v / (2 \gamma_ {k})\right) ^ {2}}}{2 \sqrt {\alpha_ {k} ^ {2} \left\{\left(1 + v / \alpha_ {k}\right) \ln \left(1 + v / \alpha_ {k}\right) - v / \alpha_ {k} \right\} + \frac {v ^ {2}}{2 \left(1 + v / (2 \gamma_ {k})\right)}}}. \\ \end{array}
$$

If, for some  $k$ ,  $\sigma_{k} = 0$ , define  $H_{2,k}$  to be the limit value  $\lim_{\sigma \downarrow 0} H_{2,k}(v_t) = 1$ .

Figure 2: Tunings

The asymptotic expression for  $\eta_{t,k}^{(1)}$  is reminiscent of the optimal learning rates for the Hedge algorithm with the number of rounds  $t$  replaced by the refined  $v_{t}$ , and the uniform  $\ln K$  replaced by  $\ln (1 / \pi_k)$ . Finally, with the bound (9) from Proposition 2.2 in mind, the learning rates were chosen as the derivatives of functions that will become the dominant term in the regret guarantees.

Tuned regret bounds. The choices of learning rates could be directly plugged in Proposition 2.2 to obtain regret guarantees for MUSCADA. To facilitate interpretation, we bound the learning rates and their reciprocals in order to obtain the regret bounds contained in the following proposition (proof in Appendix C.2). After its statement, we prove Theorem 1.1 from the introduction.

Proposition 2.3. Let  $\pi$  be a probability distribution on  $K$ .

- MUSCADA run with Tuning 1 depicted in Figure 2 guarantees that, for any  $t = 1,2,\ldots$

$$
R _ {t, k} \leq 2 \sigma_ {k} \sqrt {2 v _ {t} \ln \left(1 / u _ {k}\right)} + c _ {\sigma , \pi} \sigma_ {\min } \sqrt {2 v _ {t}} + 8 \sigma_ {\max } \ln \left(1 / u _ {k}\right) + 4 \sigma_ {\max } + \frac {\sigma_ {k}}{2} \max  _ {s \leq t} \Delta v _ {s}, \tag {10}
$$

where the constant  $c_{\sigma, \pi} = \sum_{k \in K} \pi_k \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{\ln(1 / u_k)}} \right)$ , and  $u_k = \pi_k \frac{\sigma_{\min}}{\sigma_k}$ .

- MUSCADA run with Tuning 2 depicted in Figure 2 guarantees that, for any  $t = 1,2,\ldots$

$$
R _ {t, k} \leq 2 \sigma_ {k} \sqrt {2 v _ {t} \left(\ln \left(1 + \frac {\sigma_ {k} ^ {2} v _ {t}}{3 2 \sigma_ {\max } ^ {2}}\right) + \ln \left(1 / \pi_ {k}\right)\right)} + \sigma_ {k} \ln \left(1 / \pi_ {k}\right) Z _ {k} + \sum_ {j \in K} \pi_ {j} \sigma_ {j} Z _ {j} + \frac {\sigma_ {k}}{2} \max  _ {s \leq t} \Delta v _ {t}, \tag {11}
$$

$$
\text {w h e r e} Z _ {k} = \sqrt {\frac {v _ {t}}{2 \ln \left(1 + \frac {\sigma_ {k} ^ {2} v _ {t}}{3 2 \sigma_ {\max} ^ {2}}\right)}} \left(1 + \sqrt {\frac {\min \{\ln (1 / \pi_ {k}) , \frac {\sigma_ {k} ^ {2} v _ {t}}{1 6 \sigma_ {\max} ^ {2}} \}}{\ln \left(1 + \frac {\sigma_ {k} ^ {2} v _ {t}}{3 2 \sigma_ {\max} ^ {2}}\right)}}\right) = O \left(\sqrt {\frac {v _ {t}}{\ln v _ {t}}}\right) a s v _ {t} \to \infty .
$$

Proof of Main Theorem 1.1. With Proposition 2.3 at hand, we can prove the claims made in Section 1.1. Use the fact that  $\sigma_{\mathrm{min}} \leq \sigma_k$  to conclude from (10) that, as  $t \to \infty$ ,

$$
R _ {t, k} \leq 2 \sigma_ {k} \sqrt {2 v _ {t} \ln (1 / u _ {k})} + 2 c _ {\sigma , \pi} \sigma_ {k} \sqrt {2 v _ {t}} + O (1).
$$

We can bound  $c_{\sigma, \pi} / \sqrt{\ln(1 / u_k)} \leq 1 / \ln(1 / \pi_{\max})$  where  $\pi_{\max} = \max_{k \in K} \pi_k$ , and consequently

$$
R _ {t, k} \leq 2 \sigma_ {k} \left\{1 + 1 / \left(2 \ln (1 + \varepsilon)\right) \right\} \sqrt {2 v _ {t} \ln \left(1 / u _ {k}\right)} + O (1),
$$

as  $t\to \infty$  anytime that  $\pi_{\mathrm{max}} = 1 - \varepsilon$ . This coincides with (1). Similarly, (11) implies (2).

# 2.1 Closed-form solutions in the single scale, uniform prior case

To help in the interpretation, and illustrate the challenges of the multiscale problem, we instantiate MUSCADA to a situation where all calculations can be carried in closed form: When all scales are the same and equal to  $\sigma$ , and the initial weights  $\pi_{\mathrm{Unif}}$  are uniform;  $\pi_{\mathrm{Unif},k} = 1 / K$ . This is the setting in which AdaHedge by De Rooij et al. [2014] operates. In this case, the learning rates and corrections of MUSCADA are the same for all experts;  $\eta_{t,k} = \eta_t$  and  $\Delta \mu_{t,k} = \Delta \mu_t$ . The potential  $\Phi_t$  and the corrections take the familiar form

$$
\Phi_ {t} = \frac {1}{\eta_ {t}} \ln \left(\frac {1}{K} \sum_ {k \in K} \mathrm {e} ^ {\eta_ {t} \left(R _ {t, k} - \mu_ {t, k}\right)}\right) \quad \text {a n d} \quad \Delta \mu_ {t, k} = \frac {1}{\eta_ {t - 1}} \ln \sum_ {k \in K} w _ {t, k} \mathrm {e} ^ {\eta_ {t - 1} \left(\langle \boldsymbol {w} _ {t}, \boldsymbol {\ell} _ {t} \rangle - \boldsymbol {\ell} _ {t}\right)}.
$$

These two quantities play a central role in the analysis of AdaHedge, where De Rooij et al. [2014] called  $\Delta \mu_{t}$  the mixability gap, the difference between the average  $\langle \boldsymbol{w}_t,\boldsymbol {\ell}_t\rangle$  and the mixed average  $-\frac{1}{\eta_{t - 1}}\ln \sum_{k\in K}w_{t,k}\mathrm{e}^{-\eta_{t - 1}\ell_{t,k}}$ . The main quantity in our analysis,  $\Delta v_{t}$ , becomes

$$
\Delta v _ {t} = \frac {1}{\eta_ {t - 1} ^ {2} \sigma^ {2}} \ln \sum_ {k \in K} w _ {t, k} \mathrm {e} ^ {\eta_ {t - 1} (\langle \boldsymbol {w} _ {t}, \boldsymbol {\ell} _ {t} \rangle - \ell_ {t, k})}.
$$

It can be bounded by the ratio  $\mathrm{var}_{\boldsymbol{w}_t}(\ell_t) / \sigma^2$  using well-known estimates for cumulant generating functions. Indeed, Hoeffding's inequality implies the worst-case bound  $\Delta v_{t}\leq \frac{1}{2}$ ; Bernstein's, the second-order  $\Delta v_{t}\lesssim \mathrm{var}_{\boldsymbol{w}_{t}}(\ell_{t}) / \sigma^{2}$ . Since it is  $v_{t}$  that appears on the regret bounds in Proposition 2.3, they are a refinement over those of AdaHegde<sup>1</sup>. Additionally, the present analysis yields improvements that are apparent in lower-order terms. Indeed, the last two terms in the regret bound (8) in Proposition 2.2 vanish, and the analysis used in the proof of Proposition 2.3 with  $\eta_0 = \sqrt{2} /\sigma$ , and the instantiation of  $H_{1}$  from Figure 2,  $H_{1}(x) = \frac{x / \ln(K) + 2}{2(1 + x / \ln(K))^{3 / 2}}$ , give the regret bound

$$
\mathcal {R} _ {t} \leq \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} c _ {1} \sigma v _ {t} + c _ {2} \sigma \ln K + \sigma / 2 & \text {i f} v _ {t} \leq \ln K, \\ 2 \sigma \sqrt {2 v _ {t} \ln K} + \sigma / 2 & \text {i f} v _ {t} > \ln K, \end{array} \right.
$$

with  $c_{1} = 3 / \sqrt{2}$  and  $c_{2} = 1 / \sqrt{2}$ . Unfortunately, multiscale analogues of Bernstein and Hoeffding's inequalities on  $v_{t}$  are not available; considerably more technical work needs to be carried out to prove Theorem 1.2. A multiscale analogue of Bernstein's estimate for  $\Delta v_{t}$  is only available when all the learning rates are smaller than  $1 / (2\sigma_{\mathrm{max}})$  (see the proof of Theorem 1.2 in Appendix G).

# 3 Multiscale Stochastic Luckiness

Assume that the loss vectors  $\ell_1, \ell_2, \ldots$  are iid and are generated according to a distribution  $\mathbf{P}$  that satisfies Massart's easiness condition (see Definition 1.3). For Tuning 1, assume that the minimum scale among experts  $\sigma_{\mathrm{min}}$  is strictly positive. The analysis technique in this case is similar to that of Koolen et al. [2016] with an extra step. A use of Theorem 1.2 shows that  $\Delta v_t$  can be estimated in terms of  $\mathrm{var}_{w_t}(\ell_t)$ . This estimate possibly incurs in a multiplicative factor that can be as high as  $1 / \sigma_{\mathrm{min}}^2$ . There are examples for which this constant is necessary (not shown). After this, standard arguments show that the expected pseudoregret is constant. See Appendix E for proofs.

Theorem 3.1. Under Massart's condition, and using Tuning 1 from Figure 2, the expected regret is bounded from above by a constant in the number of rounds, that is, for any  $t \geq 0$ ,

$$
\mathbf {E} _ {\mathbf {P}} \left[ R _ {t, k ^ {*}} \right] \lesssim 1.
$$

For Tuning 2, where we do not assume that  $\sigma_{\mathrm{min}} > 0$ , still  $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{P}}[R_{t,k^*}] \lesssim 1$  using a different proof technique. Using the expression for the weights of the algorithm, we show that they concentrate on the best expert  $k^*$ . The analysis here is similar to that of Mourtada and Gaiffas [2019], but the lack of an expression for the normalizing  $a_t^*$  presents an additional technical difficulty. The result is the following theorem.

Theorem 3.2. Assume Massart's condition. Let  $d_k = \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{P}}[\ell_{t,k} - \ell_{t,k*}]$  and assume that  $\min_{k \neq k^*} d_k > 0$ . Using Tuning 2 in Figure 2, MUSCADA guarantees constant expected regret

$$
\underline {{\mathbf {E} _ {\mathbf {P}} \left[ R _ {t , k ^ {*}} \right] \leq \sum_ {k} f (d _ {k})}}, \quad \text {w h e r e} \quad f (d) = O \left(\frac {\sigma_ {\max } ^ {2}}{d} \ln \left(\frac {\sigma_ {\max } ^ {2}}{d ^ {2}}\right)\right) a s d \to 0.
$$

# 4 Optimism

Suppose that just before round  $t$ , we count on guesses  $\boldsymbol{m}_t$  for what  $\ell_t$  will be. Assume that  $\boldsymbol{m}_t$  is of the same scale as  $\ell_t$ , that is,  $|m_{t,k}| \leq \sigma_k$ . In particular, this entails that  $|\ell_{t,k} - m_{t,k}| \leq 2\sigma_k$ . A simple modification to the algorithm presented in Figure 1 puts these guesses to good use. These modifications allow for regret guarantees similar to those contained in Proposition 2.3, but in this case  $\Delta v_t^\circ \lesssim \mathrm{var}_{\tilde{\boldsymbol{w}}_t^\circ}(\ell_t - \bar{m}_t) / \langle \tilde{w}_t^\circ, \sigma^2 \rangle$ , where the superscript  $\circ$  signals the optimistic analogues of the quantities of MUSCADA. These modifications are shown in Figure 3, and the regret bounds in the following proposition (proofs in Appendix D).

Proposition 4.1. If  $t \mapsto v_t^\circ$  is the variance process defined by Optimistic MUSCADA in Figure 3, the same regret bounds presented Proposition 2.3 hold with two modifications:  $v_t^\circ$  instead of  $v_t$ ; and all scales doubled, that is,  $2\sigma$  instead of  $\sigma$ . Furthermore, for each  $t = 1, 2, \ldots, \Delta v_t^\circ \leq 4\mathrm{var}_{\tilde{\boldsymbol{w}}_t^\circ}(\ell_t - \boldsymbol{m}_t) / \langle \tilde{\boldsymbol{w}}_t^\circ, \boldsymbol{\sigma}^2 \rangle \leq 4t$ , where  $\tilde{w}_{t,k}^\circ \propto w_{t,k}^\circ \eta_{t-1,k}$ .

1' Compute the guess  $m_t$  and play

$$
\boldsymbol{w}_{t}^{\circ} = \operatorname *{arg  min}_{\boldsymbol {w}\in \mathcal{P}(K)}\langle \boldsymbol {w},\boldsymbol{L}_{t - 1} + \boldsymbol{m}_{t} + \boldsymbol{\mu}_{t - 1}\rangle -D_{\boldsymbol{\eta}_{t - 1}}(\boldsymbol {w},\boldsymbol {u})
$$

3' Let  $\Delta v_t^\circ$  be the value  $\Delta v^{\circ} \geq 0$  such that

$$
\Phi \left(\boldsymbol {R} _ {t} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t - 1} - \boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t - 1} \sigma^ {2} \Delta v ^ {\circ}, \boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t - 1}\right) = \Phi \left(\boldsymbol {R} _ {t - 1} + \langle \boldsymbol {w} _ {t} ^ {\circ}, \boldsymbol {m} _ {t} \rangle - \boldsymbol {m} _ {t} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t - 1}, \boldsymbol {\eta} _ {t - 1}\right). \tag {12}
$$

Tuning 1' and Tuning 2' As in Figure 2 but with halved starting learning rate  $\eta_{0,k} = \frac{1}{4\sigma_{\max}}$

# 5 Computation

Two computations need to be carried out. We now argue that both can be executed to machine precision in time  $O(K)$  per round. First, computing the weights (5) given the losses  $L_{t-1}$  and correction terms  $\mu_{t-1}$  can be reduced, by Lemma F.6, to a single scalar convex minimization problem. Cancelling the derivative amounts to searching for the normalizing offset  $a$ . Using binary search to machine precision takes  $O(K)$  time per round. Notice that this also allows us to compute the potential value. Second, computing the variance contribution (6). For this, it is easiest is to observe that the right-hand-side of (6) is decreasing in  $\Delta v_t$ . Since the potential can be computed in  $O(K)$  time, we can use an outer binary search to compute  $\Delta v_t$  to machine precision in  $O(K)$  time as well. We may also employ Newton's method because both problems require finding a root of a convex function. When deferring to a convex optimisation library, a convenient expression may be the jointly convex minimization form (see Lemma F.6)

$$
\Delta v _ {t} = \inf  _ {a, \Delta v} \Delta v \quad \text {s u b j e c t t o} \quad a + \sum_ {k \in K} w _ {t, k} \frac {\mathrm {e} ^ {\eta_ {t - 1 , k} (\langle \boldsymbol {w} _ {t} , \ell_ {t} \rangle - \ell_ {t , k} - a) - \eta_ {t - 1 , k} ^ {2} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} \Delta v} - 1}{\eta_ {t - 1 , k}} \leq 0.
$$

# 6 Experiments on Synthetic Data

We investigate the performance of our multiscale method on two kinds of examples. The results are shown in Figure 4, with full details in Appendix A. Firstly, we compared hard vs easy Massart i.i.d. stochastic data (details in Appendix A.1). We witnessed constant regret for the easy data. Secondly, we study an application to multiscale zero-sum games, where the payoff matrix is unknown, but row and column scales are available and very different. As detailed in Appendix A.2, we run two instances of appropriately tuned Optimistic MUSCADA against each other. In the experiment, the pair of time-average iterates converges to the saddle point, with a sub-optimality gap of order  $\sigma_{\mathrm{real}} / t$  instead of the worst-case  $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}} / t$ , where  $\sigma_{\mathrm{real}}$  is the maximum range measured only on the support of the saddle point. In Appendix A.2 we conjecture that this rate holds for any such game, and prove a weaker result: without optimism the slower but scale-adaptive  $\sigma_{\mathrm{real}} / \sqrt{t}$  rate is achieved.

Figure 4: Left: Empirical mean and quartiles of 2000 realizations of the regret  $t \mapsto \mathcal{R}_t$  of MUSCADA. For easy i.i.d. Massart distribution, the regret is constant; for a hard distribution without a gap,  $\Omega(\sqrt{t})$ . Right: Optimistic MUSCADA (red solid line) achieves an iterate average saddle point gap of  $\sigma_{\mathrm{real}} / t$  where  $\sigma_{\mathrm{real}} = \sigma_{\mathrm{max}} / 100$  is the relevant scale of the Nash equilibrium. Other methods scale as  $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}$ .

# 7 Discussion

We developed a new algorithm for multiscale online learning that is both worst-case safe and achieves constant pseudoregret in stochastic lucky cases. Our method is an refinement of the Follow the Regularized Leader template with a weighted entropy. The main innovation is in the correction terms added to the losses, which are the tightest the technique admits. This suggests that these variance-like terms are in fact intrinsic to the problem of obtaining scale-dependent regret bounds. Lastly, we relate this newfound variance to the variance asked for by Freund [2016], and state an open problem.

Quantile Bounds, and on Solving Freund's Problem. Freund [2016] posed the question of whether quantile adaptivity and variance adaptivity are compatible. That is, whether one can have  $\langle \pmb{p},\pmb{R}_t\rangle \leq \sqrt{D(\pmb{p},\pmb{u})\sum_{s\leq t}\mathrm{var}_{\pmb{w}_s}(\ell_s)}$  for all comparator distributions  $\pmb {p}\in \mathcal{P}(K)$  simultaneously. In the same-scale uniform-prior case,  $\Delta v_{t}$  is bounded by a small multiple of  $\mathrm{var}_{\pmb{w}_t}(\ell_t)$  [De Rooij et al., 2014]. However, our tuning of  $\eta_{t}$  does not yield quantile bounds. These can, however, be added employing a now standard method pioneered by Koolen and Van Erven [2015]. Namely, instead of only including every expert with a private learning rate tuned to its prior complexity level (the typical  $\ln K$  or  $-\ln \pi_{k}$  term), we will include many copies of each expert, each with a learning rate tuned to some smaller complexity level. We then start from (7) with comparator distribution  $\pmb{p}$  concentrated on the  $\epsilon$  quantile of interest, and carry out all future steps (from Proposition 2.2 on), ending up with the quantile regret bound  $\langle \pmb {p},\pmb {R}_t\rangle \leq \max_{k:p_k > 0}\sigma_k\sqrt{v_t(\ln C + D_{\eta_0}(\pmb{p},\pmb{u}))}$  where  $C$  is the number of learning rates thus created. As these learning rates can be exponentially spaced in an interval of width  $\ln K$ ,  $C$  is of order  $\ln \ln K$ . Have we solved Freund's problem? For our notion of variance,  $v_{t}$  which we believe our results suggest is a rather useful notion, the answer is yes. However, to relate  $\Delta v_{t}$  to  $\mathrm{var}_{\pmb{w}_t}(\ell_t)$ , we incur a multiplicative ratio  $\eta_{t,\max} / \eta_{t,\min}$ , which, for the quantile case, is of order  $\sqrt{\ln K}$ , turning the prior-in-the-square-root bound into a prior-outside-the-square-root bound. This was already trivially achievable by not tuning  $\eta$  to the prior complexities at all. Note that this problem is even present when  $K$  is fixed while  $t$  grows, which is narrowly outside the scope of the recent impossibility results of Marinov and Zimmert [2021]. All in all, we believe we understand in yet another way why Freund's problem is hard, and we present a desirable multiscale alternative.

Open Problem Our ability to incorporate an arbitrary prior suggests that the results should extend to countably many experts. However, the current techniques do break down. When  $\max_{k\in \mathbb{N}}\sigma_k < \infty$  MUSCADA with Tuning 1 (if  $\inf_{k\in \mathbb{N}}\sigma_k > 0$ ) or Tuning 2 would still deliver the worst-case bound. Yet our luckiness result currently requires  $\max_{k,l,t}\frac{\eta_{t,k}}{\eta_{t,l}\sigma_l^2} < \infty$ . Even with a common scale  $\sigma$ , this is never the case due to the dependence of  $\pmb{\eta}_t$  on the necessarily decreasing prior  $\pi$ . Is luckiness actually possible? For example in the online learning analogue of the elegant challenge example presented by Talagrand [2014, Chapter 2].
