# ABSTRACT

Saliency methods can make deep neural network predictions more interpretable by identifying a set of critical features in an input sample, such as pixels that contribute most strongly to a prediction made by an image classifier. Unfortunately, recent evidence suggests that many saliency methods poorly perform, especially in situations where gradients are saturated, inputs contain adversarial perturbations, or predictions rely upon inter-feature dependence. To address these issues, we propose a framework that improves the robustness of saliency methods by following a two-step procedure. First, we introduce a perturbation mechanism that subtly varies the input sample without changing its intermediate representations. Using this approach, we can gather a corpus of perturbed data samples while ensuring that the perturbed and original input samples follow the same distribution. Second, we compute saliency maps for the perturbed samples and propose a new method to aggregate saliency maps. With this design, we offset the gradient saturation influence upon interpretation. From a theoretical perspective, we show that the aggregated saliency map not only captures inter-feature dependence but, more importantly, is robust against previously described adversarial perturbation methods. Following our theoretical analysis, we present experimental results suggesting that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, our saliency method outperforms existing methods, in a variety of applications.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep neural networks (DNNs) deliver remarkable performance in an increasingly wide range of application domains, but they often do so in an inscrutable fashion, delivering predictions without accompanying explanations. In a practical setting such as automated analysis of pathology images, if a patient sample is classified as malignant, then the physician will want to know which parts of the image contribute to this diagnosis. Thus, in general, a DNN that delivers interpretations alongside its predictions will enhance the credibility and utility of its predictions for end users (Lipton, 2016).

In this paper, we focus on a popular branch of explanation methods, often referred to as saliency methods, which aim to find input features (e.g., image pixels or words) that strongly influence the network predictions (Simonyan et al., 2013; Selvaraju et al., 2016; Binder et al., 2016; Shrikumar et al., 2017; Smilkov et al., 2017; Sundararajan et al., 2017; Ancona et al., 2018). Saliency methods typically rely on back-propagation from the network's output back to its input to assign a saliency score to individual features so that higher scores indicate higher importance to the output prediction. Despite attracting increasing attention, saliency methods suffer from several fundamental limitations:

- Gradient saturation (Sundararajan et al., 2017; Shrikumar et al., 2017; Smilkov et al., 2017) may lead to the problem that the gradients of important features have small magnitudes, breaking down the implicit assumption that important features, in general, correspond to large gradients. This issue can be triggered when the DNN outputs are flattened in the vicinity of important features.  
- Importance isolation (Singla et al., 2019) refers to the problem that gradient-based saliency methods evaluate the feature importance in an isolated fashion, implicitly assuming that the other features are fixed.  
- Perturbation sensitivity (Ghorbani et al., 2017; Kindermans et al., 2017; Levine et al., 2019) refers to the observation that even imperceivable, random perturbations or a simple shift transformation of the input data may lead to a large change in the resulting saliency scores.

In this paper, we tackle these limitations by proposing a decoy-enhanced saliency score. At a high level, our method generates the saliency score of an input by aggregating the saliency scores of multiple perturbed copies of this input. Specifically, given an input sample of interest, our method first generates a population of perturbed samples, referred to as decoys, that perfectly mimic the neural network's intermediate representation of the original input. These decoys are used to model the variation of an input sample originating from either sensor noise or adversarial attacks. The decoy construction procedure draws inspiration from the knockoffs, proposed recently by Barber & Candès (2015) in the setting of error-controlled feature selection, where the core idea is to generate knockoff features that perfectly mimic the empirical dependence structure among the original features.

In brief, the current paper makes three primary contributions. First, we propose a framework to perturb input samples to produce corresponding decoys that preserve the input distribution, in the sense that the intermediate representations of the original input data and the decoys are indistinguishable. We formulate decoy generation as an optimization problem, applicable to diverse deep neural network architectures. Second, we develop a decoy-enhanced saliency score by aggregating the saliency maps of generated decoys. By design, this score naturally offsets the impact of gradient saturation. From a theoretical perspective, we show how the proposed score can simultaneously reflect the joint effects of other dependent features and achieve robustness to adversarial perturbations. Third, we demonstrate empirically that the decoy-enhanced saliency score outperforms existing saliency methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, on three real-world applications. We also quantify our method's advantage over existing saliency methods in terms of robustness against various adversarial attacks.

# 2 RELATED WORK

A variety of saliency methods have been proposed in the literature. Some, such as edge detectors and Guided Backpropagation (Springenberg et al., 2014) are independent from the predictive model (Nie et al., 2018; Adebayo et al., 2018). Others are designed only for specific architectures (i.e., GradCAM (Selvaraju et al., 2016) for CNNs, DeConvNet for CNNs with ReLU activations (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014)). In this paper, instead of exhaustively evaluating all saliency methods, we apply our method to the three saliency methods that do depend on the predictor (i.e., passing the sanity checks in Adebayo et al. (2018) and Sixt et al. (2020)) and are applicable to diverse DNN architectures:

- The vanilla gradient method (Simonyan et al., 2013) simply calculates the gradient of the class score with respect to the input  $\mathbf{x}$ , which is defined as  $E_{\text{grad}}(\mathbf{x}; F^c) = \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} F^c(\mathbf{x})$ .  
- The SmoothGrad method (Smilkov et al., 2017) seeks to reduce noise in the saliency map by averaging over explanations of the noisy copies of an input, defined as  $E_{sg}(\mathbf{x};F^c) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}E_{grad}(\mathbf{x} + g_i;F^c)$  with noise vectors  $g_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ .  
- The integrated gradient method  ${}^{2}$  (Sundararajan et al., 2017) starts from a baseline input  ${\mathbf{x}}^{0}$  and sums over the gradient with respect to scaled versions of the input ranging from the baseline to the observed input, defined as  ${E}_{ig}\left( {\mathbf{x};{F}^{c}}\right)  = \left( {\mathbf{x} - {\mathbf{x}}^{0}}\right)  \times  {\int }_{0}^{1}{\nabla }_{\mathbf{x}}{F}^{c}\left( {{\mathbf{x}}^{0} + \alpha \left( {\mathbf{x} - {\mathbf{x}}^{0}}\right) }\right) d\alpha$  .

We do not empirically compare to several other categories of methods. Counterfactual-based methods work under the same setup as saliency methods, providing explanations for the predictions of a pretrained DNN model (Sturmfels et al., 2020). These methods identify the important subregions within an input image by perturbing the subregions (by adding noise, rescaling (Sundararajan et al., 2017), blurring (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017), or inpainting (Chang et al., 2019)) and measuring the resulting changes in the predictions (Ribeiro et al., 2016; Lundberg & Lee, 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Dabkowski & Gal, 2017; Chang et al., 2019; Yousefzadeh & O'Leary, 2019; Goyal et al., 2019). Although these methods do identify meaningful subregions in practice, they exhibit several limitations. First, counterfactual-based methods implicitly assume that regions containing the object most contribute to the prediction (Fan et al., 2017). However, Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. (2017) showed that counterfactual-based methods are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which force these methods to output unrelated background rather than the meaningful objects as important subregions.

Second, the counterfactual images may be potentially far away from the training distribution, causing ill-defined classifier behavior (Burns et al., 2019; Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019).

In addition to these limitations, counterfactual-based methods and our decoy-based method are fundamentally different in three ways. First, the former seeks the minimum set of features to exclude in order to minimize the prediction score or to include in order to maximize the prediction score (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017), whereas our approach aims to characterize the influence of each feature on the prediction score. Second, counterfactual-based methods explicitly consider the decision boundary by comparing each image to the closest image on the other side of the boundary. In contrast, the proposed method only considers the decision boundary implicitly by calculating the gradient's variants. Third, unlike counterfactual images, which could potentially be out-of-distribution, decoys are plausibly constructed in the sense that their intermediate representations are indistinguishable from the original input data by design. Because of these limitations and differences, we do not compare our method with counterfactual-based methods.

In addition to saliency methods and counterfactual-based methods, several other types of interpretation methods have been proposed that either aim for a different goal or have a different setup. For example, recent research (e.g., Ribeiro et al. (2016); Lundberg & Lee (2017); Chen et al. (2018; 2019b)) designed techniques to explain a black-box model, where the model's internal weights are inaccessible. Koh & Liang (2017) and some follow-up work (Yeh et al., 2018; Koh et al., 2019) tried to find the training points that are most influential for a given test sample. Some other efforts have been made to train a more interpretable DNN classifier (Fan et al., 2017; Zolna et al., 2019; Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2018; Toneva & Wehbe, 2019), synthesize samples that represent the model predictions (Ghorbani et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019a)), or identifying noise-tolerant features (Ikeno & Hara, 2018; Schulz et al., 2020). However, due to the task and setup differences, we do not consider these methods in this paper.

# 3 METHODS

# 3.1 PROBLEM SETUP

Consider a multi-label classification task in which a pre-trained neural network model implements a function  $F\colon \mathbb{R}^d\mapsto \mathbb{R}^C$  that maps from the given input  $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^d$  to  $C$  predicted classes. The score for each class  $c\in \{1,\dots ,C\}$  is  $F^{c}(\mathbf{x})$ , and the predicted class is the one with maximum score, i.e.,  $\arg \max_{c\in \{1,\dots ,C\}}F^{c}(\mathbf{x})$ . A saliency method aims to assign to each feature a saliency score, encoded in a saliency map  $E(\mathbf{x};F^{c}): \mathbb{R}^{d}\mapsto \mathbb{R}^{d}$ , in which the features with higher scores represent higher "importance" relative to the final prediction.

Given a pre-trained neural network model  $F$  with  $L$  layers, an input  $\mathbf{x}$ , and a saliency method  $E$  such that  $E(\mathbf{x}; F)$  is a saliency map of the same dimensions as  $\mathbf{x}$ , the proposed scores can be obtained in two steps: generating decoys and aggregating the saliency maps of the decoys.

# 3.2 DECOY DEFINITION

Say that  $F_{\ell}:\mathbb{R}^{d}\mapsto \mathbb{R}^{d_{\ell}}$  is the function instantiated by the given network, which maps from an input  $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^d$  to its intermediate representation  $F_{\ell}(\mathbf{x})\in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\ell}}$  at layer  $\ell \in \{1,2,\dots ,L\}$ . A vector  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}\in \mathbb{R}^d$  is said to be a decoy of  $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^d$  at a specified layer  $\ell$  if the following swappable condition is satisfied:

$$
F _ {\ell} (\mathbf {x}) = F _ {\ell} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {\operatorname {s w a p} (\tilde {\mathbf {x}}, \mathcal {K})}\right), \text {f o r s w a p p a b l e f e t a r e s} \mathcal {K} \subset \{1, \dots , d \}. \tag {1}
$$

Here, the swap  $(\tilde{\mathbf{x}},\mathcal{K})$  operation swaps features between  $\mathbf{x}$  and  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$  based on the elements in  $\mathcal{K}$ . In this work,  $\mathcal{K}$  represents a small meaningful feature set, which represents a small region/segment in an image or a group of words (embeddings) in a sentence. Take an image recognition task for example. Assume  $\mathcal{K} = \{10\}$  and  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$  is a zero matrix, then  $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{swap}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}},\mathcal{K})}$  indicates a new image that is identical to  $\mathbf{x}$  except that the tenth pixel is set to zero. Using the swappable condition, we aim to ensure that the original image  $\mathbf{x}$  and its decoy  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$  are indistinguishable in terms of the intermediate representation at layer  $\ell$ . Note in particular that the construction of decoys relies solely on the first  $\ell$  layers of the neural network  $F_{1}, F_{2}, \dots, F_{\ell}$  and is independent of the succeeding layers  $F_{\ell + 1}, \dots, F_{L}$ . As such,  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$  is conditionally independent of the classification task  $F(\mathbf{x})$  given the input  $\mathbf{x}$ ; i.e.,  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}} \perp F(\mathbf{x})|_{\mathbf{x}}$ .

# 3.3 DECOY GENERATION

To identify decoys satisfying the swappable condition, we solve the following optimization problem:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {m a x i m i z e} _ {\tilde {\mathbf {x}} \in [ \mathbf {x} _ {\min }, \mathbf {x} _ {\max } ] ^ {d}} \left\| \left(\left(\tilde {\mathbf {x}} - \mathbf {x}\right) \cdot s\right) ^ {+} \right\| _ {1}, \\ \begin{array}{l} \text {s . t .} \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \| F _ {\ell} (\tilde {\mathbf {x}}) - F _ {\ell} (\mathbf {x}) \| _ {\infty} \leq \epsilon , \\ (\tilde {\mathbf {x}} - \mathbf {x}) \circ (1 - \mathcal {M}) = 0 \end{array} \right. \end{array} \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Here,  $(\cdot)^{+} = \max (\cdot ,0)$ , and the operators  $\| \cdot \| _1$  and  $\| \cdot \|_{\infty}$  correspond to the  $L_{1}$  and  $L_{\infty}$  norms, respectively.  $\mathcal{M}\in \{0,1\} ^d$  is a specified binary mask. And the value of each feature in the decoy  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$  is restricted to lie in a legitimate value range i.e.,  $[\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{min}},\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{max}}]$  (e.g., the pixel value should lie in [0, 255]). We impose the constraint  $\| F_{\ell}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}) - F_{\ell}(\mathbf{x})\|_{\infty}\leq \epsilon$ , which ensures that the generated decoy satisfies the swappable condition described in Eqn. 1. It should be noted that we take  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$  and  $\mathbf{x}$  to be indistinguishable except for the swappable features indicated by the mask (i.e.,  $\mathbf{x}_{swap}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}},\mathcal{K}) = \tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ ).

As is shown later in Section 3.4, our decoy-enhanced saliency score is defined to capture the empirical range of the decoy saliencies. Here, we first need to estimate the upper/ lower ends of the legitimate decoys. To achieve this, in Eqn. 2, we maximize the deviation between  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$  and  $\mathbf{x}$  from both the positive and negative directions, i.e.,  $s = +1$  and  $s = -1$ . By using this objective function, for each mask  $\mathcal{M}$ , we can compute two decoys—one for the positive deviation (i.e.,  $s = +1$ ) and the other for the negative one (i.e.,  $s = -1$ ). For details of the optimization procedure, see Section A6.

# 3.4 DECOY-ENHANCED SALIENCY SCORES

Given an input sample  $\mathbf{x}$  and a swappable patch with size  $K$ , we obtain  $n$  unique masks by sliding the swappable patch across the input with a certain stride. Then, we can generate  $2n$  decoys for that sample, denoted  $\{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^1,\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^2,\dots ,\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{2n}\}$ . For these decoys, we can then apply a given saliency method  $E$  to yield the corresponding decoy saliency maps  $\{E(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^1;F),E(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^2;F),\dots ,E(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{2n};F)\}$ . With these decoy saliency maps in hand, for each feature  $\mathbf{x}_i$  in  $\mathbf{x}$ , we can characterize its saliency score variation by using a population of saliency scores  $\tilde{E}_i = \{E(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^1;F^c)_i,E(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^2;F^c)_i,\dots ,E(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{2n};F^c)_i\}$ . In this work, we define the decoy-enhanced saliency score  $Z_{i}$  for each feature  $\mathbf{x}_i$  as

$$
Z _ {i} = \max  \left(\tilde {E} _ {i}\right) - \min  \left(\tilde {E} _ {i}\right). \tag {3}
$$

Here,  $Z_{i}$  is determined by the empirical range of the decoy saliency scores. Ideally, important features will have large values and unimportant ones will have small values. Note that the proposed method is designed specifically for nonlinear models in need of interpretation. As is discussed in Section A7, it exhibits ill-defined on linear models. It should also be noted that by sliding the swappable patch across the input and ensembling the obtained decoy-enhanced saliency maps, we could capture the saliency of each feature. The motivations of manipulating at a patch level rather than the entire input are capturing the local dependency structure and enabling batch operations for better efficiency.

# 3.5 THEORETICAL INSIGHTS

In this section, we analyze the saliency score method in a theoretical fashion. In particular, we take a convolutional neural network with the ReLU activation function as an example to discuss why the proposed interpretation method can account for inter-feature dependence while also improving explanatory robustness. It should be noted that, while we conduct our theoretical analysis in the setting of CNNs with a specific activation function, the conclusions drawn from the theoretical analysis can easily be extended to other feed-forward neural architectures and other activation functions (e.g., sigmoid and tanh). For analysis of other neural architectures, see Section A9.

Consider a CNN with  $L$  hidden blocks, with each layer  $\ell$  containing a convolutional layer with a filter of size  $\sqrt{s_{\ell}} \times \sqrt{s_{\ell}}$  and a max pooling layer with pooling size  $\sqrt{s_{\ell}} \times \sqrt{s_{\ell}}$ . (We set the pooling size the same as the kernel size in each block for simplicity.) The input to this CNN is  $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , unrolled from a  $\sqrt{d} \times \sqrt{d}$  matrix. Similarly, we also unroll each convolutional filter into  $\mathbf{g}_{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{s_{\ell}}$ , where  $\mathbf{g}_{\ell}$  is indexed as  $(\mathbf{g}_{\ell})_j$  for  $j \in \mathcal{I}_{\ell}$ . Here,  $\mathcal{I}_{\ell}$  corresponds to the index shift in matrix form from the top-left to bottom-right element. For example, a  $3 \times 3$  convolutional filter (i.e.,  $s_{\ell} = 9$ ) is indexed

by  $\mathcal{J}_{\ell} = \left\{-\sqrt{d} - 1, -\sqrt{d}, -\sqrt{d} + 1, -1, 0, 1, \sqrt{d} - 1, \sqrt{d}, \sqrt{d} + 1\right\}$ . The output of the network is the probability vector  $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^C$  generated by the softmax function, where  $C$  is the total number of classes. Such a network can be represented as

$$
\mathbf {m} _ {\ell} = \operatorname {p o o l} \left(\operatorname {r e l u} \left(\mathbf {g} _ {\ell} * \mathbf {m} _ {\ell - 1}\right)\right) \text {f o r} \ell = 1, 2, 3, \dots , L,
$$

$$
\mathbf {o} = \mathbf {W} _ {L + 1} ^ {T} \mathbf {m} _ {L} + \mathbf {b} _ {L + 1}, \tag {4}
$$

$$
\mathbf {p} = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} (\mathbf {o}),
$$

where  $\mathrm{relu}(\cdot)$  and  $\mathrm{pool}(\cdot)$  indicate the ReLU and pooling operators,  $\mathbf{m}_{\ell}\in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\ell}}$  is the output of the block  $\ell (\mathbf{m}_0 = \mathbf{x})$ , and  $(\mathbf{g}_{\ell}* \mathbf{m}_{\ell -1})\in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\ell -1}}$  represents a convolutional operation on that block. We assume for simplicity that the convolution retains the input shape.

Consider an input  $\mathbf{x}$  and its decoy  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ , generated by swapping features in  $\mathcal{K}$ . For each feature  $i \in \mathcal{K}$ , we have the following theorem for the decoy-enhanced saliency score  $Z_{i}$ :

Theorem 1. In the aforementioned setting,  $Z_{i}$  is bounded by

$$
\left| Z _ {i} - \frac {1}{2} \left| \sum_ {k \in \mathcal {K}} \left(\tilde {\mathbf {x}} _ {k} ^ {+} - \tilde {\mathbf {x}} _ {k} ^ {-}\right) \left(\mathbf {H} _ {\mathbf {x}}\right) _ {k, i} \right| \right| \leq C _ {1}. \tag {5}
$$

Here,  $C_1 > 0$  is a bounded constant, and  $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{x}}$  is the Hessian of  $F^c (\mathbf{x})$  on  $\mathbf{x}$  where  $(\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{x}})_{i,k} = \frac{\partial^2F^c}{\partial\mathbf{x}_i\partial\mathbf{x}_k}$ .  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{+}$  and  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{-}$  refer to the decoy that maximizes and minimizes  $E(\tilde{\mathbf{x}};F^c)$ , respectively. See Section A7 for the proof. Theorem 1 implies that the proposed saliency score is determined by the second-order Hessian  $((\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{x}})_{i,k})$  in the same swappable feature set. The score explicitly models the feature dependencies in the swappable feature set via this second-order Hessian, potentially capturing meaningful patterns such as edges, texture, etc.

In addition to enabling representation of inter-feature dependence, Theorem 1 sheds light on the robustness of the proposed saliency score against adversarial attack. To illustrate the robustness improvement of our method, we introduce the following proposition. The proof of this proposition as well as in-depth analysis can be found in Section A8.

Proposition 1. Given an input  $\mathbf{x}$  and the corresponding adversarial sample  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ , if both  $|\mathbf{x}_i - \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i| \leq C_2\delta_i$  and  $|\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i - \tilde{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}_i| \leq C_2\delta_i$  can obtain where  $C_2 > 0$  is a bounded constant, then the following relation can be guaranteed.

$$
\left| \left(Z _ {\hat {\mathbf {x}}}\right) _ {i} - \left(Z _ {\mathbf {x}}\right) _ {i} \right| \leq \left| E \left(\hat {\mathbf {x}}, F\right) _ {i} - E (\mathbf {x}, F) _ {i} \right|. \tag {6}
$$

Given an adversarial sample  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$  (i.e., the perturbed  $\mathbf{x}$ ), we say a saliency method is not robust against  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$  if the deviation of the corresponding explanation  $\delta_{i} = |E(\hat{\mathbf{x}},F)_{i} - E(\mathbf{x},F)_{i}|$  (for all  $i\in \{1,2,\dots ,d\}$ ) is large. According to the proposition above, we can easily discover that the deviation of our decoy-enhanced saliency score is always no larger than that of other saliency methods when a certain condition is satisfied. This indicates that, when the condition holds, our saliency method can guarantee a stronger resistance to the adversarial perturbation. To ensure the conditions  $|\mathbf{x}_i - \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i|\leq C_2\delta_i$  and  $\left|\hat{\mathbf{x}}_i - \tilde{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}_i\right|\leq C_2\delta_i$  obtain, we can further introduce the corresponding condition as a constraint to Eqn. 2. In the following section, without further clarification, the saliency scores used in our evaluation are all derived with this constraint imposed.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform extensive experiments on deep learning models that target three tasks: image classification, sentiment analysis, and network intrusion detection. The performance of our approach is assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results show that our proposed method identifies intuitively more coherent saliency maps than the state-of-the-art saliency methods alone. The method also achieves quantitatively better alignment to truly important features and demonstrates stronger robustness to adversarial manipulation. The description of the datasets and experimental setup can be found in Section A10.

(B) Fidelity comparison of original saliencies (i.e., "Without decoys"), our method (i.e., "Decoys w/ range aggregation"), and its alternatives: replacing the decoy generation (Eqn. 2) with constant perturbation (i.e., "Constant-perturbation w/ range aggregation"); replacing the decoy aggregation (Eqn. 3) with mean aggregation (i.e., "Decoys w/ mean aggregation").

# 4.1 SALIENCY BENCHMARK

As mentioned in Section 2, we apply our decoy enhancement method to three saliency methods: vanilla gradient, SmoothGrad, and integrated gradient. In each case, the decoy-enhanced saliency scores are post-processed in the following way before qualitative and quantitative evaluations. First, we follow the existing methods (Simonyan et al., 2013) and compute the absolute saliency scores. For images, to obtain a single importance score for each pixel, we use the maximum absolute saliency score across all color channels. To avoid outlier features with extremely high saliency values leading to almost zero saliency scores for the other features, we then winsorized outlier saliency values to a relatively high value (the  $95^{\text{th}}$  percentile), as suggested by Smilkov et al. (2017) before linearly scaling to the range  $[0, 1]$ . To demonstrate that all three methods, when enhanced with decoys, still depend on the predictor, we carry out a sanity check on the ImageNet dataset. The results show that our decoy enhanced-saliency methods pass the sanity check (see Section A11 for details).

# 4.2 PERFORMANCE IN VARIOUS APPLICATIONS

To comprehensively evaluate our proposed approach against the baselines mentioned above, we focus on two criteria. First, we aim to achieve qualitative coherence of the identified saliency map. Intuitively, we prefer a saliency method that highlights features that align closely with the predictions (e.g., highlights the object of interest in an image or the words indicating the sentiment of the sentence). Second, to quantify the correctness of the saliency maps produced by the corresponding saliency method, we use the fidelity metric (Dabkowski & Gal, 2017), defined as  $SF(E(\cdot; F^c), \mathbf{x}) = -\log \frac{F^c(E(\mathbf{x}; F^c) \circ \mathbf{x})}{F^c(E(\mathbf{x}; F^c) \circ \mathbf{x})}$ , where  $c$  indicates the predicted class of input  $\mathbf{x}$ , and  $E(\mathbf{x}; F^c)$  is the normalized saliency map described above.  $E(\mathbf{x}; F^c) \circ \mathbf{x}$  performs entry-wise multiplication between  $E(\mathbf{x}; F^c)$  and  $\mathbf{x}$ , encoding the overlap between the object of interest and the concentration of the saliency map. The rationale behind this metric is as follows. By viewing the saliency score of the feature as its contribution to the predicted class, a good saliency method will weight important features more highly than less important ones and thus give rise to higher predicted class scores and lower metric values. Note that we subtract the mean saliency  $\overline{E(\mathbf{x}; F^c)}$  to eliminate the influence of bias in  $E(\mathbf{x}; F^c)$  and exclude trivial cases such as  $E(\mathbf{x}; F^c) = \mathbf{1}$ .

# 4.2.1 PERFORMANCE ON THE IMAGENET DATASET

We applied our decoy-enhanced saliency score to randomly sampled images from the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015), with a pretrained VGG16 model (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014).

![](images/6afd8be69445e7213526020626e7da7de0ffaa80a6b4188082b9df20995e2e6a.jpg)

See Section A12 for applicability of our method to diverse CNN architectures such as AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and ResNet (He et al., 2016). The  $3 \times 3$  image patches are treated as swappable features in generating decoys.

A side-by-side comparison (Figure 1(A)) suggests that decoys consistently help to reduce noise and produce more visually coherent saliency maps. For example, the original integrated gradient method highlights the region of dog head in a scattered format. In contrast, the decoy-enhanced integrated gradient method not only highlights the missing body but also identifies the dog head with more details such as ears, cheek,and nose (See Section A18 for more visualization examples). The visual coherence is also quantitatively supported by the saliency fidelity (Figure 1(B) blue and orange bars.).

To further evaluate the necessity of the two steps (i.e., decoy generation and aggregation) in our method, we carried out a control experiment by replacing either step with alternatives. Specifically, as alternatives to the decoy generation, we used an image in which all pixel values are replaced with a single mean pixel value. Regarding the decoy aggregation, we calculated the mean saliency score as the alternative. As shown in Figure 1(B) above, our method, which incorporate both steps, reports the best performance. This validates the effectiveness of each of our designs.

# 4.2.2 PERFORMANCE ON THE STANFORD SENTIMENT TREEBANK (SST) DATASET

We also applied our decoy-enhanced saliency score to randomly sampled sentences from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) (Russakovsky et al., 2015). We train a two-layer CNN (Kim, 2014) which takes the pretrained word embeddings as input (Pennington et al., 2014) (see A10 for experimental details). As suggested by Guan et al. (2019), the average saliency value of all dimensions of a word embedding is regarded as the word-level saliency value. The embeddings of the words are treated as swappable features when generating decoys.

As shown in Figure 2(A) and (B), a side-by-side comparison suggests that decoys consistently help to produce semantically more meaningful saliency maps. For example, in a sentence with negative sentiment, keywords associated with negation, such as 'no' and 'not', are more highlighted by decoy-enhanced saliency methods. The semantic coherence is also quantitatively supported by the saliency fidelity (Figure 2(C)). The constant-decoy (i.e., the mean embedding of all the sentences) baseline also achieves worse fidelity than the decoys generated by Eqn. 2. Note that other decoy proxies (e.g., random noise, blurring) are invalid for text data.

# 4.3 ROBUSTNESS TO ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS

Next we investigate the robustness of our method to adversarial manipulations of images. In particular, we focus on three popular adversarial attacks (Ghorbani et al., 2017): (1) the top- $k$  attack, which seeks to decrease the scores of the top  $k$  most important features, (2) the target attack, which aims to increase the importance of a pre-specified region in the input image, and (3) the mass-center attack, which aims to spatially change the center of mass of the original saliency map. Here, we specify the bottom-right  $4 \times 4$  region of the original image for the target attack and select  $k = 5000$  in the top- $k$  attack. We use the sensitivity metric (Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2018) to quantify the robustness of a saliency method  $E$  to adversarial attack, defined as  $SS(E(\cdot, F^c), \mathbf{x}, \hat{\mathbf{x}}) = \frac{||(E(\mathbf{x}, F^c) - E(\hat{\mathbf{x}}, F^c))||_2}{\|\mathbf{x} - \hat{\mathbf{x}}\|_2}$ ,

where  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$  is the perturbed image of  $\mathbf{x}$ . A small sensitivity value means that similar inputs do not lead to substantially different saliency maps.

As shown in Figure 3(A), a side-by-side comparison suggests that decoys consistently yield low sensitivity scores and help to produce more visually coherent saliency maps, mitigating the impact of various adversarial attacks. More examples can be found in Section A18. The visual coherence and robustness to adversarial attacks are also quantitatively supported by Figure  $3(\mathrm{B})\sim (\mathrm{D})$ . As is mentioned above, we also did experiments on a MLP trained with a network intrusion dataset and show the results in Section A13. The results are consistent with those on CNNs, which confirm our method's applicability to the widely-used feed-forward networks.

# 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this work, we propose a method for computing, from a given saliency method, decoy-enhanced saliency scores that yield more accurate and robust saliency maps. We formulate the decoy generation as an optimization problem, applicable to diverse deep neural network architecture. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method relative to three standard saliency methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, even in the presence of various adversarial perturbations to the image. From a theoretical perspective, by deriving a closed-form solution, we show that the proposed score can provably compensate for the limitations of existing saliency methods by reflecting the joint effects from other dependent features and maintaining robustness to adversarial perturbations.

Although decoy generation introduces extra computational overhead on top of existing saliency methods, the run time of generating one decoy is faster than existing saliency methods (See Section A15). Since decoy generation can run parallelly in a batch mode, the extra overhead does not jeopardize our method's application to large datasets. Our method has three hyperparameters: swappable feature size  $K$ , network layer  $\ell$ , and initial Lagrange multiplier  $\lambda$ . In Section A16, we show that our method is insensitive to the substantial variation of hyperparameters. We generate decoys by using Eqn. 2. While there are other widely used perturbation methods (e.g., random noise, blurring, and inpainting), they are not suitable for generating decoys. First, without ensuring the swappable condition in Eqn. 1, they cannot provide a theoretical guarantee for robustness improvement. Second, methods like blurring and inpainting are not well-defined for applications beyond computer vision.

This work points to several promising directions for future research. First, a possible extension is to customize our method to recurrent neural networks and to inputs with categorical/discrete features. Second, recent work (Bansal et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019c) shows that adversarial training can improve the interpretability of a DNN model. It is worth exploring whether our method could further enhance the quality of saliency maps derived from these adversarially retrained classifiers. A third promising direction could be reframing interpretability as hypothesis testing and using decoys to deliver a set of salient features, subject to false discovery rate control at some pre-specified level (Burns et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2018).
