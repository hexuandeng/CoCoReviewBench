# ABSTRACT

Extensive work has demonstrated that equivariant neural networks can significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization by enforcing an inductive bias in the network architecture. These applications typically assume that the domain symmetry is fully described by explicit transformations of the model inputs and outputs. However, many real-life applications contain only latent or partial symmetries which cannot be easily described by simple transformations of the input. In these cases, it is necessary to learn symmetry in the environment instead of imposing it mathematically on the network architecture. We discover, surprisingly, that imposing equivariance constraints that do not exactly match the domain symmetry is very helpful in learning the true symmetry in the environment. We differentiate between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints and show that while imposing incorrect symmetry can impede the model's performance, imposing extrinsic symmetry can actually improve performance. We demonstrate that an equivariant model can significantly outperform non-equivariant methods on domains with latent symmetries both in supervised learning and in reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation and control problems.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Recently, equivariant learning has shown great success in various machine learning domains like trajectory prediction (Walters et al., 2020), robotics (Simeonov et al., 2022), and reinforcement learning (Wang et al., 2022c). Equivariant networks (Cohen & Welling, 2016; 2017) can improve generalization and sample efficiency during learning by encoding task symmetries directly into the model structure. However, this requires problem symmetries to be perfectly known and modeled at design time – something that is sometimes problematic. It is often the case that the designer knows that a latent symmetry is present in the problem but cannot easily express how that symmetry acts in the input space. For example, Figure 2b is a rotation of Figure 2a. However, this is not a rotation of the image – it is a rotation of the objects present in the image when they are viewed from an oblique angle. In order to model this rotational symmetry, the designer must know the viewing angle and somehow transform the data or encode projective geometry into the model. This is difficult and it makes the entire approach less attractive. In this situation, the conventional wisdom would be to discard the model structure altogether since it is not fully known and to use an unconstrained model. Instead, we explore whether it is possible to benefit from equivariant models even when the way a symmetry acts on the problem input is not precisely known. We show empirically that this is indeed the case and that an inaccurate equivariant model is often better than a completely unstructured model. For example, suppose we want to model a function with the object-wise rotation symmetry expressed in Figure 2a and b. Notice that whereas it is difficult to encode the object-wise symmetry, it is easy to encode an image-wise symmetry because it involves simple image rotations. Although the image-wise symmetry model is imprecise in this situation, our experiments indicate that this imprecise model is still a much better choice than a completely unstructured model.

This paper makes three contributions. First, we define three different relationships between problem symmetry and model symmetry: correct equivariance, incorrect equivariance, and extrinsic equivariance. With incorrect equivariance, the model structure interferes with the modeling problem whereas with extrinsic equivariance, it may not. We theoretically demonstrate the upper bound performance for an incorrectly constrained equivariant model. Second, we empirically compare extrinsic and incorrect equivariance in a supervised learning task and show that a model with extrinsic

equivariance can improve performance compared with an unconstrained model. Finally, we explore this idea in a reinforcement learning context and show that an extrinsically constrained model can outperform state-of-the-art conventional CNN baselines.

Equivariant Neural Networks. Equivariant networks are first introduced as G-Convolution (Cohen & Welling, 2016) and Steerable CNN (Cohen & Welling, 2017; Weiler & Cesa, 2019; Cesa et al., 2021). Equivariant learning has been applied to various types of data including images (Weiler & Cesa, 2019), spherical data (Cohen et al., 2018), point clouds (Dym & Maron, 2020), sets Maron et al. (2020), and meshes (De Haan et al., 2020), and has shown great success in tasks including molecular dynamics (Anderson et al., 2019), particle physics (Bogatskiy et al., 2020), fluid dynamics (Wang et al., 2020), trajectory prediction (Walters et al., 2020), robotics (Simeonov et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022) and reinforcement learning (Wang et al., 2021; 2022c). Compared with the prior works that assume the domain symmetry is perfectly known, this work studies the effectiveness of equivariant networks in domains with latent symmetries.

Symmetric Representation Learning. Since latent symmetry is not expressable as a simple transformation of the input, equivariant networks can not be used in the standard way. Thus several works have turned to learning equivariant features which can be easily transformed. Park et al. (2022) learn an encoder which maps inputs to equivariant features which can be used by downstream equivariant layers. Quessard et al. (2020), Klee et al. (2022), and Marchetti et al. (2022) map 2D image inputs to elements of various groups including SO(3), allowing for disentanglement and equivariance constraints. Falorsi et al. (2018) use a homeomorphic VAE to perform the same task in an unsupervised manner. Dangovski et al. (2021) consider equivariant representations learned in a self-supervised manner using losses to encourage sensitivity or insensitivity to various symmetries. Zhou et al. (2020) and Dehmamy et al. (2021) assume no prior knowledge of the structure of symmetry in the domain and learn the symmetry transformations on inputs and latent features end-to-end with the task function. Our method may be considered as an example of symmetric representation learning which, unlike any of the above methods, uses an equivariant neural network as encoder.

Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning. One traditional solution for improving sample efficiency is to create additional samples using data augmentation (Krizhevsky et al., 2017). Recent works discover that simple image augmentations like random crop (Laskin et al., 2020b; Yarats et al., 2022) or random shift (Yarats et al., 2021) can improve the performance of reinforcement learning. Such image augmentation can be combined with contrastive learning (Oord et al., 2018) to achieve better performance (Laskin et al., 2020a; Zhan et al., 2020). Recently, many prior works have shown that equivariant methods can achieve tremendously high sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (van der Pol et al., 2020; Mondal et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; 2022c), and realize on-robot reinforcement learning (Zhu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a). However, recent equivariant reinforcement learning works are limited in fully equivariant domains. This paper extends the prior works by applying equivariant reinforcement learning to tasks with latent symmetries.

# 3 BACKGROUND

Equivariant Neural Networks. A function is equivariant if it respects symmetries of its input and output spaces. Specifically, a function  $f: X \to Y$  is equivariant with respect to a symmetry group  $G$  if it commutes with all transformations  $g \in G$ ,

$$
f \left(\rho_ {x} (g) x\right) = \rho_ {y} (g) f (x), \tag {1}
$$

where  $\rho_{x}$  and  $\rho_{y}$  are the representations of the group  $G$  that define how the group element  $g\in G$  acts on  $x\in X$  and  $x\in Y$ , respectively. An equivariant function is a mathematical way of expressing that  $f$  is symmetric with respect to  $G$ : if we evaluate  $f$  for differently transformed versions of the same input, we should obtain transformed versions of the same output.

In order to use an equivariant model, we generally require the symmetry group  $G$  and representation  $\rho_{x}$  to be known at design time. For example, in a convolutional model, this can be accomplished by

tying the kernel weights together so as to satisfy  $K(gy) = \rho_{out}(g)K(y)\rho_{in}(g)^{-1}$ , where  $\rho_{in}$  and  $\rho_{out}$  denote the representation of the group operator at the input and the output of the layer (Cohen et al., 2019). End-to-end equivariant models can be constructed by combining equivariant convolutional layers and equivariant activation functions. In order to leverage symmetry in this way, it is common to transform the input so that standard group representations work correctly, e.g., to transform an image to a top-down view so that image rotations correspond to object rotations.

Equivariant SAC. Equivariant SAC (Wang et al., 2022c) is a variation of SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) that constrains the actor to an equivariant function and the critic to an invariant function with respect to a group  $G$ . The policy is a network  $\pi : S \to A \times A_{\sigma}$ , where  $A_{\sigma}$  is the space of action standard deviations (SAC models a stochastic policy). It defines the group action on the output space of the policy network network  $\bar{a} \in A \times A_{\sigma}$  as:  $g\bar{a} = g(a_{\mathrm{equiv}}, a_{\mathrm{inv}}, a_{\sigma}) = (\rho_{\mathrm{equiv}}(g)a_{\mathrm{equiv}}, a_{\mathrm{inv}}, a_{\sigma})$ , where  $a_{\mathrm{equiv}} \in A_{\mathrm{equiv}}$  is the equivariant component in the action space,  $a_{\mathrm{inv}} \in A_{\mathrm{inv}}$  is the invariant component in the action space,  $a_{\sigma} \in A_{\sigma}$ ,  $g \in G$ . The actor network  $\pi$  is then defined to be a mapping  $s \mapsto \bar{a}$  that satisfies the following equivariance constraint:  $\pi(gs) = g(\pi(s)) = g\bar{a}$ . The critic is a  $Q$ -network  $q : S \times A \to \mathbb{R}$  that satisfies an invariant constraint:  $q(gs, ga) = q(s, a)$ .

# 4 LEARNING SYMMETRY USING OTHER SYMMETRIES

# 4.1 MODEL SYMMETRY VERSUS TRUE SYMMETRY

This paper focuses on tasks where the way in which the symmetry group operates on the input space is unknown. In this case the ground truth function  $f: X \to Y$  is equivariant with respect to a group  $G$  which acts on  $X$  and  $Y$  by  $\rho_x$  and  $\rho_y$  respectively. However, the action  $\rho_x$  on the input space is not known and may not be a simple or explicit map. Since  $\rho_x$  is unknown, we cannot pursue the strategy of learning  $f$  using an equivariant model class  $f_\phi$  constrained by  $\rho_x$ . As an alternative, we propose restricting to a model class  $f_\phi$  which satisfies equivariance with respect to a different group action  $\hat{\rho}_x$ , i.e.,  $f_\phi(\hat{\rho}_x(g)x) = \rho_y(g)f_\phi(x)$ . This paper tests the hypothesis that if the model is constrained to a symmetry class  $\hat{\rho}_x$  which is related to the true symmetry  $\rho_x$ , then it may help learn a model satisfying the true symmetry.

# 4.2 CORRECT,

INCORRECT, AND EXTRINSIC EQUIVARIANCE

Our findings show that the success of this strategy depends on how  $\hat{\rho}_x$  relates to the ground truth function  $f$  and its symmetry. We classify the model symmetry as correct equivariance, incorrect equivariance, or extrinsic equivariance with respect to the true function  $f$ . Cor

rect symmetry means that the model symmetry correctly reflects a symmetry present in the ground truth function  $f$ . An extrinsic symmetry may still aid learning whereas an incorrect symmetry is necessarily detrimental to learning. We illustrate the distinction with a classification example shown in Figure 1a. Let  $D \subseteq X$  be the support of the input distribution for  $f$ .

Definition 4.1. The action  $\hat{\rho}_x$  has correct equivariance with respect to  $f$  if  $\hat{\rho}_x(g)x\in D$  for all  $x\in D,g\in G$  and  $f(\hat{\rho}_x(g)x) = \rho_y(g)f(x)$ .

That is, the model symmetry preserves the input space  $D$  and  $f$  is equivariant with respect to it. For example, consider the action  $\hat{\rho}_x$  of the group  $G_1 = C_2$  acting on  $\mathbb{R}^2$  by reflection across the horizontal axis and  $\rho_y = 1$ , the trivial action fixing labels. Figure 1b shows the untransformed data  $x \in D$  as circles along the unit circle. The transformed data  $\hat{\rho}_x(g)x$  (shown as crosses) also lie on the unit circle, and hence the support  $D$  is reflection invariant. Moreover, the ground truth labels  $f(x)$  (shown as orange or blue) are preserved by this action.

Definition 4.2. The action  $\hat{\rho}_x$  has incorrect equivariance with respect to  $f$  if there exist  $x\in D$  and  $g\in G$  such that  $\hat{\rho}_x(g)x\in D$  but  $f(\hat{\rho}_x(g)x)\neq \rho_y(g)f(x)$

In this case, the model symmetry partially preserves the input distribution, but does not correctly preserve labels. In Figure 1c, the rotation group  $G_{2} = \langle \mathrm{Rot}_{\pi}\rangle$  maps the unit circle to itself, but the transformed data does not have the correct label. Thus, constraining the model  $f_{\phi}$  by  $f_{\phi}(\hat{\rho}_x(g)x) = f_{\phi}(x)$  will force  $f_{\phi}$  to mislabel data. In this example, for  $a = \sqrt{2}/2$ ,  $f(a,a) = \mathrm{ORANGE}$  and  $f(-a,-a) = \mathrm{BLUE}$ , however,  $f_{\phi}(a,a) = f_{\phi}(\mathrm{Rot}_{\pi}(a,a)) = f_{\phi}(-a,-a)$ .

Definition 4.3. The action  $\hat{\rho}_x$  has extrinsic equivariance with respect to  $f$  if for  $x\in D,\hat{\rho}_x(g)x\notin D$

Extrinsic equivariance is when the equivariant constraint in the equivariant network  $f_{\phi}$  enforces equivariance to out-of-distribution data. Since  $\hat{\rho}_{x}(g)x \notin D$ , the ground truth  $f(\hat{\rho}_{x}(g)x)$  is undefined. An example of extrinsic equivariance is given by the scaling group  $G_{3}$  shown in Figure 1d. For the data  $x \in D$ , enforcing scaling invariance  $f_{\phi}(\hat{\rho}_{x}(g)x) = f_{\phi}(x)$  where  $g \in G_{3}$  will not increase error, because the group transformed data (in crosses) are out of the distribution  $D$  of the input data shown in the grey ring. In fact, we hypothesize that such extrinsic equivariance may even be helpful for the network to learn the ground truth function. For example, in Figure 1d, the network can learn to classify all points on the left as blue and all points on the right as orange.

# 4.3 THEORETICAL UPPER BOUND ON ACCURACY FOR EQUIVARIANT MODELS WITH INCORRECT SYMMETRY

Consider a classification problem over the set  $X$  with finitely many classes  $Y$ . Let  $G$  be a finite group acting on  $X$ . Consider a model  $f_{\phi} \colon X \to Y$  with incorrect equivariance constrained to be invariant to  $G$ . In this case the points in a single orbit  $\{gx : g \in G\}$  must all be assigned the same label  $f_{\phi}(gx) = y$ . However these points may have different ground truth labels. We classify how bad this situation is by measuring  $p(x)$ , the proportion of ground truth labels in the orbit of  $x$  which are equal to the majority label. Let  $c_p$  be the fraction of points  $x \in X$  which have consensus proportion  $p(x) = p$ .

Proposition 4.1. The accuracy of  $f_{\phi}$  has upper bound  $\mathrm{acc}(f_{\phi}) \leq \sum_{p} c_{p} p$

See the complete version of the proposition and its proof in Appendix A. In the example in Figure 1c, we have  $p \in \{0.5\}$  and  $c_{0.5} = 1$ , thus  $\mathrm{acc}(f_{\phi}) \leq 0.5$ . In contrast, we can choose an unconstrained model from a model class with a universal approximation property and given properly chosen hyperparameters find a model with arbitrarily good accuracy.

# 4.4 OBJECT TRANSFORMATION AND IMAGE TRANSFORMATION

In tasks with visual inputs  $(X = \mathbb{R}^{c\times h\times w})$ , incorrect or extrinsic equivariance will exist when the transformation of the image does not match the transformation of the latent state of the task. In such case, we call  $\rho_{x}$  the object transform and  $\hat{\rho}_{x}$  the image transform. For an image input  $x\in X$ , the image transform  $\hat{\rho}_x(g)x$  is defined as a simple transformation of pixel locations (e.g., Figure 2a-c where  $g = \pi /2\in \mathrm{SO}(2)$ ), while the object transform  $\rho_x(g)x$  is an implicit map transforming the objects in the image (e.g., Figure 2a-b where  $g = \pi /2\in \mathrm{SO}(2)$ ). The dis

tinction between object transform and image transform is often caused by some symmetry-breaking factors such as camera angle, occlusion, backgrounds, and so on (e.g., Figure 2). We refer to such symmetry-breaking factors as symmetry corruptions.

# 5 EVALUATING EQUIVARIANT NETWORK WITH SYMMETRY CORRUPTIONS

Although it is preferable to use an equivariant model to enforce correct equivariance, real-world problems often contain some symmetry corruptions, such as oblique viewing angles, which mean

the symmetry is latent. In this experiment, we evaluate the effect of different corruptions on an equivariant model and show that enforcing extrinsic equivariance can actually improve performance. We experiment with a simple supervised learning task where the scene contains three ducks of different colors. The data samples are pairs of images where all ducks in the first image are rotated by some  $g \in C_8$  to produce the second image within each pair. Given the correct  $g$ , the goal is to train a network  $f_{\phi} : \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 4 \times h \times w} \to \mathbb{R}^{|C_8|}$  to classify the rotation (Figure 3a). If we have a perfect top-down image observation, then the object transform and image transform are equal, and we can enforce the correct equivariance by modeling the ground truth function  $f$  as an invariant network  $f_{\phi}(\rho_x(g)x) = f_{\phi}(x)$  where  $g \in \mathrm{SO}(2)$  (because the rotation of the two images will not change the relative rotation between the objects in the two images). To mimic symmetry corruptions in real-world applications, we apply seven different transformations to both pairs of images shown in Figure 3b (more corruptions are considered in Appendix D.1). In particular, for invert-label, the ground truth label  $g$  is inverted to  $-g$  when the yellow duck is on the left of the orange duck in the world frame in the first input image. Notice that enforcing SO(2)-invariance in  $f_{\phi}$  under invert-label is an incorrect equivariant constraint because a rotation on the ducks might change their relative position in the world frame and break the invariance of the task:  $f(gx) \neq f(x), \exists g \in \mathrm{SO}(2)$ . However, in all other corruptions, enforcing SO(2)-invariance is an extrinsic equivariance because  $gx$  will be out of the input distribution. We evaluate the equivariant network defined in group  $C_8$  implemented using e2cnn (Weiler & Cesa, 2019). See Appendix C.1 for the training details.

Comparing Equivariant Networks with CNNs. We first compare the performance of an equivariant network (Equi) and a conventional CNN model (CNN) with a similar number of trainable parameters. The network architectures are relatively simple (see Appendix B.1) as our goal is to evaluate the performance difference between an equivariant network and an unconstrained CNN model rather than achieving the best performance in this task. In both models, we apply a random crop after sampling each data batch to improve the sample efficiency. See Appendix D.1 for the effects of random crop augmentation on learning. Figure 4 (blue vs green) shows the test accuracy of both models after convergence when trained with varying dataset sizes. For all corruptions with extrinsic equivariance constraints, the equivariant network performs better than the CNN model, especially in low data regimes. However, for invert-label which gives an incorrect equivariance constraint, the CNN outperforms the equivariant model, demonstrating that enforcing incorrect equivariance negatively impacts accuracy. In fact, based on Proposition 4.1, the equivariant network here has a theoretical upper bound performance of  $62.5\%$ . First,  $p \in \{1,0.5\}$ . Then  $p = 1$  when  $f(x) \in \{0,\pi\} \subseteq C_8$  where  $f(x) = -f(x)$  (i.e., negating the label won't change it), and  $c_{1} = 2/8 = 0.25$ . The consensus proportion  $p = 0.5$  when  $f(x) \in \{\pi/4,\pi/2,3\pi/4,5\pi/4,3\pi/2,7\pi/4\} \subseteq C_8$ , where half of the labels in the orbit of  $x$  will be the negation of the labels of the other half (because half of  $g \in C_8$

will change the relative position between the yellow and orange duck), thus  $c_{0.5} = 6 / 8 = 0.75$ .  $\mathrm{acc}(f_{\phi}) \leq 1 \times 0.25 + 0.5 \times 0.75 = 0.625$ . This theoretical upper bound matches the result in Figure 4. Figure 4 suggests that even in the presence of symmetry corruptions, enforcing extrinsic equivariance can improve the sample efficiency compared with an unconstrained model while incorrect equivariance is detrimental.

Extrinsic Image Augmentation Helps in Learning Correct Symmetry. In these experiments, we further illustrate that enforcing extrinsic equivariance helps the model learn the latent equivariance of the task for in-distribution data. As an alternative to equivariant networks, we consider an older alternative for symmetry learning, data augmentation, to see whether extrinsic symmetry augmentations can improve the performance of an unconstrained CNN by helping it learn latent symmetry. Specifically, we augment each training sample with  $C_8$  image rotations while keeping the validation and test set unchanged. As is shown in Figure 4, adding such extrinsic data augmentation (CNN + Img Trans, red) significantly improves the performance of CNN (green), and nearly matches the performance of the equivariant network (blue). Notice that in invert-label, adding such augmentation hurts the performance of CNN because of incorrect equivariance.

# 6 EXTRINSIC EQUIVARIANCE IN REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

The results in Section 5 suggest that enforcing extrinsic equivariance can help the model better learn the latent symmetry in the task. In this section, we apply this methodology in reinforcement learning and demonstrate that extrinsic equivariance can significantly improve sample efficiency.

# 6.1 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING IN ROBOTIC MANIPULATION

We first experiment in five robotic manipulation environments shown in Figure 6. The state space  $S = \mathbb{R}^{4\times h\times w}$  is a 4-channel RGBD image captured from a fixed camera pointed at the workspace (Figure 5). The action space  $A = \mathbb{R}^5$  is the change in gripper pose  $(x,y,z,\theta)$ , where  $\theta$  is the rotation along the  $z$ -axis, and the gripper open width  $\lambda$ . The task has latent O(2) symmetry: when a rotation or reflection is applied to the poses of the gripper and the objects, the action should rotate and reflect accordingly. However, such symmetry does not exist in image space because the image perspective is skewed instead of top-down (we also perform experiments with another symmetry corruption caused by sensor occlusion in

Appendix D.3). We enforce such extrinsic symmetry (group  $D_4$ ) using Equivariant SAC (Wang et al., 2022c;a) equipped with random crop augmentation using RAD (Laskin et al., 2020b) (Equi SAC + RAD) and compare it with the following baselines: 1) CNN SAC + RAD: same as our method but with an unconstrained CNN instead of an equivariant model; 2) CNN SAC + DrQ: same as 1), but with DrQ (Yarats et al., 2021) for the random crop augmentation; 3) FERM (Zhan et al., 2020): a combination of 1) and contrastive learning; and 4) SEN + RAD: Symmetric Embedding Network (Park et al., 2022) that uses a conventional network for the encoder and an equivariant network for the output head. All baselines are implemented such that they have a similar number of parameters as Equivariant SAC. See Appendix B.2 for the network architectures and Appendix E for the architecture hyperparameter search for the baselines. All methods use Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) (Schaul et al., 2015) with pre-loaded expert demonstrations (20 episodes for Block Pulling and Block Pushing, 50 for Block Picking and Painter Opening, and 100 for Block in Bowl). We also add an L2 loss towards the expert action in the actor to encourage expert actions. More details about training are provided in Appendix C.2.

Figure 7 shows that Equivariant SAC (blue) outperforms all baselines. Note that the performance of Equivariant SAC in Figure 7 does not match that reported in Wang et al. (2022c) because we have a harder task setting: we do not have a top-down observation centered at the gripper position as in the prior work. Such top-down observations would not only provide correct equivariance but also help learn a translation-invariant policy. Even in the harder task setting without top-down observations, Figure 7 suggests that Equivariant SAC can still achieve higher performance compared to baselines.

# 6.2 INCREASING CORRUPTION LEVELS

In this experiment, we vary the camera angle by tilting to see how increasing the gap between the image transform and the object transform affects the performance of extrinsically equivariant networks. When the view angle is at 90 degrees (i.e., the image is top-down), the object and image transformation exactly match. As the view angle is decreased, the gap increases. Figure 8 shows the observation at 90 and 15 degree view angles. We remove the robot arm except for the gripper and the blue/white grid on the ground to remove the other symmetry-breaking components in the environment so that the camera angle

is the only symmetry corruption. We compare Equi SAC + RAD against CNN SAC + RAD. We evaluate the performance of each method at the end of training for different view angles in Figure 9. As expected, the performance of Equivariant SAC decreases as the camera angle is decreased, especially from 30 degrees to 15 degrees. On the other hand, CNN generally has similar performance for all view angles, with the exception of Block Pulling and Block Pushing, where decreasing the view angle leads to higher performance. This may be because decreasing the view angle helps the network to better understand the height of the gripper, which is useful for pulling and pushing actions.

# 6.3 EXAMPLE OF INCORRECT EQUIVARIANCE

We demonstrate an example where incorrect equivariance can harm the performance of Equivariant SAC compared to an unconstrained model. We modify the environments so that the image state will be reflected across the vertical axis with  $50\%$  probability and then also reflected across the horizontal axis with  $50\%$  probability (see Figure 10). As these random reflections are contained in  $D_4$ , the transformed state  $\operatorname{reflect}(s), s \in S$  is affected by Equivari-

ant SAC's symmetry constraint. In particular, as the actor produces a transformed action for reflect when the optimal action should actually be invariant, the extrinsic equivariance constraint now becomes an incorrect equivariance for these reflected states. As shown in Figure 11, Equivariant SAC can barely learn under random reflections, while CNN can still learn a useful policy.

Figure 10: The environment conducts a random reflection on the state image at every step. The four images show the four possible reflections, each has  $25\%$  probability.

# 6.4 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING IN DEEPMIND CONTROL SUITE

We further apply extrinsically equivariant networks to continuous control tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) (Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2020). We use a subset of the domains in DMC that have clear object-level symmetry and use the  $D_{1}$  group for cartpole, cup catch, pendulum,acrobot domains, and  $D_{2}$  for reacher domains. This leads to a total of 7 tasks, with 4 easy and 3 medium

![](images/19a7a48c28ac803b7fc292660fc5da0d542b1ab5bacdd33258c6d3f0d8a2830c.jpg)  
Figure 12: Comparison between Equivariant DrQv2 and Non-equivariant DrQv2 on easy tasks (top) and medium tasks (bottom). The evaluation is performed every 10000 environment steps.

level tasks as defined in (Yarats et al., 2022). Note that all of these domains are not fully equivariant as they include a checkered grid for the floor and random stars as the background.

We use DrQv2 Yarats et al. (2022), a SOTA model-free RL algorithm for image-based control, as our base RL algorithm. We create an equivariant version of DrQv2, with an equivariant actor and invariant critic with respect to the environment's symmetry group. We follow closely the architecture and training hyperparameters used in the original paper except in the image encoder, where two max-pooling layers are added to further reduce the representation dimension for faster training. Furthermore, DrQv2 uses convolution layers in the image encoder and then flattens its output to feed it into linear layers in the actor and the critic. In order to preserve this design choice for the equivariant model, we do not reduce the spatial dimensions to  $1 \times 1$  by downsampling/pooling or stride as commonly done in practice. Rather we flatten the image using a process we term action restriction since the symmetry group is restricted from  $\mathbb{Z}^2 \ltimes D_k$  to  $D_k$ . Let  $I \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times w \times c}$  denote the image feature where  $D_k$  acts on both the spatial domain and channels. Then we add a new axis corresponding to  $D_k$  by  $\tilde{I} = (gI)_{g \in D_k} \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times w \times c \times 2k}$ . We then flatten to  $\bar{I} = (gI)_{g \in D_k} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 1 \times hwc \times 2k}$ . The intermediate step  $\tilde{I}$  is necessary to encode both the spatial and channel actions into a single axis which ensures the action restriction is  $D_k$ -equivariant. We now map back down to the original dimension with a  $D_k$ -equivariant  $1 \times 1$  convolution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first equivariant version of DrQv2.

We compare the equivariant vs. the non-equivariant (original) DrQv2 algorithm to evaluate whether extrinsic equivariance can still improve training in the original domains (with symmetry corrections). In figures 12, equivariant DrQv2 consistently learns faster than the non-equivariant version on all tasks, where the performance improvement is largest on the more difficult medium tasks. In pendulum swingup, both methods have 1 failed run each, leading to a large standard error, see Figure 26 in Appendix D.4 for a plot of all runs. These results highlight that even with some symmetry corrections, equivariant policies can outperform non-equivariant ones. See Appendix D.4.1 for an additional experiment where we vary the level of symmetry corrections as in Section 6.2.

# 7 DISCUSSION

This paper defines correct equivariance, incorrect equivariance, and extrinsic equivariance, and identifies that enforcing extrinsic equivariance does not necessarily increase error. This paper further demonstrates experimentally that extrinsic equivariance can provide significant performance improvements in reinforcement learning. A limitation of this work is that we mainly experiment in reinforcement learning and a simple supervised setting but not in other domains where equivariant learning is widely used. The experimental results of our work suggest that an extrinsic equivariance should also be beneficial in those domains, but we leave this demonstration to future work. Another limitation is that we focus on planar equivariant networks. In future work, we are interested in evaluating extrinsic equivariance in network architectures that process different types of data.

# REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

For the review propose, our code is anonymously available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/surprising_equi/. In the final submission, we will include a link to a public-available repository.

# ETHIC STATEMENT

Equivariant models allow us to train robots faster and more accurately in many different tasks. Our work shows this advantage can be applied even more broadly to tasks in real-world conditions. Our method is agnostic to the morality of the actions which robots are trained for and, in that sense, can make it easier for robots to be used for either societally beneficial or detrimental tasks.
