# ABSTRACT

Ensemble learning is a popular technique to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. It hinges on the rationale that aggregating multiple weak models can lead to better models with lower variance and hence higher stability, especially for discontinuous base learners. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on ensembling. By selecting the best model trained on subsamples via majority voting, we can attain exponentially decaying tails for the excess risk, even if the base learner suffers from slow (i.e., polynomial) decay rates. This tail enhancement power of ensembling is agnostic to the underlying base learner and is stronger than variance reduction in the sense of exhibiting rate improvement. We demonstrate how our ensemble methods can substantially improve out-of-sample performances in a range of examples involving heavy-tailed data or intrinsically slow rates.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Ensemble learning (Dietterich, 2000; Zhou, 2012) is a class of methods to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. It comprises repeated training of models (the "base learners"), which are then aggregated through averaging or majority vote. In the literature, the main justification for ensemble methods, such as bootstrap aggregating (bagging) (Breiman, 1996) and boosting (Freund et al., 1996), pertains to bias/variance reduction or higher stability. This justification has been shown to be particularly relevant for certain U-statistics (Buja & Stuetzle, 2006) and models with hard-thresholding rules such as decision trees (Breiman, 2001; Drucker & Cortes, 1995).

Contrary to the established understanding, in this paper we present a new view of ensembling in offering an arguably stronger power than variance reduction: By suitably selecting the best base learners trained on random subsamples, ensembling leads to exponentially decaying excess risk tails. In particular, for general stochastic optimization problems that suffer from a slow, namely polynomial, decay in excess risk tails, ensembling can reduce these tails to an exponential decay rate. Thus, instead of the typical constant factor of improvement exhibited by variance reduction, our ensemble method offers a rate improvement, and moreover, the improvement is substantial.

In the following, we will first qualify our claims above by discussing how slow convergence can arise generically in machine learning and more general data-driven decision-making problems under heavy-tailed data. We then give intuition on our new ensembling perspective, proposed procedures, and the technicality involved in a full analysis.

Main results at a high level. We begin by introducing a generic stochastic optimization problem

$$
\min  _ {\theta \in \Theta} L (\theta) := \mathbb {E} [ l (\theta , z) ], \tag {1}
$$

where  $\theta$  is the decision variable on space  $\Theta$ ,  $z \in \mathcal{Z}$  denotes the randomness governed by a probability distribution, and  $l$  is the cost function.  $n$  i.i.d. samples  $\{z_1, \ldots, z_n\}$  are available from the underlying distribution of  $z$ . In machine learning,  $\theta$  corresponds to model parameters,  $\{z_1, \ldots, z_n\}$  the training data,  $l$  the loss function, and  $L$  the population-level expected loss. More generally, (1) encapsulates data-driven decision-making problems, namely the integration of data on  $z$  into a downstream optimization task with overall cost function  $l$  and prescriptive decision  $\theta$ . These problems are increasingly prevalent in various industrial applications (Kamble et al., 2020; Bertsimas et al., 2023; Ghosal et al., 2024), such as in supply chain network design where  $\theta$  may represent the decision to

open processing facilities,  $z$  the uncertain supply and demand, and  $l$  the total cost of processing and transportation.

Given the data, we can train the model or decision with a learning algorithm that maps the data to an element in  $\Theta$ . This encompasses a wide range of methods, including machine learning training algorithms and data-driven approaches like sample average approximation (SAA) (Shapiro et al., 2021) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) (Mohajerin Esfahani & Kuhn, 2018) in stochastic optimization. Our proposal and theory described below are agnostic to the choice of learning algorithm.

We characterize the generalization performance of a solution to (1), denoted by  $\hat{\theta}$ , via the tail probability bound on the excess risk or regret  $L(\hat{\theta}) - \min_{\theta \in \Theta} L(\theta)$ , i.e.,  $\mathbb{P}(L(\hat{\theta}) > \min_{\theta \in \Theta} L(\theta) + \delta)$  for some fixed  $\delta > 0$ , where the probability is over both the data and training randomness. By a polynomially decaying generalization tail, we mean that

$$
\mathbb {P} \left(L (\hat {\theta}) > \min  _ {\theta \in \Theta} L (\theta) + \delta\right) \leq C _ {1} n ^ {- \alpha} \tag {2}
$$

for some  $\alpha > 0$  and  $C_1$  depends on  $\delta$ . Such bounds are common under heavy-tailed data distributions (Kankova & Houda, 2015; Jiang et al., 2020; Jiang & Li, 2021) due to slow concentration, which frequently arises in machine learning applications such as large language models (e.g., Jalalzai et al. (2020); Zhang et al. (2020); Cutkosky & Mehta (2021) among others), finance (Mainik et al., 2015; Gilli & Kellezi, 2006) and physics (Fortin & Clusel, 2015; Michel & Chave, 2007), and are proved to be tight (Catoni, 2012) for empirical risk minimization (ERM) (Vapnik, 1991). As our key insight, our proposed ensembling methodology can improve the above to an exponential decay, i.e.,

$$
\mathbb {P} \left(L (\hat {\theta}) > \min  _ {\theta \in \Theta} L (\theta) + \delta\right) \leq C _ {2} \gamma^ {n / k}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $k$  is the subsampled data size and can be chosen at a slower rate in  $n$ , and  $\gamma < 1$  depends on  $k, \delta$  such that  $\gamma \rightarrow 0$  as  $k \rightarrow \infty$ . Hence, when  $k$  is properly chosen, the decay becomes exponential. This exponential acceleration is qualitatively different from the well-known variance reduction benefit of assembling in several aspects. First, variance reduction refers to the smaller variability in predictions from models trained on independent data sets, which has a more direct impact on the expected regret than the tail decay rate. Second, the improvement by variance reduction is typical of a constant factor (e.g., Buhlmann & Yu (2002) reported a reduction factor of 3), thus affecting at best the constant  $C_1$  in (2), whereas we obtain an order-of-magnitude improvement.

Main intuition. To facilitate our explanation, let us first focus on discrete space  $\Theta$ . Our ensembling methodology uses a majority-vote mechanism at the model level: After repeatedly running the learning algorithm on subsamples to generate many models, we output the model that occurs most frequently. This implicitly solves a surrogate optimization problem over the same decision space  $\Theta$  as (1) that maximizes the probability of being output by the learning algorithm. This conversion of the original general objective in (1) to a probability objective is the key: As an expectation of a random indicator function, the latter is uniformly bounded even if the original objective is heavy-tailed. Together with a bootstrap argument that establishes the closeness between subsample and full data, this in turn results in exponentially decaying tails for the regret.

For more general problems with continuous space, we replace the simple majority vote with a vote based on the likelihood of being  $\epsilon$ -optimal among all the generated models when evaluated on a random subsample. This avoids the degeneracy issue of using a simple majority vote for continuous problems while retaining similar (in fact, even stronger as we will see) guarantees. Regardless of discrete or continuous model space, our main insight on turning (2) into (3) applies. Moreover, in the discrete case, it turns out that not only the tail bound but also the average-case regret improves exponentially. This also explains why our improvement is particularly significant for discrete-decision problems in the experiments.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our ensemble methods and their finite-sample bounds. Section 3 presents experimental results, and Section 4 discusses related work. Section 5 discusses limitations and concludes the paper. A review of additional related work, technical proofs, and additional experimental results can be found in the appendix.

# 2 METHODOLOGY AND THEORETICAL GUARANTEES

To solve (1) using data, we consider the generic learning algorithm in the form of a mapping

$$
\mathcal {A} \left(z _ {1}, \dots , z _ {n}; \omega\right): \mathcal {Z} ^ {n} \times \Omega \rightarrow \Theta
$$

that takes in the training data  $(z_{1},\ldots ,z_{n})$  and outputs a model possibly under some algorithmic randomness  $\omega$  that is independent of the data. Examples of  $\omega$  include gradient sampling in stochastic first-order algorithms and feature/data subsampling in random forests.  $\mathcal{A}(z_1,\dots,z_n;\omega)$  serves as our base learner. For convenience, we omit  $\omega$  to write  $\mathcal{A}(z_1,\ldots ,z_n)$  when no confusion arises.

# 2.1 A BASIC PROCEDURE

We first introduce a procedure called MoVE that applies to discrete solution or model space  $\Theta$ . MoVE, which is formally described in Algorithm 1, repeatedly draws a total of  $B$  subsamples from the data without replacement, learns a model via  $\mathcal{A}$  on each subsample, and finally conducts a majority vote to output the most frequently subsampled model. Tie-breaking can be done arbitrarily.

# Algorithm 1 Majority Vote Ensembling (MoVE)

1: Input: A base learning algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ ,  $n$  i.i.d. observations  $\mathbf{z}_{1:n} = (z_1, \ldots, z_n)$ , subsample size  $k < n$ , and ensemble size  $B$ .  
2: for  $b = 1$  to  $B$  do  
3: Randomly sample  $\mathbf{z}_k^b = (z_1^b,\dots ,z_k^b)$  uniformly from  $\mathbf{z}_{1:n}$  without replacement, and obtain  $\hat{\theta}_k^b = \mathcal{A}(z_1^b,\ldots ,z_k^b)$ .  
4: end for  
5: Output:  $\hat{\theta}_n \in \arg \max_{\theta \in \Theta} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \mathbb{1}(\theta = \hat{\theta}_k^b)$ .

To understand MoVE, we consider an optimization associated with the base learner  $\mathcal{A}$

$$
\max  _ {\theta \in \Theta} p _ {k} (\theta) := \mathbb {P} \left(\theta = \mathcal {A} \left(z _ {1}, \dots , z _ {k}\right)\right), \tag {4}
$$

which maximizes the probability of a model being output by the base learner on  $k$  i.i.d. observations. Here the probability  $\mathbb{P}$  is with respect to both the training data and the algorithmic randomness. If  $B = \infty$ , MoVE essentially maximizes an empirical approximation of (4), i.e.

$$
\max  _ {\theta \in \Theta} \mathbb {P} _ {*} (\theta = \mathcal {A} \left(z _ {1} ^ {*}, \dots , z _ {k} ^ {*}\right)), \tag {5}
$$

where  $(z_1^*,\ldots ,z_k^*)$  is a uniform random subsample from  $(z_{1},\dots ,z_{n})$ , and  $\mathbb{P}_*$  denotes the probability with respect to the algorithmic randomness and the subsampling randomness conditioned on  $(z_{1},\ldots ,z_{n})$ . With a finite  $B < \infty$ , extra Monte Carlo noises are introduced, leading to the following maximization problem

$$
\max  _ {\theta \in \Theta} \frac {1}{B} \sum_ {b = 1} ^ {B} \mathbb {1} \left(\theta = \mathcal {A} \left(z _ {1} ^ {b}, \dots , z _ {k} ^ {b}\right)\right), \tag {6}
$$

which gives exactly the output of MoVE. In other words, MoVE is a bootstrap approximation to the solution of (4). The following result materializes the intuition explained in the introduction on the conversion of the original potentially heavy-tailed problem (1) into a probability maximization (6) that possesses exponential bounds:

Theorem 1 (Finite-sample bound for Algorithm 1) Consider discrete decision space  $\Theta$ . Recall  $p_k(\theta)$  defined in (4). Let  $p_k^{\max} \coloneqq \max_{\theta \in \Theta} p_k(\theta)$ ,  $\mathcal{E}_{k,\delta} \coloneqq \mathbb{P}(L(\mathcal{A}(z_1, \ldots, z_k)) > \min_{\theta \in \Theta} L(\theta) + \delta)$  be the excess risk tail of  $\mathcal{A}$ , and

$$
\eta_ {k, \delta} := p _ {k} ^ {\max } - \mathcal {E} _ {k, \delta}. \tag {7}
$$

For every  $k \leq n$  and  $\delta \geq 0$  such that  $\eta_{k,\delta} > 0$ , the solution output by MoVE satisfies that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {P} \left(L (\hat {\theta} _ {n}) > \min  _ {\theta \in \Theta} L (\theta) + \delta\right) \\ \leq \left| \Theta \right|\left[ \right. \exp \left( \right.- \frac {n}{2 k} \cdot D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left( \right.p _ {k} ^ {\max } - \frac {3 \eta_ {k , \delta}}{4} \left\| \right. p _ {k} ^ {\max } - \eta_ {k, \delta}\left. \right)\left. \right)\left. \right) + 2 \exp \left( \right.- \frac {n}{2 k} \cdot D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left( \right.p _ {k} ^ {\max } - \frac {\eta_ {k , \delta}}{4} \left\| \right. p _ {k} ^ {\max }\left. \right)\left. \right)\left. \right) \\ + \exp \left(- \frac {B}{2 4} \cdot \frac {\eta_ {k , \delta} ^ {2}}{\operatorname* {m i n} \left(p _ {k} ^ {\operatorname* {m a x}} , 1 - p _ {k} ^ {\operatorname* {m a x}}\right) + 3 \eta_ {k , \delta} / 4}\right) \\ + \mathbb {1} \left(p _ {k} ^ {\max } + \frac {\eta_ {k , \delta}}{4} \leq 1\right) \cdot \exp \left(- \frac {n}{2 k} \cdot D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(p _ {k} ^ {\max } + \frac {\eta_ {k , \delta}}{4} \left\| p _ {k} ^ {\max }\right) - \frac {B}{2 4} \cdot \frac {\eta_ {k , \delta} ^ {2}}{1 - p _ {k} ^ {\max } + \eta_ {k , \delta} / 4}\right) \right]. \tag {8} \\ \end{array}
$$

In particular, if  $\eta_{k,\delta} > 4 / 5$ , (8) is further bounded by

$$
\left. \left| \Theta \right| \left(3 \min  \left(e ^ {- 2 / 5}, C _ {1} \max  \left(1 - p _ {k} ^ {\max }, \mathcal {E} _ {k, \delta}\right)\right) ^ {\frac {n}{C _ {2} k}} + e ^ {- B / C _ {3}}\right), \right. \tag {9}
$$

where  $C_1, C_2, C_3 > 0$  are universal constants,  $|\Theta|$  denotes the cardinality of  $\Theta$ , and  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p\| q) \coloneqq p\ln \frac{p}{q} + (1 - p)\ln \frac{1 - p}{1 - q}$  is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two Bernoulli distributions with means  $p$  and  $q$ .

Theorem 1 states that the excess risk tail of MoVE decays exponentially in the ratio  $n / k$  and ensemble size  $B$ . The bound consists of three parts. The first part has two terms with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and arises from the bootstrap approximation of (4) with (5). The second part quantifies the Monte Carlo error in approximating (5) with a finite  $B$ . The third part comes from the interaction between the two sources of errors and is typically of higher order. The multiplier  $|\Theta|$  in the bound is avoidable, e.g., via a space reduction as in our next algorithm.

The quantity  $\eta_{k,\delta}$  plays two roles. First, it quantifies how suboptimality in the surrogate problem (4) propagates to the original problem (1) in that every  $\eta_{k,\delta}$ -optimal solution for (4) is  $\delta$ -optimal for (1). Second,  $\eta_{k,\delta}$  is directly related to the excess risk tail  $\mathcal{E}_{k,\delta}$  of the base learner, in addition to  $p_k^{\mathrm{max}}$  that captures the concentration of the base learner on  $\delta$ -optimal solutions. Therefore,  $\eta_{k,\delta}$  taking large values signals the situation where the base learner already generalizes well. In this case, (8) can be simplified to (9). The bound (9) suggests that our approach does not hurt the performance of an already high-performing base learner as its generalization power is inherited through the  $\max(1 - p_k^{\mathrm{max}}, \mathcal{E}_{k,\delta})$  term in the bound. See Appendix B for a more detailed comparison.

The quantity  $\eta_{k,\delta}$  also hints at how to choose the subsample size  $k$ . As long as  $\eta_{k,\delta}$  is bounded away from 0, our bound decays exponentially fast. Therefore,  $k$  can be chosen in such a way that the base learner outputs good models more often than bad ones in order for the exponential decay of our bound to take effect, but at the same time considerably smaller than  $n$  to ensure the amount of acceleration. In the experiments, we choose  $k = \max(10, n/200)$ .

On the choice of  $B$ , note that the two KL divergences in the first part of the tail bound (8) are in general bounded below by  $\mathcal{O}(\eta_{k,\delta}^2)$  and so is the  $\eta_{k,\delta}^2 / (\min(p_k^{\max}, 1 - p_k^{\max}) + 3\eta_{k,\delta}/4)$  in the second part as  $\eta_{k,\delta}$  is no larger than 1. Therefore using an ensemble size of  $B = \mathcal{O}(n/k)$  is sufficient to control the Monte Carlo error to a similar magnitude as the data error.

# 2.2 A MORE GENERAL PROCEDURE

We next present a more general procedure called ROVE that applies to continuous space where simple majority vote in Algorithm 1 can lead to degeneracy, i.e., all learned models appear exactly once in the pool. Moreover, this general procedure relaxes our dependence on  $|\Theta|$  in the bound in Theorem 1.

ROVE, displayed in Algorithm 2, proceeds initially the same as MoVE in repeatedly subsampling data and training the model using  $\mathcal{A}$ . However, in the aggregation step, instead of using a simple majority vote, ROVE outputs, among all the trained models, the one that has the highest likelihood of being  $\epsilon$ -optimal. This  $\epsilon$ -optimality avoids the degeneracy of the majority vote and, moreover, since we have restricted our output to the collection of trained models, the corresponding likelihood

Algorithm 2 Retrieval and  $\epsilon$ -Optimality Vote Ensembling (ROVE / ROVEs)

Input: A base learning algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ ,  $n$  i.i.d. observations  $\mathbf{z}_{1:n} = (z_1, \ldots, z_n)$ , subsample size  $k_1, k_2 < n$  (if no split) or  $n/2$  (if split), ensemble sizes  $B_1$  and  $B_2$ .

# Phase I: Model Candidate Retrieval

for  $b = 1$  to  $B_{1}$  do

Randomly sample  $\mathbf{z}_{k_1}^b = (z_1^b, \ldots, z_{k_1}^b)$  uniformly from  $\mathbf{z}_{1:n}$  (if no split) or  $\mathbf{z}_{1:\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}$  (if split) without replacement, and obtain  $\hat{\theta}_{k_1}^b = A(z_1^b, \ldots, z_{k_1}^b)$ .

end for

Let  $\mathcal{S} \coloneqq \{\hat{\theta}_{k_1}^b : b = 1, \dots, B_1\}$  be the set of all retrieved models.

# Phase II:  $\epsilon$ -Optimality Vote

Choose  $\epsilon \geq 0$  using the data  $\mathbf{z}_{1:n}$  (if no split) or  $\mathbf{z}_{1:\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}$  (if split).

for  $b = 1$  to  $B_{2}$  do

Randomly sample  $\mathbf{z}_{k_2}^b = (z_1^b,\dots ,z_{k_2}^b)$  uniformly from  $\mathbf{z}_{1:n}$  (if no split) or  $\mathbf{z}_{\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor +1:n}$  (if split) without replacement, and calculate

$$
\widehat {\Theta} _ {k _ {2}} ^ {\epsilon , b} := \left\{\theta \in \mathcal {S}: \frac {1}{k _ {2}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {k _ {2}} l \left(\theta , z _ {i} ^ {b}\right) \leq \min  _ {\theta^ {\prime} \in \mathcal {S}} \frac {1}{k _ {2}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {k _ {2}} l \left(\theta^ {\prime}, z _ {i} ^ {b}\right) + \epsilon \right\}.
$$

end for

Output:  $\hat{\theta}_n\in \arg \max_{\theta \in S}\sum_{b = 1}^{B_2}\mathbb{1}(\theta \in \widehat{\Theta}_{k_2}^{\epsilon ,b})$

maximization is readily doable by simple enumeration. In addition, it helps reduce competition for votes among the best models as each subsample can now vote for multiple candidates, ensuring a high vote count for each of the top models even when there are many of them. This makes ROVE more effective than MoVE in the case of multiple (near) optima as our experiments will show. We have the following theoretical guarantees for Algorithm 2:

Theorem 2 (Finite-sample bound for Algorithm 2) Recall the tail  $\mathcal{E}_{k,\delta}$  of the base excess risk from Theorem 1. Consider Algorithm 2 with data splitting, i.e., ROVEs. Let  $T_{k}(\cdot) := \mathbb{P}(\sup_{\theta \in \Theta} |(1/k) \sum_{i=1}^{k} l(\theta, z_{i}) - L(\theta)| > \cdot)$  be the tail function of the maximum deviation of the empirical objective estimate. For every  $\delta > 0$ , if  $\epsilon$  is chosen such that  $\mathbb{P}(\epsilon \in [\underline{\epsilon}, \overline{\epsilon}]) = 1$  for some  $0 < \underline{\epsilon} \leq \overline{\epsilon} < \delta$  and  $T_{k_{2}}((\delta - \overline{\epsilon})/2) + T_{k_{2}}(\underline{\epsilon}/2) < 1/5$ , then

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {P} \left(L (\hat {\theta} _ {n}) > \min  _ {\theta \in \Theta} L (\theta) + 2 \delta\right) \leq B _ {1} \left[ 3 \min  \left(e ^ {- 2 / 5}, C _ {1} T _ {k _ {2}} \left(\frac {\min  (\underline {{\epsilon}}, \delta - \bar {\epsilon})}{2}\right)\right) ^ {\frac {n}{2 C _ {2} k _ {2}}} + e ^ {- B _ {2} / C _ {3}} \right] \tag {10} \\ + \min \left(e ^ {- (1 - \mathcal {E} _ {k _ {1}, \delta}) / C _ {4}}, C _ {5} \mathcal {E} _ {k _ {1}, \delta}\right) ^ {\frac {n}{2 C _ {6} k _ {1}}} + e ^ {- B _ {1} (1 - \mathcal {E} _ {k _ {1}, \delta}) / C _ {7}}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $C_1, C_2, C_3$  are the same as those in Theorem 1, and  $C_4, C_5, C_6, C_7$  are universal constants.

Consider Algorithm 2 without data splitting, i.e., ROVE, and discrete space  $\Theta$ . Assume  $\lim_{k\to \infty}T_k(\delta) = 0$  for all  $\delta >0$ . Then, for every fixed  $\delta >0$ , we have  $\lim_{n\to \infty}\mathbb{P}(L(\hat{\theta}_n)>\min_{\theta \in \Theta}L(\theta) + 2\delta)\rightarrow 0$ , if  $\lim \sup_{k\to \infty}\mathcal{E}_{k,\delta} < 1$ ,  $\mathbb{P}(\epsilon >\delta /2)\rightarrow 0$ ,  $k_{1}$  and  $k_{2}\rightarrow \infty$ ,  $n / k_{1}$  and  $n / k_{2}\rightarrow \infty$ , and  $B_{1},B_{2}\rightarrow \infty$  as  $n\rightarrow \infty$ .

Theorem 2 provides an exponential excess risk tail, regardless of discrete or continuous space. The first line in the bound (10) is inherited from the bound (9) for MoVE from majority to  $\epsilon$ -optimality vote. In particular, the multiplier  $|\Theta|$  in (9) is now replaced by  $B_{1}$ , the number of retrieved models. The second line in (10) bounds the performance sacrifice due to the restriction to Phase I model candidates.

ROVE may be carried out with the data split between the two phases, in which case it's referred to as ROVEs. Data splitting makes the procedure theoretically more tractable by avoiding inter-dependency between the phases but sacrifices some statistical power from halving the data size. Empirically we find ROVE to be overall more effective.

The optimality threshold  $\epsilon$  is allowed to be chosen in a data-driven way and the main goal guiding this choice is to be able to distinguish models of different qualities. In other words,  $\epsilon$  should be chosen to

create enough variability in the likelihood of being  $\epsilon$ -optimal across models. In our experiments, we find it a good strategy to choose an  $\epsilon$  that leads to a maximum likelihood around  $1/2$ .

Lastly, our main theoretical results, Theorems 1 and 2, are derived using several novel techniques. First, we develop a sharper concentration result for U-statistics with binary kernels, improving upon standard Bernstein-type inequalities (e.g., Arcones (1995); Peel et al. (2010)). This refinement ensures the correct order of the bound, particularly (9), which captures the convergence of both the bootstrap approximation and the base learner, offering insights into the robustness of our methods for fast-converging base learners. Second, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the regret for the original problem (1) relative to the surrogate optimization (4), translating the superior generalization in the surrogate problem into accelerated convergence for the original. Finally, to establish asymptotic consistency for Algorithm 2 without data splitting, we develop a uniform law of large numbers (LLN) for the class of events of being  $\epsilon$ -optimal, using direct analysis of the second moment of the maximum deviation. Uniform LLNs are particularly challenging here because, unlike fixed classes in standard settings, this class dynamically depends on subsample size  $k_{2}$  as  $n \to \infty$ .

# 3 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we numerically test Algorithm 1 (MoVE), Algorithm 2 with (ROVEs) and without (ROVE) data splitting in training neural networks for regression problems and solving stochastic programs. Additional experimental results are provided in Appendix D due to space constraints. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/vote_ensemble.

To empirically determine well-performing configurations for general use, we performed a comprehensive hyperparameter profiling of our algorithms in Appendix D.3. Below, we summarize the recommended configurations used in all experiments presented in this section (except Figure 4): 1) For discrete space  $\Theta$ , use  $k = \max(10, n/200)$ ,  $B = 200$  for MoVE, and  $k_1 = k_2 = \max(10, n/200)$ ,  $B_1 = 20$ ,  $B_2 = 200$  for ROVE and ROVEs; 2) For continuous space  $\Theta$ , use  $k_1 = \max(30, n/2)$ ,  $k_2 = \max(30, n/200)$ ,  $B_1 = 50$ ,  $B_2 = 200$  for ROVE and ROVEs; 3) The  $\epsilon$  in ROVE and ROVEs is selected such that  $\max_{\theta \in S}(1/B_2) \sum_{b=1}^{B_2} \mathbb{1}(\theta \in \widehat{\Theta}_{k_2}^{\epsilon,b}) \approx 1/2$ .

# 3.1 NEURAL NETWORKS FOR REGRESSION

We consider regression problems with multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) on both synthetic and real data. The base learning algorithm splits the data into training  $(70\%)$  and validation  $(30\%)$ , and uses Adam to minimize mean squared error (MSE), with early stopping triggered when the validation improvement falls below  $3\%$  between epochs. The architecture details of the MLPs are provided in Appendix D.1. Note that MoVE is not included in this comparison as it's applicable to discrete problems only.

Setup for Synthetic Data Input-output pairs  $(X,Y)$  are generated as  $Y = (1 / 50)\cdot \sum_{j = 1}^{50}\log (X_j + 1) + \varepsilon$ , where each  $X_{j}$  is drawn independently from  $\mathrm{Unif}(0,2 + 198(j - 1) / 49)$ , and the noise  $\varepsilon$  is independent of  $X$  with zero mean. We consider both standard Gaussian noise and Pareto noise  $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_1 - \varepsilon_2$ , where each  $\varepsilon_{i}\sim \mathrm{Pareto}(2.1)$ . The out-of-sample performance is estimated on a common test set of one million samples. Each algorithm is repeatedly applied to 200 independently generated datasets to assess the average and tail performance.

Setup for Real Data We use six datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Blake, 1998): Wine Quality (Cortez et al., 2009), Bike Sharing (Fanaee-T, 2013), Online News (Fernandes et al., 2015), Appliances Energy (Candanedo, 2017), Superconductivity (Hamidieh, 2018), and Gas Turbine Emission (gas, 2019). Each dataset is standardized (zero mean, unit variance). To evaluate the average and tail performance, we permute each dataset 100 times, and each time use the first half for training and the second for testing.

Result. As shown in Figure 1, in heavy-tailed noise settings (Figures 1a–1c), both ROVE and ROVEs significantly outperform the base algorithm in terms of both expected out-of-sample MSE and tail performance under all sample sizes  $n$ . Notably, the performance improvement becomes more

pronounced with deeper networks ( $H = 8$ ), indicating that the benefits of ROVE and ROVEs are more apparent in models with higher expressiveness and lower bias.

In light-tailed settings (Figures 1d-1f), ROVE and ROVEs show comparable expected out-of-sample performance to the base when  $H = 4$ , but outperform the base as  $H$  increases. Additionally, ROVE and ROVEs outperform the base in tail probabilities even when  $H = 4$ . This indicates that ROVE and ROVEs provide better generalization as the model complexity grows even for light-tailed problems. Similar results for MLPs with 2 and 6 hidden layers can be found in Appendix D.4, where results on least squares regression and Ridge regression are also provided.

On real datasets (Figure 2), ROVE exhibits much lighter tails compared to the base on three out of six datasets, and similar tail behavior on the other three. ROVEs, however, underperforms the base in these real-world scenarios, potentially due to the data split that compromises its statistical power.

# 3.2 STOCHASTIC PROGRAMS

Setup. We consider four discrete stochastic programs: resource allocation, supply chain network design, maximum weight matching, and stochastic linear programming, alongside one continuous mean-variance portfolio optimization. All problems are designed to possess heavy-tailed uncertainties. For the stochastic linear program, instances with varying tail heaviness are explored to study its impact on algorithm performance. The base learning algorithm for all the problems is the SAA. Detailed descriptions of the problems are deferred to Appendix D.2 and results using DRO as the base algorithm are provided in Appendix D.4.

Result. Figure 3 shows that our ensembling methods generally outperform the base algorithm in all cases, except for the linear program case (Figure 3e). Notably, ROVE still outperforms the base in the linear program case, demonstrating its robustness, while MoVE performs slightly worse than the base under small sample sizes. Comparing ROVE and ROVEs, ROVE consistently exhibits superior performance than ROVEs in all cases.

When there is a unique optimal solution, MoVE and ROVE perform similarly, both generally better than ROVEs, as seen in Figures 3a-3d. However, in cases with multiple optima (Figures 3e and 4a), the performance of MoVE deteriorates while ROVE and ROVEs stay strong. This is in accordance with our discussion on the advantage of  $\epsilon$ -optimality vote in Section 2.2. Additional results in Appendix D.4 shall further explain that optima multiplicity weakens the base learner for MoVE in the sense of decreasing the  $\eta_{k,\delta}$  and hence inflating the tail bound in Theorem 1.

As shown in Figure 4a, the performance gap between ROVE, ROVEs, and the base algorithm becomes increasingly significant as the tail of the uncertainty becomes heavier. This supports the effectiveness of ROVE and ROVEs in handling heavy-tailed uncertainty, where the base algorithm's performance suffers. Note that here MoVE behaves similarly as the base due to optima multiplicity.

The running time comparison in Figure 4b shows that, despite requiring multiple runs on subsamples, our ensembling methods do not introduce a significantly higher computational burden compared to

running the base algorithm on the full sample, and can even be advantageous under large sample sizes. This is because, in problems like DRO (Ben-Tal et al., 2013; Mohajerin Esfahani & Kuhn, 2018) and two-stage stochastic programming, solving the optimization on the full sample often leads to a substantial increase in problem size, as the decision space and constraints grow at least linearly with the sample size. Subsampled optimizations, as performed in our approach, result in smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved more efficiently. Moreover, our theory indicates that solving more than  $\mathcal{O}(n / k)$  subsamples does not further improve generalization performance, ensuring that computational efficiency is maintained. Additionally, parallel processing of subsamples further reduces computational time.

Finally, among the three proposed ensemble methods, ROVE is the preferred choice over MoVE and ROVEs for general use as it's applicable to both discrete and continuous problems and consistently delivers superior and stable performance across all scenarios.

# 4 RELATED WORK

This work is closely connected to various topics in optimization and machine learning, and we only review the most relevant ones. See Appendix A for additional literature review.

Ensemble learning. Ensemble learning (Dietterich, 2000; Zhou, 2012; Sagi & Rokach, 2018) has been widely studied for improving model performance by combining multiple weak learners into strong ones. Popular ensemble methods include bagging (Breiman, 1996), boosting (Freund et al., 1996) and stacking (Wolpert, 1992; Džeroski & Ženko, 2004). Bagging enhances model stability by training models on different bootstrap samples and combining their predictions through majority voting or averaging, effectively reducing variance, especially for unstable learners like decision trees that underpin random forests (Breiman, 2001). Subbagging (Buhlmann & Yu, 2002) is a variant of bagging that constructs the ensemble from subsamples in place of bootstrap samples. Boosting is a sequential process where each subsequent model corrects its predecessors' errors, reducing both bias and variance (Ibragimov & Gusev, 2019; Ghosal & Hooker, 2020). Prominent boosting methods include AdaBoost (Freund et al., 2003), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) (Friedman, 2001; 2002), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) (Friedman et al., 2000) which differ in their approaches to weighting training data and hypotheses. Boosting is commonly used with decision trees as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), including XGBoost (Chen & Guestrin, 2016), LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017), and CatBoost (Hancock & Khoshgoftaar, 2020). Instead of using simple aggregation like weighted averaging or majority voting, stacking trains a model to combine base predictions in a more sophisticated way, further improving performance. A key procedural difference of our approach from these ensemble methods is that we perform majority voting at the model level, rather than at the prediction level, to select a single best model from the ensemble. As a result, our method consistently

outputs models within the same space as the base learner, making it applicable to general stochastic optimization problems. In contrast, most existing ensemble methods yield aggregated models outside the base space. Additionally, compared to the bias/variance reduction of typical ensembles, our approach guarantees exponentially decaying excess risk tails and hence is particularly effective in settings with heavy-tailed noise.

Optimization and learning with heavy tails. Optimization with heavy-tailed noises has garnered significant attention due to its relevance in traditional fields such as portfolio management (Mainik et al., 2015) and scheduling (Im et al., 2015), as well as emerging domains like large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023). Tail bounds of most existing algorithms are guaranteed to decay exponentially under sub-Gaussian or uniformly bounded costs but deteriorate to a slow polynomial decay under heavy-tailedness (Kanikova & Houda, 2015; Jiang et al., 2020; Jiang & Li, 2021; Oliveira & Thompson, 2023). For SAA or ERM, faster rates are possible under the small-ball (Mendelson, 2018; 2015; Roy et al., 2021) or Bernstein's condition (Dinh et al., 2016) on the function class, while our approach is free from such conditions. Considerable effort has been made to mitigate the adverse effects of heavy-tailedness with robust procedures among which the geometric median (Minsker, 2015), or more generally, median-of-means (MOM) (Lugosi & Mendelson, 2019a;c) approach is most similar to ours. The basic idea there is to estimate a true mean by dividing the data into disjoint subsamples, computing an estimate on each, and then taking the median. Lecué & Lerasle (2019); Lugosi & Mendelson (2019b); Lecué & Lerasle (2020) use MOM in estimating the expected cost and establish exponential tail bounds for the mean squared loss and convex function classes. Hsu & Sabato (2016; 2014) apply MOM directly on the solution level for continuous problems and require strong convexity from the cost to establish generalization bounds. Besides MOM, another approach estimates the expected cost via truncation (Catoni, 2012) and allows heavy tails for linear regression (Audibert & Catoni, 2011; Zhang & Zhou, 2018) or problems with uniformly bounded function classes (Brownlees et al., 2015), but is computationally intractable due to the truncation and thus more of theoretical interest. In contrast, our ensemble approach is a meta algorithm that acts on any learning algorithm to provide exponential tail bounds regardless of the underlying problem characteristics. Relatedly, various techniques such as gradient clipping (Cutkosky & Mehta, 2021; Gorbunov et al., 2020) and MOM (Puchkin et al., 2024) have been adopted in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for handling heavy-tailed gradient noises, but their focus is the faster convergence of SGD rather than generalization.

Machine learning for optimization. Learning to optimize (L2O) studies the use of machine learning in accelerating existing or discovering novel optimization algorithms. Much effort has been in training models via supervised or reinforcement learning to make critical algorithmic decisions such as cut selection (e.g., Deza & Khalil (2023); Tang et al. (2020)), search strategies (e.g., Khalil et al. (2016); He et al. (2014); Scavuzzo et al. (2022)), scaling (Berthold & Hendel, 2021), and primal heuristics (Shen et al., 2021) in mixed-integer optimization, or even directly generate high-quality solutions (e.g., neural combinatorial optimization pioneered by Bello et al. (2016)). See Chen et al. (2022; 2024); Bengio et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2023) for comprehensive surveys on L2O. This line of research is orthogonal to our goal, and L2O techniques can work as part of or directly serve as the base learning algorithm within our framework.

# 5 CONCLUSION AND LIMITATION

This paper introduces a novel ensemble technique that significantly improves generalization by aggregating base learners via majority voting. In particular, our approach converts polynomially decaying generalization tails into exponential decay, thus providing order-of-magnitude improvements as opposed to constant factor improvements exhibited by variance reduction. Extensive numerical experiments in both machine learning and stochastic programming validate its effectiveness, especially for scenarios with heavy-tailed data and slow convergence rates. This work underscores the powerful potential of our new ensemble approach across a broad range of machine learning applications.

While our method accelerates tail convergence, it may increase model bias, similar to other subsampling-based techniques like subbagging (Buhlmann & Yu, 2002). This makes it best suited for applications with relatively low bias, e.g., when the model is sufficiently expressive.
