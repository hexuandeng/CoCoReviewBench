# ABSTRACT

In this paper, we propose a new neural architecture search (NAS) problem of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold networks. Unlike the conventional NAS problem, our problem requires to search for a unique computational cell called the SPD cell. This SPD cell serves as a basic building block of SPD neural architectures. An efficient solution to our problem is important to minimize the extraneous manual effort in the SPD neural architecture design. To accomplish this goal, we first introduce a geometrically rich and diverse SPD neural architecture search space for an efficient SPD cell design. Further, we model our new NAS problem using the supernet strategy which models the architecture search problem as a one-shot training process of a single supernet. Based on the supernet modeling, we exploit a differentiable NAS algorithm on our relaxed continuous search space for SPD neural architecture search. Statistical evaluation of our method on drone, action, and emotion recognition tasks mostly provides better results than the state-of-the-art SPD networks and NAS algorithms. Empirical results show that our algorithm excels in discovering better SPD network design, and providing models that are more than 3 times lighter than searched by state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Designing a favorable neural network architecture for a given application requires a lot of time, effort, and domain expertise. To mitigate this issue, researchers in the recent years have started developing algorithms to automate the design process of neural network architectures (Zoph & Le, 2016; Zoph et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017; 2018a; Real et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018b). Although these neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms have shown great potential to provide an optimal architecture for a given application, it is limited to handle architectures with Euclidean operations and representation. To deal with non-euclidean data representation and corresponding set of operations, researchers have barely proposed any NAS algorithms—to the best of our knowledge.

It is well-known that manifold-valued data representation such as symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices have shown overwhelming accomplishments in many real-world applications such as pedestrian detection (Tuzel et al., 2006; 2008), magnetic resonance imaging analysis (Pennec et al., 2006), action recognition (Harandi et al., 2014), face recognition (Huang et al., 2014; 2015), brain-computer interfaces (Barachant et al., 2011), structure from motion (Kumar et al., 2018; Kumar, 2019), etc. Consequently, this has led to the development of SPD neural network (SPDNet) architectures for further improvements in these area of research (Huang & Van Gool, 2017; Brooks et al., 2019). However, these architectures are handcrafted, so, the operations or the parameters defined for these networks generally changes as per the application. This motivated us to propose a new NAS problem of SPD manifold networks. A solution to this problem can reduce the unwanted efforts in SPDNet design. Compared to the traditional NAS problem, our NAS problem requires a new definition of computation cell and proposal for diverse set of SPD candidate operation. In particular, we model the basic architecture cell with a specific directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each node is a latent SPD representation and each edge corresponds to a SPD candidate operation. Here, the intermediate transformations between nodes respects the geometry of the SPD manifolds.

For solving the suggested NAS problem, we exploit a supernet search strategy which models the architecture search problem as a one-shot training process of a supernet that comprises of a mixture of SPD neural architectures. The supernet modeling enables us to perform a differential architecture

search on a continuous relaxation of SPD neural architecture search space, and therefore, can be solved using a gradient descent approach. Our evaluation validates that the proposed method can build a reliable SPD network from scratch. We show the results of our method on benchmark datasets that clearly show results better than handcrafted SPDNet. Our work makes the following contributions:

- We introduce a NAS problem of SPD manifold networks that opens up a new direction of research in automated machine learning and SPD manifold learning. Based on a supernet modeling, we propose a differentiable NAS algorithm for SPD neural architecture search. Concretely, we exploit Fréchet mixture of SPD operations with sparsemax constraint to introduce sparsity, and bi-level optimization with SPD manifold update for joint architecture search and network training.  
- Besides well-studied operations from exiting SPDNets (Huang & Van Gool, 2017; Brooks et al., 2019; Chakraborty et al., 2020), we follow Liu et al. (2018b) to further introduce some new SPD layers, i.e., skip connection, none operation, max pooling and averaging pooling. Our additional set of SPD operations make the search space more diverse for the search algorithm to obtain more generalized SPD neural network architecture.  
- Evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that our searched SPD neural architectures can clearly outperform the existing handcrafted SPDNets (Huang & Van Gool, 2017; Brooks et al., 2019; Chakraborty et al., 2020) and the state-of-the-art NAS methods (Liu et al., 2018b; Chu et al., 2020). Notably, our searched architecture is more than 3 times lighter than searched by the NAS algorithms.

# 2 BACKGROUND

In recent years, plenty of research work has been published in the area of NAS. This is probably due to the success of deep learning for several applications which has eventually led to the automation of neural architecture design. Also, improvements in the processing capabilities of machines has influenced the researchers to work out this computationally expensive yet an important problem. Computational cost for some of the well-known NAS algorithms is in thousands of GPU days which has resulted in the development of several computationally efficient methods (Zoph et al., 2018; Real et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018a; 2017; Baker et al., 2017; Brock et al., 2017; Bender, 2019; Elsken et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2018; Negrinho & Gordon, 2017; Kandasamy et al., 2018; Chu et al., 2020). In this work, we propose a new NAS problem of SPD networks. We solve this problem using a supernet modeling methodology with a one-shot differentiable training process of an overparameterized supernet. Our modeling is driven by the recent progress in supernet methodology. Supernet methodology has shown a great potential than other NAS methodologies in terms of search efficiency. Since our work is directed towards solving a new NAS problem, we confine our discussion to the work that have greatly influenced our method i.e., one-shot NAS methods and SPD networks.

To the best of our knowledge, there are mainly two types of one-shot NAS methods based on the architecture modeling (Elsken et al., 2018) (a) parameterized architecture (Liu et al., 2018b; Zheng et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; Chu et al., 2020), and (b) sampled architecture (Deb et al., 2002; Chu et al., 2019). In this paper, we adhere to the parametric modeling due to its promising results on conventional neural architectures. A majority of the previous work on NAS with continuous search space fine-tunes the explicit feature of specific architectures (Saxena & Verbeek, 2016; Veniat & Denoyer, 2018; Ahmed & Torresani, 2017; Shin et al., 2018). On the contrary, Liu et al. (2018b); Liang et al. (2019); Zhou et al. (2019); Zhang et al. (2020); Wu et al. (2020); Chu et al. (2020) provides architectural diversity for NAS with highly competitive performances. The other part of our work focuses on SPD network architectures. There exist algorithms to develop handcrafted SPDNet (Huang & Van Gool, 2017; Brooks et al., 2019; Chakraborty et al., 2020). To automate the process of SPD network design, in this work, we take the best of both these fields (NAS, SPDNets) and propose a SPD network NAS algorithm. Next, we provide a short summary on the essential notions of Riemannian geometry of SPD manifolds, followed by an introduction of some basic SPDNet operations and layers. As some of the introduced operations and layers have been well-studied by the existing literature, we applied them directly to define our search space of SPD neural architectures.

Representation and Operation: We denote  $n \times n$  real SPD as  $X \in S_{++}^{n}$ . A real SPD matrix  $X \in S_{++}^{n}$  satisfies the property that for any non-zero  $z \in \mathbb{R}^n$ ,  $z^T Xz > 0$ . We denote  $\mathcal{T}_X\mathcal{M}$  as the tangent space of the manifold  $\mathcal{M}$  at  $X \in S_{++}^{n}$ . Let  $X_1, X_2$  be any two points on the SPD manifold then the distance between them is given by

$$
\delta_ {\mathcal {M}} \left(\boldsymbol {X} _ {1}, \boldsymbol {X} _ {2}\right) = 0. 5 \| \log \left(\boldsymbol {X} _ {1} ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \boldsymbol {X} _ {2} \boldsymbol {X} _ {1} ^ {- \frac {1}{2}}\right) \| _ {F} \tag {1}
$$

There are other efficient methods to compute distance between two points on the SPD manifold, however, their discussion is beyond the scope of our work. Other property of the Riemannian manifold of our interest is local diffeomorphism of geodesics which is a one-to-one mapping from the point on the tangent space of the manifold (Lackenby, 2020). To define such notions, let  $\mathbf{X} \in S_{++}^{n}$  be the reference point and,  $\mathbf{Y} \in \mathcal{T}_{\mathbf{X}}S_{++}^{n}$ , then Eq:(2) associates  $\mathbf{Y} \in \mathcal{T}_{\mathbf{X}}S_{++}^{n}$  to a point on the manifold.

$$
\exp_ {\boldsymbol {X}} (\boldsymbol {Y}) = \boldsymbol {X} ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \exp \left(\boldsymbol {X} ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \boldsymbol {Y} \boldsymbol {X} ^ {- \frac {1}{2}}\right) \boldsymbol {X} ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \in S _ {+ +} ^ {n}, \forall \boldsymbol {Y} \in \mathcal {T} _ {\boldsymbol {X}} \tag {2}
$$

Similarly, an inverse map is defined as  $\log_{\pmb{X}}(\pmb{Z}) = \pmb{X}^{\frac{1}{2}}\log (\pmb{X}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\pmb {Z}\pmb{X}^{-\frac{1}{2}})\pmb{X}^{\frac{1}{2}}\in \mathcal{T}_{\pmb{X}},\forall \pmb {Z}\in S_{++}^{n}$

1) Basic operations of SPD Network: It is well-known that operations such as mean centralization, normalization, and adding bias to a batch of data are inherent performance booster for most neural networks. In the same spirit, existing works like Brooks et al. (2019); Chakraborty (2020) use the notion of these operations for the SPD or general manifold data to define analogous operations on manifolds. Below we introduce them following the work of Brooks et al. (2019).

- Batch mean, centering and bias: Given a batch of  $N$  SPD matrices  $\{\mathbf{X}_i\}_{i=1}^N$ , we can compute its Riemannian barycenter  $(\mathcal{B})$  as  $\mathcal{B} = \operatorname*{argmin}_{\mathbf{X}_\mu \in S_{++}^n} \sum_{i=1}^N \delta_{\mathcal{M}}^2(\mathbf{X}_i, \mathbf{X}_\mu)$ . It is sometime referred as Fréchet mean (Moakher, 2005; Bhatia & Holbrook, 2006). This definition is trivially extended to compute the weighted Riemannian Barycenter also known as weighted Fréchet Mean (wFM).

$$
\mathcal {B} = \underset {\boldsymbol {X} _ {\mu} \in \mathcal {S} _ {+ +} ^ {n}} {\operatorname {a r g m i n}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} w _ {i} \delta_ {\mathcal {M}} ^ {2} \left(\boldsymbol {X} _ {i}, \boldsymbol {X} _ {\mu}\right); \text {s . t .} w _ {i} \geq 0 \text {a n d} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} w _ {i} = 1 \tag {3}
$$

Eq:(3) can be approximated using Karcher flow (Karcher, 1977; Bonnabel, 2013; Brooks et al., 2019) or recursive geodesic mean (Cheng et al., 2016; Chakraborty et al., 2020).

2) Basic layers of SPD Network: Analogous to standard CNN, methods like Huang & Van Gool (2017); Brooks et al. (2019); Chakraborty et al. (2020) designed SPD layers to perform operations that respect SPD manifold constraints. Assuming  $\mathbf{X}_{k-1} \in S_{++}^{n}$  be the input SPD matrix to the  $k^{th}$  layer, the SPD network layers are defined as follows:

- BiMap layer: This layer corresponds to a dense layer for SPD data. The BiMap layer reduces the dimension of a input SPD matrix via a transformation matrix  $\mathbf{W}_k$  as  $\mathbf{X}_k = \mathbf{W}_k\mathbf{X}_{k - 1}\mathbf{W}_k^T$ . To ensure the matrix  $\mathbf{X}_k$  to be a valid SPD matrix, the  $\mathbf{W}_k$  matrix must be of full row-rank.  
- Batch normalization layer: To perform batch normalization after each BiMap layer, we first compute the Riemannian barycenter of the batch of SPD matrices followed by a running mean update step, which is Riemannian weighted average between the batch mean and the current running mean, with the weights  $(1 - \theta)$  and  $(\theta)$  respectively. Once mean is calculated, we centralize and add bias to each SPD sample of the batch using Eq.(4) (Brooks et al., 2019):

Batch centering : Centering the  $\mathcal{B}:\pmb{X}_i^c = \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{B}\to I}(\pmb {X}_i) = \mathcal{B}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\pmb {X}_i\mathcal{B}^{-\frac{1}{2}},I$  is the identity matrix (4)

Bias the batch: Bias towards  $G: X_i^b = \mathcal{P}_{I \to G}(X_i^c) = G^{\frac{1}{2}}X_i^cG^{\frac{1}{2}}$ ,  $I$  is the identity matrix

- ReEig layer: The ReEig layer is analogous to ReLU like layers present in the classical ConvNets. It aims to introduce non-linearity to SPD network. The ReEig for the  $k^{th}$  layer is defined as:  $\pmb{X}_k = \pmb{U}_{k - 1}\max (\epsilon \pmb {I},\Sigma_{k - 1})\pmb{U}_{k - 1}^T$  where,  $\pmb{X}_{k - 1} = \pmb{U}_{k - 1}\Sigma_{k - 1}\pmb{U}_{k - 1}^T$ $\pmb{I}$  is the identity matrix, and  $\epsilon$  is a rectification threshold value.  $U_{k - 1},\Sigma_{k - 1}$  are the orthonormal matrix and singular-value matrix respectively which are obtained via matrix factorization of  $\pmb{X}_{k - 1}$ .  
- LogEig layer: To map the manifold representation of SPD to flat space so that a Euclidean operation can be performed, LogEig layer is introduced. The LogEig layer is defined as:  $\mathbf{X}_k = \mathbf{U}_{k - 1}\log (\Sigma_{k - 1})\mathbf{U}_{k - 1}^T$  where,  $\mathbf{X}_{k - 1} = \mathbf{U}_{k - 1}\Sigma_{k - 1}\mathbf{U}_{k - 1}^T$ . The LogEig layer is used with fully connected layers to solve tasks with SPD representation.  
- ExpEig layer: This layer maps the corresponding SPD representation from flat space back to SPD manifold space. It is defined as  $\mathbf{X}_k = \mathbf{U}_{k - 1}\exp (\Sigma_{k - 1})\mathbf{U}_{k - 1}^T$  where,  $\mathbf{X}_{k - 1} = \mathbf{U}_{k - 1}\Sigma_{k - 1}\mathbf{U}_{k - 1}^T$ .  
- Weighted Riemannian pooling layer: It uses wFM definition to compute the output of the layer. Recent method use recursive geodesic mean algorithm to calculate the mean (Chakraborty et al., 2020), in contrast, we use Karcher flow algorithm to compute it (Karcher, 1977) as it is simple and widely used in practise.

# 3 NEURAL ARCHITECTURE SEARCH OF SPD MANIFOLD NETWORK

As alluded before, to solve the suggested problem, there are a few key changes that must be introduced. Firstly, a new definition of the computation cell is required. In contrast to the popular computational cell, our computational cell—which we call as SPD cell, must incorporate the notion of SPD manifold geometry while performing any operation. Similar to the basic NAS cell design, our SPD cell can either be a normal cell that returns SPD feature maps of the same width and height or, a reduction cell in which the SPD feature maps are reduced by a certain factor in width and height. Secondly, to solve our new NAS problem will require an appropriate and diverse SPD search space that can help NAS method to optimize for an effective SPD cell, which can then be stacked and trained to build an efficient SPD neural network architecture.

Concretely, a SPD cell is modeled by a directed asyclic graph (DAG) which is composed of nodes and edges. Each node is a latent representation of the SPD manifold valued data and, each edge corresponds to a valid candidate operation on SPD manifold (see Fig.1(a)). Each edge of a SPD cell is associated with a set of candidate SPD manifold operations  $(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}})$  that transforms the SPD valued latent representation from the source node (say  $X_{\mathcal{M}}^{(i)}$ ) to the target node (say  $X_{\mathcal{M}}^{(j)}$ ). We define the intermediate transformation between the nodes in our SPD cell as:  $X_{\mathcal{M}}^{(j)} = \operatorname*{argmin}_{\boldsymbol{X}_{\mathcal{M}}^{(j)}} \sum_{i < j} \delta_{\mathcal{M}}^{2}\left(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}}^{(i,j)}\left(\boldsymbol{X}_{\mathcal{M}}^{(i)}\right), \boldsymbol{X}_{\mathcal{M}}^{(j)}\right)$ , where  $\delta_{\mathcal{M}}$  denotes the geodesic distance Eq:(1).

Generally, this transformation result corresponds to the unweighted Fréchet mean of the operations based on the predecessors, such that the mixture of all operations still reside on SPD manifolds. Note that our definition of SPD cell ensures that each computational graph preserves the appropriate geometric structure of the SPD manifold. Equipped with the notion of SPD cell and its intermediate transformation, we are prepared to propose our search space (§3.1) followed by the solution to our SPDNet NAS problem (§3.2) and its results (§4).

# 3.1 SEARCH SPACE

Our search space consists of a set of valid SPD network operations which is defined for the supernet search. First of all, the search space includes some existing SPD operations<sup>1</sup>, e.g., BiMap, batch normalization, ReEig, LogEig, ExpEig and weighted Riemannian pooling layers, all of which are introduced in Sec.2. To be specific, following Liu et al. (2018b); Gong et al. (2019) traditional NAS methods, we apply the SPD batch normalization to every SPD convolution operation (i.e., BiMap), and design three variants of convolution blocks including the one without activation (i.e., ReEig), the one using post-activation and the one using pre-activation (see Table 1). In addition, we introduce five new operations analogous to DARTS (Liu et al., 2018b) to enrich the search space in the context of SPD networks. These are skip normal, none normal, average pooling, max pooling and skip reduced. Most of these operations are not fully explored for SPD networks. All the candidate operations are illustrated in Table (1), and the definitions of the new operations are detailed as follows:

(a) Skip normal: It preserves the input representation and is similar to skip connection. (b) None normal: It corresponds to the operation that returns identity as the output i.e, the notion of zero in the SPD space. (c) Max pooling: Given a set of SPD matrices, max pooling operation first projects these samples to a flat space via a LogEig operation, where a standard max pooling operation is performed.

Table 1: Search space for the proposed SPD architecture search method.  

<table><tr><td>Operation</td><td>Definition</td><td>Operation</td><td>Definition</td></tr><tr><td>BiMap_0</td><td>{BiMap, Batch Normalization}</td><td>WeightedReimannPooling_normal</td><td>{wFM on SPD multiple times}</td></tr><tr><td>BiMap_1</td><td>{BiMap,Batch Normalization, ReEig}</td><td>AveragePooling_reduced</td><td>{LogEig, AveragePooling, ExpEig}</td></tr><tr><td>BiMap_2</td><td>{ReEig, BiMap, Batch Normalization}</td><td>MaxPooling_reduced</td><td>{LogEig, MaxPooling, ExpEig}</td></tr><tr><td>Skip_normal</td><td>{Output same as input}</td><td>Skip_reduced = {C_in = BiMap(X_in), [U_in, D_in, ∼] = svd(C_in); in = 1, 2},</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>None_normal</td><td>{Return identity matrix}</td><td>C_out = U_bD_bU_b^T, where, U_b = diag(U_1, U_2) and D_b = diag(D_1, D_2)</td><td></td></tr></table>

Finally, an ExpEig operation is used to map the sample back to the SPD manifold. (d) Average pooling: Similar to Max pooling, the average pooling operation first projects the samples to the flat space using a LogEig operation, where a standard average pooling is employed. To map the sample back to SPD manifold, an ExpEig operation is used. (e) Skip reduced: It is similar to 'skip_normal' but in contrast, it decomposes the input into small matrices to reduces the inter-dependency between channels. Our definition of reduce operation is in line with the work of Liu et al. (2018b).

# 3.2 SUPERNET SEARCH

To solve the suggested new NAS problem, one of the most promising NAS methodologies is supernet modeling. While we can resort to some other NAS methods to solve the problem like reinforcement learning based method (Zoph & Le, 2016) or evolution based algorithm (Real et al., 2019), in general, the supernet method models the architecture search problem as a one-shot training process of a single supernet that consists of all architectures. Based on the supernet modeling, we can search for the optimal SPD neural architecture either using parameterization of architectures or sampling of single-path architectures. In this paper, we focus on the parameterization approach that is based on the continuous relaxation of the SPD neural architecture representation. Such an approach allows for an efficient search of architecture using the gradient descent approach. Next, we introduce our supernet search method, followed by a solution to our proposed bi-level optimization problem. Fig.1(b) and Fig.1(c) illustrates an overview of our proposed method.

To search for an optimal SPD architecture  $(\alpha)$ , we optimize the over parameterized supernet. In essence, it stacks the basic computation cells with the parameterized candidate operations from our search space in a one-shot search manner. The contribution of specific subnets to the supernet helps in deriving the optimal architecture from the supernet. Since the proposed operation search space is discrete in nature, we relax the explicit choice of an operation to make the search space continuous. To do so, we use wFM over all possible candidate operations. Mathematically,

$$
\bar {\mathcal {O}} _ {\mathcal {M}} \left(\boldsymbol {X} _ {\mathcal {M}}\right) = \underset {\boldsymbol {X} _ {\mathcal {M}} ^ {\mu}} {\operatorname {a r g m i n}} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {N _ {e}} \tilde {\alpha} ^ {k} \delta_ {\mathcal {M}} ^ {2} \left(\mathcal {O} _ {\mathcal {M}} ^ {(k)} \left(\boldsymbol {X} _ {\mathcal {M}}\right), \boldsymbol {X} _ {\mathcal {M}} ^ {\mu}\right); \text {s u b j e c t t o :} \boldsymbol {1} ^ {T} \tilde {\alpha} = 1, 0 \leq \tilde {\alpha} \leq 1 \tag {5}
$$

where,  $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}}^k$  is the  $k^{th}$  candidate operation between nodes,  $X_{\mu}$  is the intermediate SPD manifold mean (Eq.3) and,  $N_e$  denotes number of edges. We can compute wFM solution either using Karcher flow (Karcher, 1977) or recursive geodesic mean (Chakraborty et al., 2020) algorithm. Nonetheless, we adhere to Karcher flow algorithm as it is widely used to calculate  $\mathrm{wFM}^2$ . To impose the explicit convex constraint on  $\tilde{\alpha}$ , we project the solution onto the probability simplex as

$$
\underset {\alpha} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \| \alpha - \tilde {\alpha} \| _ {2} ^ {2}; \text {s u b j e c t t o :} \mathbf {1} ^ {T} \alpha = 1, 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 \tag {6}
$$

Eq:(6) enforces the explicit constraint on the weights to supply  $\alpha$  for our task and can easily be added as a convex layer in the framework (Agrawal et al., 2019). This projection is likely to reach the boundary of the simplex, in which case  $\alpha$  becomes sparse (Martins & Astudillo, 2016). Optionally, softmax, sigmoid and other regularization methods can be employed to satisfy the convex constraint. However, (Chu et al., 2020) has observed that the use of softmax can cause performance collapse and may lead to aggregation of skip connections. While Chu et al. (2020) suggested sigmoid can overcome the unfairness problem with softmax, it may output smoothly changed values which is hard to threshold for dropping redundant operations with non-marginal contributions to the supernet. Also, FairDARTS (Chu et al., 2020) regularization, may not preserve the summation equal to 1 constraint. Besides, Chakraborty et al. (2020) proposes recursive statistical approach to solve wFM with convex constraint, however, the definition proposed do not explicitly preserve the equality constraint and

Step1: Update  $\alpha$  (architecture) using Eq:(8) solution. Note that updates on  $w$  and  $\tilde{w}$  (Eq:(9), Eq:(10)) should follow the gradient descent on SPD manifold;

it requires re-normalization of the solution. In contrast, our approach composes of the sparsemax transformation for convex Fréchet mixture of SPD operations with the following two advantages: 1) It can preserve most of the important properties of softmax such as, it is simple to evaluate, cheaper to differentiate (Martins & Astudillo, 2016). 2) It is able to produce sparse distributions such that the best operation associated with each edge is more likely to make more dominant contributions to the supernet, and thus more optimal architecture can be derived (refer Figure 2(a),2(b) and §4).

From Eq.(5-6), the mixing of operations between nodes is determined by the weighted combination of alpha's  $(\alpha^k)$  and the set of operations. This relaxation makes the search space continuous and therefore, architecture search can be achieved by learning a set of alpha  $(\alpha = \{\alpha^k, \forall k \in N_e\})$ . To achieve our goal, we must simultaneously learn the contribution of several possible operations within all the mixed operations  $(w)$  and the corresponding architecture  $\alpha$ . Consequently, for a given  $w$ , we can find  $\alpha$  and vice-versa resulting in the following bi-level optimization problem.

$$
\underset {\alpha} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \boldsymbol {E} _ {v a l} ^ {U} (w ^ {o p t} (\alpha), \alpha); \text {s u b j e c t t o :} w ^ {o p t} (\alpha) = \underset {w} {\operatorname {a r g m i n}} \boldsymbol {E} _ {\text {t r a i n}} ^ {L} (w, \alpha) \tag {7}
$$

The lower-level optimization  $\pmb{E}_{train}^{L}$  corresponds to the optimal weight variable learned for a given  $\alpha$  i.e.,  $w^{opt}(\alpha)$  using a training loss. The upper-level optimization  $\pmb{E}_{val}^{U}$  solves for the variable  $\alpha$  given the optimal  $w$  using a validation loss. This bi-level search method gives optimal mixture of multiple small architectures. To derive each node in the discrete architecture, we maintain top-  $k$  operations i.e., with the  $k^{\text{th}}$  highest weight among all the candidate operations associated with all the previous nodes.

Bi-level Optimization: The bi-level optimization problem proposed in Eq.(7) is difficult to solve. Following Liu et al. (2018b) work, we approximate  $w^{opt}(\alpha)$  in the upper-optimization problem to skip inner-optimization as follows:

$$
\nabla_ {\alpha} \boldsymbol {E} _ {v a l} ^ {U} (w ^ {o p t} (\alpha), \alpha) \approx \nabla_ {\alpha} \boldsymbol {E} _ {v a l} ^ {U} (w - \eta \nabla_ {w} \boldsymbol {E} _ {\text {t r a i n}} ^ {L} (w, \alpha), \alpha) \tag {8}
$$

Here,  $\eta$  is the learning rate and  $\nabla$  is the gradient operator. Note that the gradient based optimization for  $w$  must follow the geometry of SPD manifold to update the structured connection weight, and its corresponding SPD matrix data. Applying the chain rule to Eq.(8) gives

$$

$$

where,  $\tilde{w} = \Psi_{\mathbf{r}}\big(w - \eta \tilde{\nabla}_{w}\pmb{E}_{train}^{L}(w,\alpha)\big)$  denotes the weight update on the SPD manifold for the forward model.  $\tilde{\nabla}_w$ ,  $\Psi_{\mathbf{r}}$  symbolizes the Riemannian gradient and the retraction operator respectively. The second term in the Eq:(9) involves second order differentials with very high computational complexity, hence, using the finite approximation method the second term of Eq:(9) reduces to:

$$
\nabla_ {\alpha , w} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {E} _ {t r a i n} ^ {L} (w, \alpha) \nabla_ {\tilde {w}} \boldsymbol {E} _ {v a l} ^ {U} (\tilde {w}, \alpha) = \left(\nabla_ {\alpha} \boldsymbol {E} _ {t r a i n} ^ {L} \left(w ^ {+}, \alpha\right) - \nabla_ {\alpha} \boldsymbol {E} _ {t r a i n} ^ {L} \left(w ^ {-}, \alpha\right)\right) / 2 \delta \tag {10}
$$

where,  $w^{\pm} = \Psi_{\mathbf{r}}(w \pm \delta \tilde{\nabla}_{\tilde{w}}E_{val}^{U}(\tilde{w},\alpha))$  and  $\delta$  is a small number set to  $0.01 / \| \nabla_{\tilde{w}}E_{val}^{U}(\tilde{w},\alpha)\|_{2}$ . For training SPD network, one must use the back-propagation in the context of Riemannian geometry of the SPD manifold. For concrete derivations on back-propagation for SPD network layers, refer to Huang & Van Gool (2017) work. The pseudo code of our method is outlined in Algorithm(1).

# 4 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

To keep the experimental evaluation consistent with the previously proposed SPD networks (Huang & Van Gool, 2017; Brooks et al., 2019), we used RADAR (Chen et al., 2006), HDM05 (Müller et al.,

![](images/30c9a61ebcc37bc9088adce26a3dd7fce08997f1c81323b3c4c4dd382695f608.jpg)

2007), and AFEW (Dhall et al., 2011) datasets. For SPDNetNAS, we first optimize the supernet on the training/validation sets, and then prune it with the best operation for each edge. Finally, we train the optimized architecture from scratch to document the results. For both these stages, we consider the same normal and reduction cells. A cell receives preprocessed inputs which is performed using fixed BiMap_2 to make the input of same initial dimension. All architectures are trained with a batch size of 30. Learning rate  $(\eta)$  for RADAR, HDM05, and AFEW dataset is set to 0.025, 0.025 and 0.05 respectively. Besides, we conducted experiments where we select architecture using a random search path (SPDNetNAS (R)), to justify whether our search space with the introduced SPD operations can derive meaningful architectures. We refer to SPDNet (Huang & Van Gool, 2017), SPDNetBN (Brooks et al., 2019), and ManifoldNet (Chakraborty et al., 2020) for comparison against handcrafted SPD networks. SPDNet and SPDNetBN are evaluated using their original implementations. We follow the video classification setup of (Chakraborty et al., 2020) to evaluate ManifoldNet on AFEW. It is non-trivial to adapt ManifoldNet to RADAR and HDM05, as ManifoldNet requires SPD features with multiple channels and both of the two datasets can hardly obtain them. For comparing against Euclidean NAS methods, we used DARTS (Liu et al., 2018b) and FairDARTS (Chu et al., 2020) by treating SPD's logarithm maps as Euclidean data in their official implementation with default setup. We observed that using raw SPD's as input to Euclidean NAS algorithms degrades its performance.

a) Drone Recognition: For this task, we used the RADAR dataset from (Chen et al., 2006). The synthetic setting for this dataset is composed of radar signals, where each signal is split into windows of length 20 resulting in a  $20 \times 20$  covariance matrix for each window (one radar data point). The synthesized dataset consists of 1000 data points per class. Given  $20 \times 20$  input covariance matrices, our reduction cell reduces them to  $10 \times 10$  matrices followed by normal cell to provide complexity to our network. Following Brooks et al. (2019), we assign  $50\%$ ,  $25\%$ , and  $25\%$  of the dataset for training, validation, and test set respectively. For this dataset, our algorithm takes 1 CPU day of search time to provide the SPD architecture. Training and validation take 9 CPU hours for 200 epochs<sup>3</sup>. Test results on this dataset are provided in Table (2) which clearly shows the benefit of our method. Statistical performance show that our NAS algorithm provides an efficient architecture with much fewer parameters (more than 140 times) than state-of-the-art Euclidean NAS on the SPD manifold valued data. The normal and reduction cells obtained on this dataset are shown in Fig. 2(b).  
b) Action Recognition: For this task, we used the HDM05 dataset (Müller et al., 2007) which contains 130 action classes, yet, for consistency with previous work (Brooks et al., 2019), we used 117 class for performance comparison. This dataset has 3D coordinates of 31 joints per frame. Following the previous works (Harandi et al., 2017; Huang & Van Gool, 2017), we model an action for a sequence using  $93 \times 93$  joint covariance matrix. The dataset has 2083 SPD matrices distributed among all 117 classes. Similar to the previous task, we split the dataset into  $50\%$ ,  $25\%$ , and  $25\%$  for training, validation, and testing. Here, our reduction cell is designed to reduce the matrices dimensions from 93 to 30 for legitimate comparison against Brooks et al. (2019). To search for the best architecture, we ran our algorithm for 50 epoch (3 CPU days). Figure 2(b) show the final cell architecture that got selected based on the validation performance. The optimal architecture is trained from scratch for 100 epochs which took approximately 16 CPU hours. The test accuracy achieved on this dataset is provided in Table (2). Statistics clearly show that our models despite being lighter performs better than the NAS models and the handcrafted SPDNets. The NAS models' inferior results show that the use of SPD layers for respecting SPD geometries is crucial for SPD data analysis.

Table 2: Performance comparison of our method against existing SPDNets and TraditionalNAS on drone and action recognition. SPDNetNAS (R): randomly select architecture from our search space, DARTS/FairDARTS: accepts logairthm forms of SPDs. The search time of our method on RADAR and HDM05 is noted to be 1 CPU days and 3 CPU days respectively. And the search cost of DARTS and FairDARTS on RADAR and HDM05 are about 8 GPU hours. #RADAR and #HDM05 show model parameter comparison on the respective dataset.

c) Emotion Recognition: We used AFEW dataset (Dhall et al., 2011) to evaluate the transferability of our searched architecture for emotion recognition. This dataset has 1345 videos of facial expressions classified into 7 distinct classes. To train on the video frames directly, we stack all the handcrafted SPDNets and our searched SPDNet on top of a covolutive network Meng et al. (2019) with its official implementation. For ManifoldNet, we compute a  $64 \times 64$  spatial covariance matrix for each frame on the intermediate CNN features of  $64 \times 56 \times 56$  (channels, height, width). We follow the reported setup of Chakraborty et al. (2020) to first apply a single wFM layer with kernel size 5, stride 3 and 8 channels, followed by three temporal wFM layers of kernel size 3 and stride 2, with the channels being 1, 4, 8 respectively. Since SPDNet, SPDNetBN and our SPDNetNAS require a single channel SPD matrix as input, we use the final 512 dimensional vector extracted from the covolutive network, project it using a dense layer to a 100 dimensional feature vector and compute a  $100 \times 100$  temporal covariance matrix. To study the transferability of our algorithm, we evaluate its searched architecture on RADAR and HDM05. In addition, we evaluate DARTS and FairDARTS directly on the video frames of AFEW. Table (3) reports the evaluations results. As we can observe, the transferred architectures can handle the new dataset quite convincingly, and their test accuracies are better than those of the existing SPDNets and the Euclidean NAS algorithms. In Appendix, we present results of competing methods and our searched models on the raw SPD features of AFEW.

# d) Ablation study:

Lastly, we conducted some ablation study to realize the effect of probability simplex constraint (sparsemax) on our suggested Fréchet mixture of SPD operations. Although in Fig. 2(a) we show better probability weight distribution with sparsemax, Table(4) shows that

Table 4: Ablations study on different solutions to our suggested Fréchet mixture of SPD operations.  

<table><tr><td>Dataset</td><td>softmax</td><td>sigmoid</td><td>sparsemax</td></tr><tr><td>RADAR</td><td>96.47% ± 0.10</td><td>97.70% ± 0.23</td><td>97.75% ± 0.30</td></tr><tr><td>HDM05</td><td>68.74% ± 0.93</td><td>68.64% ± 0.09</td><td>69.87% ± 0.31</td></tr></table>

it performs better empirically as well on both RADAR and HDM05 compared to the softmax and the sigmoid. Therefore, SPD architectures derived using the sparsemax is observed to be better.

# 5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION

In this work, we present a neural architecture search problem of SPD manifold networks. To solve it, a SPD cell representation and corresponding candidate operation search space is introduced. A parameterized supernet search method is employed to explore the relaxed continuous SPD search space following a bi-level optimization problem with probability simplex constraint for effective SPD network design. The solution to our proposed problem using back-propagation is carefully crafted, so that, the weight updates follow the geometry of the SPD manifold. Quantitative results on the benchmark dataset show a commendable performance gain over handcrafted SPD networks and Euclidean NAS algorithms. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned SPD architecture is much lighter than other NAS based architecture and, it is transferable to other datasets as well.

There can be many directions to improve our work, e.g., allowing SPDNetNAS to reduce the rigid constraints on the final architecture. Another possible task is to automate the design of SPD operation search space, presently, we manually define the set of possible candidate operations.
