# ABSTRACT

It is an important problem in trustworthy machine learning to recognize out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs which are inputs unrelated to the in-distribution task. Many out-of-distribution detection methods have been suggested in recent years. The goal of this paper is to recognize common objectives as well as to identify the implicit scoring functions of different OOD detection methods. In particular, we show that binary discrimination between in- and (different) out-distributions is equivalent to several different formulations of the OOD detection problem. When trained in a shared fashion with a standard classifier, this binary discriminator reaches an OOD detection performance similar to that of Outlier Exposure. Moreover, we show that the confidence loss which is used by Outlier Exposure has an implicit scoring function which differs in a non-trivial fashion from the theoretically optimal scoring function in the case where training and test out-distribution are the same, but is similar to the one used when training with an extra background class. In practice, when trained in exactly the same way, all these methods perform similarly and reach state-of-the-art OOD detection performance.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

While deep learning has significantly improved performance in many application domains, there are serious concerns for using deep neural networks in applications which are of safety-critical nature. With one major problem being adversarial samples (Szegedy et al., 2014; Madry et al., 2018), which are small imperceptible modifications of the image that change the decision of the classifier, another major problem is overconfident predictions (Nguyen et al., 2015; Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Hein et al., 2019) for images not belonging to the classes of the actual task. Here, one distinguishes between far out-of-distribution data, e.g. different forms of noise or completely unrelated tasks like CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN, and close out-of-distribution data which can for example occur in related image classification tasks where the semantic structure is very similar e.g. CIFAR-10 vs. CIFAR-100. Both are important to be distinguished from the in-distribution but it is conceivable that close out-of-distribution data is the more difficult problem with potentially fatal consequences: in an automated diagnosis system we want that the system recognizes that it "does not know" when a new unseen disease comes in rather than assigning high confidence into a known class leading to fatal treatment decisions. Thus out-of-distribution awareness is a key property of trustworthy AI systems.

One seemingly obvious approach is to use generative models for density estimation to differentiate between in- and out-distribution (Bishop, 1994; Nalisnick et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2019; Nalisnick et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2020). Recent methods to a certain extent overcome the problem mentioned in Nalisnick et al. (2019) that generative models can assign higher likelihood to distributions on which they have not been trained. Another line of work is score-based methods using an underlying classifier or the internal features of such a classifier, potentially combined with a generative model (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Liang et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018c; Hendrycks et al., 2019; Hein et al., 2019). One of the most effective methods up to now is Outlier Exposure (Hendrycks et al., 2019) and work building upon it (Chen et al., 2021; Meinke & Hein, 2020; Mohseni et al., 2020; Augustin et al., 2020; Papadopoulos et al., 2021; Thulasidasan et al., 2021) where a classifier is trained on the in-distribution task and one enforces low confidence as proposed by Lee et al. (2018a) during training on a large and diverse set of out-of-distribution images (Hendrycks et al., 2019) which can be seen as a proxy of all natural images. This approach generalizes well to other out-distributions. Recently, NTOM (Chen et al., 2021) has achieved excellent results for detecting far out-of-distribution

data by adding a background class to the classifier which is trained on samples from the surrogate out-distribution that are mined such that they show a desired hardness for the model. At test time, the output probability for that class is used to decide if an input is to be flagged as OOD. Their ATOM method does the same while also adding adversarial perturbations to the OOD inputs during training. Even though it has been claimed that new approaches outperform Hendrycks et al. (2019), up to our knowledge this has not been shown consistently across different and challenging test out-of-distribution datasets (including close and far out-of-distribution datasets).

The main contributions of this paper are:

- We show that several OOD detection approaches are equivalent to the binary discriminator between in- and out-distribution when analyzing the rankings induced by the Bayes optimal classifier/density.  
- We derive the implicit scoring functions for the confidence loss (Lee et al., 2018a) employed by Outlier Exposure (Hendrycks et al., 2019) and for using an additional background class for the out-distribution (Thulasidasan et al., 2021). The confidence scoring function turns out not to be equivalent to the "optimal" scoring function when training and test distributions are the same.  
- We show that when training the binary discriminator between in- and out-distribution together with a standard classifier on the in-distribution in a shared fashion, the binary discriminator reaches state-of-the-art OOD detection performance.

However, while we identify that a simple baseline is competitive with the state-of-the-art, the main aim of this paper is a better understanding of the key components of different OOD detection methods and to identify the key properties which lead to SOTA OOD detection performance. All of our findings are supported by extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with evaluation on various challenging out-of-distribution test datasets.

# 2 MODELS FOR OOD DATA AND EQUIVALENCE OF OOD DETECTION SCORES

As most work in the literature we consider OOD detection on a compact input domain  $X$  where the most important example is image classification where  $X = [0,1]^D$ . The most popular approach to OOD detection is the construction of an in-distribution-scoring function  $f: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}$  such that  $f(x)$  tends to be smaller if  $x$  is drawn from an out-distribution than if it is drawn from the in-distribution. There is a variety of different performance metrics for this task, with a very common one being the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC for a scoring function  $f$  distinguishing between an in-distribution  $p(x|i)$  and an out-distribution  $p(x|o)$  is given by

$$
\operatorname {A U C} _ {f} \left(p (x | i), p (x | o)\right) = \underset { \begin{array}{c} x \sim p (x | i) \\ y \sim p (y | o) \end{array} } {\mathbb {E}} \left[ \mathbb {1} _ {f (x) > f (y)} + \frac {1}{2} \mathbb {1} _ {f (x) = f (y)} \right]. \tag {1}
$$

We define an equivalence of scoring functions based on their AUCs and will show that this equivalence implies equality of other employed performance metrics as well.

Definition 1. Two scoring functions  $f$  and  $g$  are equivalent and we write  $f \cong g$  if

$$
\mathrm {A U C} _ {f} (p (x | i), p (x | o)) = \mathrm {A U C} _ {g} (p (x | i), p (x | o)) \tag {2}
$$

for all potential distributions  $p(x|i)$  and  $p(x|o)$ .

As the AUC is not dependent on the actual values of  $f$  but just on the ranking induced by  $f$  one obtains the following characterization of the equivalence of two scoring functions.

Theorem 1. Two scoring functions  $f, g$  are equivalent if and only if there exists a strictly monotonously increasing function  $\phi: \mathrm{range}(g) \to \mathrm{range}(f)$ , such that  $f = \phi(g)$ .

Corollary 1. The equivalence between scoring functions in Def. 1 is an equivalence relation.

Another metric is the false positive rate at a fixed true positive rate  $q$ , denoted as FPR@qTPR. A commonly used value for the TPR is  $95\%$ . The smaller the FPR@qTPR, the better the OOD discrimination performance.

Lemma 1. Two equivalent scoring functions  $f \cong g$  have the same FPR@qTPR for any pair of in- and out-distributions  $p(x|i), p(x|o)$  and for any chosen TPR  $q$ .

In the next section, we use the previous results to show that the Bayes optimal scoring functions of, several proposed methods for out-of-distribution detection are equivalent to the scoring functions of simple binary discriminators.

# 3 BAYES-OPTIMAL BEHAVIOUR OF BINARY DISCRIMINATORS AND COMMON OOD DETECTION METHODS

In the following we will show that the Bayes optimal function of several existing approaches to OOD detection for unlabeled data are equivalent to a binary discriminator between in- and a (training) out-distribution whereas differences arise when one has labeled data.

# 3.1 OOD DETECTION FOR METHODS USING UNLABELLED DATA ONLY

We first provide a formal definition of OOD detection before we show the equivalence of density estimators resp. likelihood to a binary discriminator.

The OOD problem In order to make rigorous statements about the OOD detection problem we first have to provide the mathematical basis for doing so. We assume that we are given an in-distribution  $p(x|i)$  and potentially also a training out-distribution  $p(x|o)$ . At this particular point no labeled data is involved, so both of them are just distributions over  $X$ . For simplicity we assume in the following that they both have a density wrt. the Lebesgue measure on  $X = [0,1]^d$ . We assume that in practice we get samples from the mixture distribution

$$
p (x) = p (x \mid i) p (i) + p (x \mid o) p (o) = p (x \mid i) p (i) + p (x \mid o) (1 - p (i)) \tag {3}
$$

where  $p(i)$  is the probability that we expect to see in-distribution samples in total. In order to make the decision between in-and out-distribution for a given point  $x$  it is then optimal to consider

$$
p (i | x) = \frac {p (x | i) p (i)}{p (x)} = \frac {p (x | i) p (i)}{p (x | i) p (i) + p (x | o) p (o)}, \tag {4}
$$

which is defined for all  $x \in [0,1]^d$  with  $p(x) > 0$  (assuming  $p(x|i)$  and  $p(x|o)$  can be written as densities). If the training out-distribution is also the test out-distribution then this is already optimal but we would like that the approach generalizes to other unseen test out-distributions and thus an important choice is the training out-distribution  $p(x|o)$ . Note that as  $p(i|x)$  is only well-defined for all  $x$  with  $p(x) > 0$ , it is thus reasonable to choose for  $p(x|o)$  a distribution with support in  $[0,1]^d$ , that is  $p(x|o) > 0$  for all  $x \in [0,1]^d$ . In this case we ensure that the criterion with which we perform OOD detection is defined for any possible input  $x$ . This is desirable as OOD detection should work for any possible input  $x \in X$ .

Optimal prediction of a binary discriminator between in- and out-distribution We consider a binary discriminator with model parameters  $\theta$  between in- and (training) out-distribution, where  $\hat{p}_{\theta}(i|x)$  is the predicted probability for the in-distribution. Under the assumption that  $p(i)$  is the probability for in-distribution samples and using cross-entropy (which in this case is the logistic loss up to a constant global factor of  $\log(2)$ ) the expected loss becomes:

$$
\min  _ {\theta} p (i) \underset {x \sim p (x \mid i)} {\mathbb {E}} [ - \log \hat {p} _ {\theta} (i \mid x) ] + p (o) \underset {x \sim p (x \mid o)} {\mathbb {E}} [ - \log (1 - \hat {p} _ {\theta} (i \mid x)) ]. \tag {5}
$$

One can derive that the Bayes optimal classifier minimizing the expected loss has the predictive distribution:

$$
\hat {p} _ {\theta^ {*}} (i | x) = \frac {p (x | i) p (i)}{p (x | i) p (i) + p (x | o) p (o)} = p (i | x). \tag {6}
$$

Thus at least for the training out-distribution a binary classifier based on samples from in- and (training) out-distribution would suffice to solve the OOD detection problem perfectly.

Equivalence of density estimation and binary discrimination for OOD detection In this section we further analyze the relationship of common OOD detection approaches with the binary discriminator between in-and out-distribution. We start with density estimators sourced from generative models. A basic approach that is known to yield relatively weak OOD performance (Nalisnick et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2020) is directly utilizing a model's estimate for the density  $p(x|i)$  at a sample input  $x$ .

An improved density based approach which uses perturbed in-distribution samples as a surrogate training out-distribution is the Likelihood Ratios method (Ren et al., 2019), which proposes to fit a generative model for both the in- and out-distribution and to use the ratio between the likelihoods output by the two models as a discriminative feature.

We show that with respect to the scoring function, the correct density  $p(x|i)$  is equivalent to the Bayes optimal prediction of a binary discriminator between the in-distribution and uniform noise. Furthermore, the density ratio  $\frac{p(x|i)}{p(x|o)}$  is equivalent to the prediction of a binary discriminator between the two distributions on which the respective models used for density estimation have been trained. Because of this equivalence, we argue that the use of binary discriminators is a simple alternative to these methods because of its easier training procedure. While this equivalence is an asymptotic statement, the experimental comparisons in the appendix show that the methods perform similarly poorly compared to the methods using labeled data.

We first prove the more general case of arbitrary likelihood ratios. In the following we use the abbreviation  $\lambda = \frac{p(o)}{p(i)}$  to save space and make the statements more concise.

Lemma 2. Assume that  $p(x|i)$  and  $p(x|o)$  can be represented by densities and the support of  $p(x|o)$  covers the whole input domain  $X$ . Then  $\frac{p(x|i)}{p(x|o)} \cong \frac{p(x|i)}{p(x|i) + \lambda p(x|o)}$  for any  $\lambda > 0$ .

This means that the likelihood ratio score of two optimal density estimators is equivalent to the in-distribution probability  $\hat{p}_{\theta^*}(i|x)$  predicted by a binary discriminator and this is true for any possible ratio of  $p(i)$  to  $p(o)$ . In the experiments below, we show that using such a discriminator has similar performance as the likelihood ratios of the different trained generative models.

For the approaches that try to directly use the likelihood of a generative model as a discriminative feature, this means that their objective is equivalent to training a binary discriminator against uniform noise, whose density is  $p_{\mathrm{Uniform}}(x) = p(x|o) = 1$  at any  $x$ .

Lemma 3. Assume that  $p(x|i)$  can be represented by a density. Then  $p(x|i) \cong \frac{p(x|i)}{p(x|i) + \lambda}$  for any  $\lambda > 0$ .

This provides additional evidence why a purely density based approach for many applications proves to be insufficient as an OOD detection score on the complex image domain: it is not reasonable to assume that a binary discriminator between certain classes of natural images on the one hand and uniform noise on the other hand provides much useful information about images from other classes or even about other nonsensical inputs.

# 3.2 OOD DETECTION FOR METHODS USING LABELED DATA

We first discuss how one can formulate the OOD problem when one has access to labeled data for the in-distribution and we identify the target distribution of OOD detection using a background/reject class. Then we derive the Bayes optimal classifier of the confidence loss (Lee et al., 2018a) as used by the most successful variant of Outlier Exposure (Hendrycks et al., 2019) and discuss the implicit scoring function. In most cases the scoring functions turn out not to be non-equivalent to  $p(i|x)$  (which is optimal if training and test out-distribution agree) as they integrate additional information from the classification task.

Bayes optimal solutions for OOD Detection with Background class and confidence loss Outlier Exposure Given a joint in-distribution  $p(y, x|i)$  (where  $y \in \{1, \dots, K\}$  given that we have  $K$  labels) for the labeled in-distribution, there are different ways how to come up with a joint distribution for in- and out-distribution. Interestingly, the different encodings used e.g. in training with a background class (Thulasidasan et al., 2021) vs. training a classifier with confidence loss (Lee et al.,

2018a) together with variants of the employed scoring function lead to methods which unexpectedly can have quite different behavior.

Background class: In this case we just put all out-of-distribution samples into a  $K + 1$ -class which is typically called background/reject class (Thulasidasan et al., 2021). The joint distribution then becomes

$$
p (y, x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} p (y, x | i) p (i) & \text {i f} y \in \{1, \ldots , K \}, \\ p (x | o) p (o) & \text {i f} y = K + 1. \end{array} \right.
$$

We denote by  $p(x|i) = \sum_{y=1}^{K} p(y, x|i)$  the marginal in-distribution and note that the marginal distribution of the joint distribution of in- and out-distribution is again given by

$$
p (x) = p (x | i) p (i) + p (x | o) p (o).
$$

Then we get the conditional distribution

$$
p (y | x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} p (y | x, i) p (i | x) & \text {i f} y \in \{1, \ldots , K \}, \\ p (o | x) = 1 - p (i | x) & \text {i f} y = K + 1. \end{array} \right.
$$

The Bayes optimal solution of training with a background class using any calibrated loss function  $L(y, f(x))$ , e.g. the cross-entropy loss (Laptev et al., 2016), then yields a Bayes optimal classifier  $f^{*}$  which has a predictive distribution  $p_{f^{*}}(y|x) = p(y|x)$ . There are two potential scoring functions that come to mind:

$$
s _ {1} (x) = 1 - p _ {f ^ {*}} (K + 1 | x) \text {a n d} s _ {2} (x) = \max  _ {k = 1, \dots , K} p _ {f ^ {*}} (k | x)
$$

The first one, used in Chen et al. (2021); Thulasidasan et al. (2021), is motivated by the fact that  $p_{f^*}(K + 1|x)$  is directly the predicted probability that the point is from the out-distribution as indeed it holds:  $s_1(x) = p(i|x)$  which is the optimal scoring function if training and test out-distribution are equal. On the other hand the maximal predicted probability  $\max_{k=1,\dots,K} p_{f^*}(k|x)$ , which is often employed as a scoring function Hendrycks & Gimpel (2017), becomes for the Bayes optimal classifier

$$
s_{2}(x) = p(i|x)\max_{k = 1,\ldots ,K}p(k|x,i),
$$

which is a product of  $p(i|x)$  and the maximal conditional probability of some class of the in-distribution (note that  $s_2$  is well defined as  $p(i|x)$  is defined if  $p(x|o)$  has support everywhere in  $X$  and if  $p(i|x) > 0$  then also  $p(x|i) > 0$ ). Thus the scoring function  $s_2(x)$  integrates additionally to  $p(i|x)$  also class-specific information and is thus less dependent on the chosen training out-distribution. In fact, one can see that  $s_2$  only ranks points high if both the binary discriminator and the classifier rank the corresponding point high. On the other hand in the case where training and test out-distribution are identical, this scoring function is not equivalent to  $p(i|x)$  and thus introduces a bias in the estimation.

Outlier Exposure Hendrycks et al. (2019) with confidence loss (Lee et al., 2018a): we analyze the Bayes optimal solution for the confidence loss (Lee et al., 2018a) that is used by Outlier Exposure (OE) and show that the associated scoring function can be written, similarly to the scoring function  $s_2(x)$  for training with a background class, as a function of  $p(i|x)$  and  $p(y|x,i)$ .

The training objective with the confidence loss is in expectation given by

$$
\min  _ {\theta} \underset {(x, y) \sim p (x, y | i)} {\mathbb {E}} \left[ \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {C E}} \left(f _ {\theta} (x), y\right) \right] + \lambda \underset {x \sim p (x | o)} {\mathbb {E}} \left[ \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {C E}} \left(f _ {\theta} (x), u ^ {K}\right) \right], \tag {7}
$$

where  $\theta$  are the model parameters and  $f_{\theta}(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{K}$  is the model output as logits, and  $u^{K} = \left(\frac{1}{K}, \dots, \frac{1}{K}\right)^{T}$  is the uniform distribution over the  $K$  classes of the in-distribution classification task. In the following theorem we derive the Bayes optimal predictive distribution for this training objective.

Theorem 2. The predictive distribution  $p_{f^*}(y|x)$  of the Bayes optimal classifier  $f^*$  minimizing the expected confidence loss is given for  $y \in \{1, \dots, K\}$  as

$$
p _ {f ^ {*}} (y | x) = p (i | x) p (y | x, i) + \frac {1}{K} (1 - p (i | x)). \tag {8}
$$

Thus the effective scoring function of using the probability of the predicted class as suggested in Hendrycks & Gimpel (2017); Lee et al. (2018a); Hendrycks et al. (2019) is given by

$$
s _ {3} (x) = p (i | x) \max  _ {y = 1, \dots , K} p (y | x, i) + \frac {1}{K} \big (1 - p (i | x) \big) = p (i | x) \Big [ \max  _ {y = 1, \dots , K} p (y | x, i) - \frac {1}{K} \Big ] + \frac {1}{K}.
$$

Please note that the term inside the brackets is positive as  $\max_{k = 1,\dots ,K}p(k|x,i)\geq \frac{1}{K}$ . Interestingly, the scoring functions  $s_2$  and  $s_3$  are not equivalent even though they look quite similar. In particular, due to the subtraction of  $\frac{1}{K}$  the scoring function  $s_3$  puts more emphasis on the classifier than  $s_2$ .

# 3.3 SEPARATE VERSUS SHARED ESTIMATION OF  $p(i|x)$  AND  $p(y|x,i)$

So far we have derived that at least from the point of view of the ranking induced by the Bayes optimal solution, OOD detection based on generative methods, likelihood ratios and the background class formulation with the scoring function  $s_1$  is equivalent to a binary classification problem between in- and out-distribution in order to estimate  $p(i|x)$ . The differences arise mainly in the choice of the training out-distribution  $p(x|o)$ : i) uniform for generative resp. density based methods, ii) a quite specific out-distribution for likelihood ratios (Ren et al., 2019) and iii) a proxy of the distribution of all natural images (Hendrycks et al., 2019; Thulasidasan et al., 2021).

On the other hand when labeled data is involved we can additionally train a classifier on the in-distribution in order to estimate  $p(y|x,i)$ . We will then combine the estimates of  $p(i|x)$  and  $p(y|x,i)$  according to the three scoring functions derived in the previous section and check if the novel OOD detection methods constructed in this way perform similar to the OOD methods from which we derived the corresponding scoring function i) OOD detection with a background class (Thulasidasan et al., 2021) or ii) using Outlier Exposure Hendrycks et al. (2019). This will allow us to differentiate between differences of the employed scoring functions for OOD detection and the estimators for the involved quantities. In this way we foster a more systematic approach to OOD detection.

In the unlabeled case we train simply the binary classifier  $p_{\theta} : [0,1]^d \to \mathbb{R}$  using logistic/cross entropy loss in a class balanced fashion

$$
\min  _ {\theta} - \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \log \left(\hat {p} _ {\theta} \left(i \mid x _ {i} ^ {\mathrm {I N}}\right)\right) - \frac {\lambda}{M} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {M} \log \left(1 - \hat {p} _ {\theta} \left(i \mid x _ {j} ^ {\mathrm {O U T}}\right)\right), \tag {9}
$$

where  $(x_{i}^{\mathrm{IN}})_{i = 1}^{N}$  and  $(x_{j}^{\mathrm{OUT}})_{j = 1}^{M}$  are samples from the in-distribution and the out-distribution.

In the case where we have labeled data we can additionally solve the classification problem. The obvious approach is to train the binary classifier for estimating  $p(i|x)$  and the classifier to estimate  $p(y|x, i)$  completely independently. Not surprisingly, we show in Section 4 that this approach works less well. In fact both tasks benefit from each other. Moreover, in training a neural network using a background class or with Outlier Exposure (Hendrycks et al., 2019) we are implicitly using a shared representation for both tasks which improves the results.

Thus we propose to train the binary discriminator of in-versus out-distribution together with the classifier on the in-distribution jointly. Concretely, we use a neural network with  $K + 1$  outputs where the first  $K$  outputs represent the classifier and the last output is the logit of the binary discriminator. The resulting shared problem can then be written as

$$
\min  _ {\theta} - \frac {1}{N _ {b}} \sum_ {r = 1} ^ {N _ {b}} \log \left(\hat {p} _ {\theta} \left(i \mid x _ {r} ^ {\mathrm {I N}}\right)\right) - \frac {\lambda}{M} \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {M} \log \left(1 - \hat {p} _ {\theta} \left(i \mid x _ {s} ^ {\mathrm {O U T}}\right)\right) - \frac {1}{N _ {c}} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {N _ {c}} \log \left(\hat {p} _ {\theta} \left(y _ {t} ^ {\mathrm {I N}} \mid x _ {t} ^ {\mathrm {I N}}\right)\right), \tag {10}
$$

where  $\lambda = \frac{p(o)}{p(i)}$  which is typically set to 1 during training in order to get a class-balanced problem.

Note that the in-distribution samples  $(x_{r}^{\mathrm{IN}})_{r = 1}^{N_{b}}$  used to estimate  $p(i|x)$  can be a super-set of the labeled examples  $(x_{t}^{\mathrm{IN}},y_{t}^{\mathrm{IN}})_{t = 1}^{N_{c}}$  used to train the classifier so that one can potentially integrate unlabeled data - this is an advantage compared to OOD detection with a background class or Outlier Exposure where this is not directly possible. We stress that the loss functions of the classifier and the discriminator act on independent outputs; the functions modelling the two tasks only interact with each other due to the shared network weights up to the final layer. Nevertheless, we see in the next Section 4 that training with a shared representation boosts both the classifier and the binary discriminator.

Table 1: Accuracy on the in-distribution (CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100) and FPR@95%TPR for various test out-distributions of different OOD methods with OpenImages as training out-distribution (results for the test set of OpenImages are not used in the mean FPR). Lower false positive rate is better. All methods except Mahalanobis have been trained using the same architecture, training parameters, schedule and augmentation.  $s_1$ ,  $s_2$ ,  $s_3$  are the scoring functions introduced in Section 3.2. Our binary discriminator (BINDISC) resp. the combination with the shared classifier (SHARED COMBI) and the models with background class (BGC) with scoring functions  $s_2$  or  $s_3$  outperform the Mahalanobis detector (Lee et al., 2018b) and are similar to Outlier Exposure (Hendrycks et al., 2019). CelebA makes no sense as test out-distribution for CIFAR-100 as man/woman are classes in CIFAR-100.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We use CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) datasets as in-distribution and OpenImages dataset (Krasin et al., 2017) as training out-distribution. The 80 Million Tiny Images (80M) dataset (Torralba et al., 2008) is the de facto standard for training out-distribution aware models that has been adopted by most prior works, but this dataset has been withdrawn by the authors as Birhane & Prabhu (2021) pointed out the presence of offensive images. To be able to compare with other state-of-the-art methods without introducing a potential bias due to dataset selection, we include the evaluation with 80M as training out-distribution in Appendix F. Moreover, we show in the appendix results for the binary discriminator trained with different training out-distributions vs. likelihoods resp. likelihood ratios (Ren et al., 2019) as OOD method.

We use as OOD detection metric the false positive rate at  $95\%$  true positive rate, FPR@95%TPR; evaluations with AUC are in Appendix E. We evaluate the OOD detection performance on the following datasets: SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), resized LSUN Classroom (Yu et al., 2015), Uniform Noise, Smooth Noise generated as described by (Hein et al., 2019), the respective other CIFAR dataset, 80M, and CelebA (Liu et al., 2015). We highlight that none of the listed methods has access

to those test distributions during training or for fine-tuning as we try to assess the ability of an out-distribution aware model to generalize to unseen distributions. The FPR for the OpenImages test set is not included in the Mean AUC, since this distribution has been used during training.

The binary discriminators (BINDISC) as well as the classifiers with background class (BGC) and the shared binary discriminator+classifier (SHARED) of  $p(i|x)$  and  $p(y|x, i)$  are trained on the 40-2 Wide Residual Network (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) architecture with the same training schedule as used in Hendrycks et al. (2019) for training their Outlier Exposure(OE) models. This includes averaging the loss over batches that are twice as large for the out-distribution. This way we ensure that the differences do not arise due to differences in the training schedules or other important details but only on the employed objectives. In addition to their standard augmentation and normalization, we apply AutoAugment (Cubuk et al., 2019) without Cutout, and we use  $\lambda = 1$  where applicable. For the Mahalanobis OOD detector (Lee et al., 2018b), we use the models and code published by the authors and use OpenImages for the fine tuning of input noise and layer weighting regression. We describe the exact details of the training settings and the used dataset splits in Appendix C.

# 4.1 OUT-DISTRIBUTION AWARE TRAINING WITH LABELED IN-DISTRIBUTION DATA

In Table 1 we compare multiple OOD methods trained with training out-distribution OpenImages and CIFAR-10/100 as in-distribution: confidence of standard training (PLAIN) and OE, MAHALANOBIS detection, classifier with background class (BGC) and the combination of a plain classifier and a binary in-vs-out-distribution classifier with shared representation (SHARED COMBI). As described in Section 2, both BGC and SHARED COMBI can be used in combination with different scoring functions. For BGC, we evaluate all three scoring functions  $s_1$ ,  $s_2$  and  $s_3$  and for SHARED COMBI we only use  $s_2$  and  $s_3$  as  $s_1$  is equivalent to  $p(i|x)$  which is the output of SHARED BINDISC. Additionally, we evaluate OOD detection based on the confidence of the shared classifier (SHARED CLASSI) trained together with SHARED BINDISC.

For CIFAR-10, a first interesting observation is that SHARED CLASSI has remarkably good OOD performance; significantly better than a normal classifier (plain) even though it is just trained using normal cross-entropy loss and so the OOD performance is only due to the regularization enforced by the shared representation with SHARED BINDISC. In fact SHARED BINDISC has already good OOD performance with a mean FPR@95%TPR of 19.56, which is improved by considering scoring function  $s_2 / s_3$  in the combination of SHARED BINDISC and SHARED CLASSI which yields very good classification accuracy and mean FPR/AUC. Moreover, interesting are the results of the classifier with background class (BGC) which is the method recently advocated in Thulasidasan et al. (2021). It works very well but the performance depends on the chosen scoring function. Whereas  $s_1$  (output of the background class) is a usable scoring function (mean FPR: 18.83), the maximum probability over the other classes  $s_2$  (mean FPR: 16.52) or the combination in terms of  $s_3$  (mean FPR: 16.63) performs better. In total with the scoring function  $s_2 / s_3$  integrating classifier and discriminative information, BGC reaches similar performance to OE (which implicitly also uses  $s_3$  as scoring function). In general, the differences of the methods are relatively minor both in terms of OOD detection and classification accuracy, where the latter is better for all OOD methods compared to the plain classifier; this is most likely explained by better learned representations, see also Hendrycks et al. (2019); Augustin et al. (2020) for similar observations. The results for CIFAR-100 are similar to CIFAR-10, with some reversals of the overall rankings of the compared methods. OE achieves comparable OOD results to BGC  $s_2 / s_3$  and SHARED COMBI  $s_2 / s_3$ . For this in-distribution our BGC  $s_1$  and SHARED BINDISC perform best in terms of OOD performance. Classification test accuracy is slightly higher for BGC and SHARED, but the differences are minor. The experiments with 80M as training out-distribution (Table 7 in Appendix F) confirm these observations.

Overall, as suggested by the theoretical results on the equivalence of the Bayes optimal classifier of OE with the  $s_3$  scoring function of BGC and SHARED COMBI, we observe that even though these methods are derived and in particular trained with quite different objectives, they behave very similar in our experiments. In total we think that this provides a much better understanding where differences of OOD methods are coming from. Regarding the question of which method and scoring function should be used for a given application, the experimental results across datasets and different out-distributions, see Appendix F, suggest that their difference is minor and there is no clear best choice. However, in Appendix B, we describe a potential situation where the  $s_3$  score and in consequence OE is not powerful enough to distinguish in- and out-of-distribution inputs. On the other

hand, in cases where the  $s_1$  score is not very informative as training and test out-distributions largely differ, combining it with the classifier confidence is beneficial; this can be observed in experiments with SVHN as training out-distribution which we show in Appendix G. This is why for an unknown situation, we recommend BGC or SHARED COMBI with the  $s_2$  scoring function as the safest option. However, it is an open question if there are also situations where  $s_2$  is fundamentally inferior to  $s_3$ .

# 4.2 SHARED REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR THE BINARY DISCRIMINATOR

As highlighted above the shared training of SHARED CLASSI and SHARED BINDISC and their combination SHARED COMBI with  $s_2 / s_3$  as scoring functions yields strong OOD detection and test accuracy among all methods. Here, we evaluate the importance of training the binary discriminator and the plain classifier with a shared representation in comparison to training two entirely separate models PLAIN CLASSI and SEPARATE BINDISC and their combination SEPARATE COMBI with scoring function  $s_3$ . The results for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 can be found in Table 2. In total, we see that separate training in particular for CIFAR-100 leads to worse results compared to shared training as expected as the binary discriminator and the classifier cannot benefit from each other. An interesting curiosity is that the combination of the separate classifier with the binary discriminator trained in a shared fashion (PLAIN  $\otimes$  SHA DISC) yields almost the same OOD results as SHARED COMBI even though the classifier is significantly worse. Overall, SHARED COMBI performs significantly better when also considering the better classification accuracy which it inherits from SHARED CLASSI.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper we have analyzed different OOD detection methods and have shown that the simple baseline of a binary discriminator between in-and out-distribution is a powerful OOD detection method if trained in a shared fashion with a classifier. Moreover, we have revealed the inner mechanism of Outlier Exposure and training with a background class which unexpectedly use a scoring function which integrates information from  $p(i|x)$  and  $p(y|x,i)$ . We think that these findings will allow to build novel OOD methods in a more principled fashion.

# 6 ETHICS AND REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

In this paper we provide an explanation for the inner workings of established OOD detection methods and propose a novel OOD detection method based on these considerations which outperforms OE in terms of OOD performance and test accuracy. A limitation is that our derived equivalences are based on the Bayes optimal solution and thus are asymptotic statements. Convergence to the Bayes optimal solution can be infinitely slow and the methods can have implicit inductive biases.

The final goal is to have more trustworthy classifiers. One could criticize that the focus on OOD FPR/AUC performance and test accuracy covers just certain aspects and other aspects like calibration of the classifiers, fairness, robustness to corruptions or adversarial attacks play an important role, too. However, apart from the usual dual use problem we see only positive societal aspects of our paper, as it leads to more trustworthy ML methods.

We discuss the problematic situation with the retracted 80 Million Tiny Images (Torralba et al., 2008) dataset – which is used by many previous works in the field – in Appendix F and replace the it with Openimages (Krasin et al., 2017) for training the models in the main paper. For comparability with previous methods, we include evaluations of models trained on 80M in the appendix. We hope that introducing an alternative dataset for natural surrogate OOD training helps the community towards avoiding the retracted dataset in the future, both from an ethical and also a practical perspective, in case 80M becomes fully unavailable.

All experimental details including used hardware are given in Appendix C, and code for training and evaluating out methods as well as weights of the evaluated neural networks are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/0OD_BGC_BinDisc-D7FB.
