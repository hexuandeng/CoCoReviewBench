# ABSTRACT

Deep learning architectures have been shown to be severely affected by adversarial examples. Previous work has focused mostly on the application of adversarial examples to various classification tasks. Deep generative models have recently become very popular due to their great ability to model input data distributions. In this paper, we study the effect of adversarial examples on generative models such as the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the VAE-GAN. We design a way to attack both the VAE and VAE-GAN and as a result, our adversarial examples can make the generative models incorrectly reconstruct input images, such that the reconstructions more closely resemble the instances of incorrect classes. All this shows that adversarial examples are a general phenomenon for neural networks and that generative models can also be easily attacked.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Adversarial examples have been shown to exist for a variety of deep learning architectures. They are small perturbations of the original inputs, often barely visible to a human observer, but carefully crafted to misguide the deep architecture into producing incorrect outputs. Recent work by Goodfellow et al. (2014) and Szegedy et al. (2013) has shown that adversarial examples are abundant and finding them is easy. At the same time, they have shown to be very effective in attacking deep classification networks.

Most previous work focused only on the application of adversarial examples to the task of classification, where the output of a deep network is used to assign classes to input images. In this case, the attack adds small adversarial perturbations (which are often invisible to humans) to the original input image, resulting in an adversarial example. And while the original image is classified correctly by the network, the adversarial example is misclassified with high confidence.

On the other side, deep generative models (Kingma & Welling (2013)) have recently become popular, showing an amazing ability to generate a variety of patterns, ranging from handwritten digits to faces (Kulkarni et al. (2015)), realistic scenes (Oord et al. (2016)), videos (Kalchbrenner et al. (2016)) and even 3D objects (Dosovitskiy et al. (2016)). They all work by attempting to model the distribution of the input data in different ways, allowing one to then sample from this distribution in order to generate previously unseen outputs, which resemble the input data.

One of the most basic applications of generative models is input reconstruction. Given an input image, one part of the model first encodes it into a lower-dimensional latent representation so that the second part can sample this latent information and generate back a reconstruction of the original input image. This simple architecture allows for many different applications. Since the latent representation usually has much fewer dimensions than the original input, it can be used as a form of compression. Generative models can also be used to manipulate images through changing the latent representation e.g., to remove certain features etc.

A possible attack on a compression scheme that uses a generative model is one where two parties exchange a compressed form of an image. The sending party uses the encoder to compress the image and then transmits the latent representation to the received, which uses the decoder to decompress the image. An attacker may be able to introduce adversarial perturbations on the sender side, so that they will not be apparent to the sender, who will see the original image before sending it to the receiver. But in case of a successful attack, the image will be reconstructed quite differently by the receiver.

Figure 1: Variational autoencoder architecture.

In this paper, we investigate adversarial examples against generative models. In particular, given an input set of labeled images, we want to see if adversarial examples can be used on the image reconstruction task in order to make the generative model reconstruct an image belonging to a different class. Since the latent representation has a direct effect on the features that will be present in the final reconstructed image, we attempt to make the model change the latent representation by crafting adversarial examples which achieve this goal. More specifically, we construct a two-stage attack on the variational autoencoder architecture (VAE) by Kingma & Welling (2013) and the VAE-GAN architecture by Larsen et al. (2015). While the VAE is a simpler model, the VAE-GAN model has been shown to produce very high quality reconstructions.

In the first stage we augment the victim network in a way that enables generation of adversarial examples, which can mislead the generative model into reconstructing images of the wrong class. The second stage then uses the augmented network to generate adversarial examples for the victim generative model. We show that adversarial examples can be successfully used to make both VAE and VAE-GAN incorrectly reconstruct input images so that they more closely resemble instances of incorrect classes. This shows that adversarial examples are a general phenomenon for neural networks and that generative models can also be easily attacked.

# 2 PROBLEM DEFINITION

In this section we define the generative model that we use (VAE) and what exactly does it mean to generate adversarial examples against it.

# 2.1 BACKGROUND AND GENERAL SETTING OF VAE

The general architecture of a variational autoencoder is composed of three components as shown in Figure 1

- Encoder  $f_{\mathrm{enc}}(x)$ . A function (neural network), which maps a high-dimensional input representation  $x$  into a lower-dimensional latent representation  $z$ .  
- Latent representation  $z$ . A compressed (continuous) representation of  $x$ . All possible values that  $z$  can take form a latent space, and vectors close in this space usually (if the model can capture a good approximation of the input distribution) correspond to some similar features of  $x$ .  
- Decoder/generator  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}(z)$ . A function (neural network), which maps the compressed latent representation back to some high-dimensional output  $\hat{x}$ .

A key point in a variational autoencoder is its loss function  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VAE}}$ , which enables the autoencoder to learn a latent representation that models the prior distribution  $p(z|x)$ , while achieving a good reconstruction accuracy:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {V A E}} = - D _ {\mathrm {K L}} [ q (z | x) | | p (z) ] + E _ {q} \left[ \log p (x | z) \right]. \tag {1}
$$

Here,  $q(z|x)$  is an approximation of the posterior distribution  $p(z|x)$ ,  $p(z)$  is the prior distribution of latent representation,  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$  denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence and  $E_q[\log p(x|z)]$  is the reconstruction loss, that is cross-entropy  $H(x,\hat{x})$  between the input  $x$  and its reconstructed version  $\hat{x}$ . In order to derive  $\hat{x}$ , which is needed to compute the reconstruction loss, the VAE needs to sample  $q(z|x)$  and then compute  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}(z)$  on the sampled  $z$ . Stacking these components in an end-to-end architecture gives us a way to reconstruct an approximation of  $x$  by computing  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}(f_{\mathrm{enc}}(x))$ . In order for the VAE to be end-to-end differentiable despite the use of random sampling from  $q(z|x)$  in the middle, a so-called reparametrization trick is used to perform this step in a differentiable manner. In case of the Gaussian distribution, the encoder component outputs  $\mu$  and  $\sigma^2$ , which is then sampled by computing  $\mu + \varepsilon \sqrt{\sigma^2}$  where  $\varepsilon \sim N(0,1)$ .

Figure 2: Depiction of the attack scenario. The VAE is used as a compression scheme to transmit a latent representation of the image from the sender (left) to the receiver (right).

Note that the above definition is general and can be used for both VAE and VAE-GAN (Larsen et al. (2015)), with slight modifications. More specifically, the VAE-GAN architecture also features the  $f_{\mathrm{enc}}$  and  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}$  pair as in VAE, but it adds a discriminator that is only used during training as in GANs. The other major architecture difference are the loss functions of the encoder and decoder, which use the discriminator loss instead of simple cross-entropy for estimating the reconstruction error. But since the encoder and decoder components are similar and so is the latent representation, we can apply this problem definition generally.

This general architecture can be used for a variety of tasks. For example, with input denoising, the encoder is given a noisy representation  $x'$  and the autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the original  $x$ , minimizing the difference  $||x - \hat{x}||$ . More interestingly, the VAE can also be used as a generative model by sampling  $z$  values from the latent space and using just the decoder part on the sampled values to compute  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}(z)$ . Since the VAE models the prior distribution of input data well, sampling from  $q(z|x)$  and running the decoder gives us outputs  $\hat{x}$ , which realistically look like instances of the input data  $x$ .

# 2.2 EXAMPLE ATTACK SCENARIO

In order to place the presented attacks into context, we present an example attack scenario where the generative model is used as a compression scheme. In this scenario, we have two principals: the sender and the receiver. The sender would like to transmit a compressed version of an image to the receiver. Both the sender and the receiver have access to the encoder  $f_{\mathrm{enc}}$  and the decoder  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}$  based on a generative model like a VAE (see Figure 2).

The attacker introduces an image to the sender, who doesn't notice that a small adversarial perturbation has been added to the image and thus expects that the receiver will see a similar image. The sender gives this image as input to  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}$  to produce the compressed representation, which is transmitted to the receiver over a communication channel. The receiver passes the compressed version through the decoder to decompress the received data. But the decompressed image looks different than the original in a way that changes its semantics (e.g. instead of the number 3, number 8 is shown instead).

# 2.3 PROBLEM DEFINITION OF GENERATING ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES AGAINST LATENT REPRESENTATION AND RECONSTRUCTIONS

Generating adversarial examples for the classification task has already been clearly defined in the existing literature, e.g., by Goodfellow et al. (2014). Given a classifier  $f(x)$  and an original input  $x$ , with some ground truth label  $y$ , the problem of generating adversarial examples is to find inputs  $x^{\star}$ , such that  $x^{\star}$  is close to  $x$  in some distance measure (e.g., the mean squared error between  $x$  and  $x^{\star}$  should be low), while  $f(x^{\star}) \neq y$ .

For generating adversarial examples for generative models, we consider the following setting. We consider the victim has trained a generative model such as a VAE. We also assume that the inputs to the generative model in general comes from a number of different classes. The ground truth labels of the inputs may not be used in training the generative model. The attacker's goal is to generate adversarial examples to cause the victim's generative model to reconstruct outputs of the wrong class, while given the original images, the generative model generates reconstructions of the correct class.

More specifically, we define an adversarial example against the latent space and reconstructions of a generative model as the following. Given a trained generative model  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}(f_{\mathrm{enc}}(\cdot))$  and an

![](images/1deade684e572b48da155d36e160c6ec5d765564e3313581e779f7b6f88760fa.jpg)  
Figure 3: Depiction of the architecture used for generating adversarial examples. The VAE part is the victim's pre-trained architecture, which is frozen during training of the classifier. The end-to-end architecture  $x \to f_{\mathrm{enc}} \to z \to f_{\mathrm{class}} \to y$  is used to generate adversarial examples.

original input  $x$  which comes from class  $y$ , and the generative model reconstructs  $\hat{x} = f_{\mathrm{dec}}(f_{\mathrm{enc}}(x))$  correctly ( $\hat{x}$  looks like coming from class  $y$ ), the attacker's goal is to find an input  $x^{\star}$  close to  $x$  given some distance measure (such as the mean squared error), and achieves that the reconstruction  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}(f_{\mathrm{enc}}(x^{\star}))$  looks more like belonging to another class  $y' \neq y$  instead of looking like belonging to  $y$ . This definition maps nicely to the example attack scenario outlined in Section 2.2.

One additional problem here is how to define that one reconstruction looks more like something from another class. One way to evaluate the effectiveness of an attack is for a human to look at the reconstructed images and make a subjective measure of how wrong the reconstruction is.

# 3 ATTACK METHODOLOGY

In this section we present the general attack methodology and apply it to both the VAE and the VAE-GAN generative models.

# 3.1 GENERAL VAE

The Naive Method. In order to construct an attack that will satisfy the definition from Section 2.3, a straightforward way one may consider would be to just use the existing adversarial example generation methods using the loss function  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VAE}}$  and attack the VAE directly. However, intuitively speaking, using this loss function may not allow the attacker to control the latent representation and the reconstruction process to enable successful attacks. In Section 4 we will show results demonstrating that this approach does not achieve the goal outlined in the problem statement, namely that we do not get reconstructions which resemble different classes.

In order to construct an attack that will satisfy the definition from Section 2.3, the attacker ideally would like to construct an adversarially-perturbed input to influence the decoded latent representation in a way that will cause the reconstruction process to reconstruct an output for a different class. However, it is difficult to construct an effective loss function for this purpose using the latent representation or the output directly. This challenge motivates us to propose a new approach for the attack as the following.

Our Approach. The approach that we propose is to add a classifier  $f_{\mathrm{class}}$  to the pre-trained VAE, similar to the process of semi-supervised learning in Kingma et al. (2014). The weights of the pre-trained VAE are frozen, and the classifier is trained on top of the VAE encoder, as shown in Figure 3. In this architecture, we add a classifier network after the encoder part of the VAE, trained to classify based on the sampled latent representation  $z$ . Note that even though the architecture of adding the classifier and the process of training the classifier is similar to semi-supervised learning proposed previously by Kingma et al. (2014), the purpose here is completely different. In our case, the attacker trains the classifier for a victim's pre-trained VAE and then uses the trained classifier to generate adversarial examples for the latent space and the reconstruction of the victim's pre-trained VAE. Note that this process is independent of how the original VAE is trained.

Step 1 of Attack. Thus, the first step of our proposed approach is to train a classifier network on top of the victim's pre-trained VAE. The attacker trains the classifier to classify based on the latent representation provided by  $f_{\mathrm{enc}}(x)$ , using the classifier loss function  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{classifier}}$ . In particular, the attacker can just use the cross-entropy loss, assuming that the classifier uses softmax on the output layer.

Step 2 of Attack. After the classifier is trained, the second step of our proposed attack is to generate adversarial examples for this combined network. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 3. By augmenting the VAE with a classifier in this way and with a corresponding loss function, we now have everything set up to generate adversarial examples as the proposed model architecture is end-to-end differentiable.

The attack can be used either in targeted (where we want a specific class to be reconstructed) or non-targeted (where we just want an incorrect class to be reconstructed) mode. In this paper, we only consider a non-targeted mode of attack. The targeted mode is similar and we leave that for future work.

We can use a number of different methods to generate the adversarial example. Here we use the fast gradient sign method as an example. Introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), the fast gradient sign method works by computing the gradient of the loss function based on the inputs and moving in the direction of the sign of the gradient. Since the method only requires computing the gradient once, it can generate adversarial examples very fast. Using this method and our trained classifier in Step 1, we compute the adversarial example as the following:

$$
x ^ {\star} = x + \beta \operatorname {s i g n} \left(\nabla_ {x} \mathcal {L} _ {\text {c l a s s i f i e r}} (x, y)\right). \tag {2}
$$

Where  $\beta$  is the wanted noise intensity factor, based on the scale that is used to represent inputs  $x$ , while  $y$  are the ground truth classes (encoded appropriately for the loss function, eg. as 1-hot vectors) corresponding to samples  $x$ .

# 3.2 VAE-GAN

![](images/fe0e8d9d73f1d3200709ea4bb0fdb761f622c8a7bcc38775ffbaf153a5d77ff9.jpg)  
Figure 4: Depiction of the architecture used for generating adversarial examples on VAE-GAN. The VAE-GAN part is the victim's pre-trained architecture, which is frozen during training of the classifier. The end-to-end architecture  $x \to f_{\mathrm{enc}} \to z \to f_{\mathrm{class}} \to y$  is used to generate adversarial examples.

The method can also be naturally adapted to the setting of VAE-GAN. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the VAE-GAN architecture also contains the encoder and decoder components. The attack proceeds in exactly the same way as in the case of a simple VAE, using  $f_{\mathrm{enc}}$  and  $f_{\mathrm{dec}}$  defined by the VAE-GAN. As the attack assumes a pre-trained VAE-GAN, we don't need to do anything with the discriminator (see Figure 4).

# 4 EVALUATION

For our experiments, we build an implementation of the described architecture using TensorFlow (Abadi & et al. (2015)) and evaluate it on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (LeCun et al. (1998)). We use a 60,000 example training set and a 10,000 example validation set when training the VAE/VAE-GAN and the classifier. Adam with learning rate 0.001 and other parameters set to default values is used as the optimizer. Both VAE and VAE-GAN by themselves reconstruct the

Figure 6: Results when using adversarial noise generated with the naive method by using  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VAE}}$  directly. Shown are the reconstructions of adversarial examples produced by VAE (left) and VAE-GAN (right). Note the difference in reconstructions compared to Figure 8 (top). With VAE, no reconstructions change classes while with VAE-GAN only two images do change classes.

original inputs perfectly as show in Figure 5. As a control, we also generate random noise of the same magnitude as used for the adversarial examples (see Figure 9), to show that random noise does not cause the reconstructed noisy images to change in any significant way.

For the VAE, we use a simple architecture with a single fully-connected hidden layer with 512 units and ReLU activation function. We use the same VAE-GAN architecture as is described in the original paper by Larsen et al. (2015). For both VAE and VAE-GAN we use a 50-dimensional latent representation.

Using the VAE loss directly. In Section 3 we mentioned that naively using  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VAE}}$  directly does not give the desired results. We generated adversarial noise using the fast gradient sign method described in Section 3.1 ( $\beta$  was set to 0.1) together with  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VAE}}$  on the original VAE architecture.

The results are shown in Figure 6. Notice how the VAE reconstructions look blurry and faded, but still resemble instances of the same class to a human observer. In the case of VAE-GAN, the reconstructions do appear to change the class in two out of a hundred cases, most likely due to a more continuous latent space, which is also the reason why the reconstructions by VAE-GAN are not blurry.

Figure 7: A display of some of the more interesting reconstructions among the first 30 images from the MNIST validation set. First column contains the original image, second is the generative model reconstruction of the original image, third is the adversarial example and fourth is the generative model reconstruction of the adversarial example. Ground truth labels are obvious, while the labels predicted by the classifier from latent representations of adversarial examples are shown in red. Results from VAE are in the top three rows, while the bottom three contain the results from VAE-GAN. A full set of adversarial examples and their reconstructions for the first 100 images from the MNIST validation set are shown in Figure 8.

Using the proposed attack methodology. We use a simple classifier architecture, consisting of two fully-connected hidden layers with 512 units each and ReLU activation function. The output layer is a 10-way softmax. On the input, the classifier takes the 50-dimensional latent representation produced by the VAE/VAE-GAN encoder. After convergence, the classifier achieves  $98.5\%$  accuracy on the validation set. We then construct adversarial examples from the validation set using the fast gradient sign method, setting the  $\beta$  parameter to 0.1. We plot some of the more interesting reconstructions of adversarial examples among the first 30 images from the MNIST validation set in Figure 7 and present the full set of the first 100 images in Figure 8.

Looking at Figure 7, we see that reconstructions of adversarial examples produced by VAE-GAN are much better in quality and less blurry than those produced by the simple VAE architecture. This can be most probably attributed to the fact that the VAE-GAN model is more powerful and can produce better quality images in general. At the same time, the improved quality means that the reconstructed adversarial examples look even more convincing – a human looking at the reconstructions shown in the last column would never suspect that they have been switched. In the simple VAE case we can see how the reconstructions add some minimal amount of pixels needed to transform the correct image into an incorrect one, while the VAE-GAN reconstructions can be completely different.

All these results show that in some cases of adversarial examples, both VAE and VAE-GAN are successfully tricked into producing completely different digits as their reconstructions. In these cases, the reconstructed image is also easily misclassified by a human observer, especially in case of VAE-GAN.

# 5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we have studied adversarial examples when applied to generative networks such as the VAE and VAE-GAN. We have proposed an architecture that can be used for attacking the latent space and thus the output reconstructions of a generative model. The evaluation results have shown that using the proposed architecture is beneficial in tricking the generative model into reconstructing images of incorrect classes.

While this paper focused on using the proposed architecture together with the fast gradient sign method, in the future we want to look into optimization-based attacks (Carlini & Wagner (2016)), which may generate even better results. Additionally, we only dealt with untargeted attacks and we expect to also explore targeted attacks in future work.
