# ABSTRACT

We consider a dynamic assortment selection and pricing problem in which a seller has  $n$  different items available for sale. In each round, the seller observes  $d$ -dimensional contextual preference information for the user and offers to the user an assortment of  $K$  items at prices chosen by the seller. The user selects at most one of the products from the offered assortment according to a multinomial logit choice model whose parameters are unknown. The seller observes which, if any, item is chosen at the end of each round, with a goal of maximizing cumulative revenue over a selling horizon of length  $T$ . For this problem, we propose an algorithm that learns from user feedback and achieves  $n$ -independent revenue regret of order  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ . We also show that this regret rate is optimal, up to logarithmic factors, by obtaining lower bounds for the regret achievable by any algorithm.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In online marketplaces, dynamic assortment selection and pricing for sequentially arriving buyers presents a challenging context for online learning. Since the preferences of buyers are varying and uncertain, adaptive strategies are essential to meet their needs and maximize the effectiveness of offers. To address this problem, we investigate the application of online learning techniques for contextual assortment selection and pricing. Assortment selection involves the seller choosing a subset of items from a vast catalog to present to buyers, and dynamically assigning prices to the offered items. The overall goal is to maximize revenue over the course of repeated interactions.

Dynamic assortment selection and pricing strategies are deployed in a variety of online sectors including e-commerce (e.g., Amazon, eBay), travel (e.g., Expedia), hospitality (e.g., Airbnb), and food delivery (e.g., Doordash). With similar systems becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives, there is a growing opportunity to deliver tailored product recommendations and pricing adjustments. Therefore, it is crucial to consider data-driven approaches that can enhance user experiences and boost profitability in today's highly competitive digital industry.

We consider designing sequential assortment selection and pricing algorithms that offer a sequence of menus (assortments) of up to  $K$  items from a catalog (set) of  $n$  possible items. The learning agent (seller) makes sequential decisions and receives human (user) feedback. The feedback at each round is the particular item chosen by the user from the offered assortment. We assume that the item choice follows a multinomial logistic (MNL) model (McFadden, 1978), which is one of the most widely used models in dynamic assortment optimization literature (Caro & Gallien, 2007; Rusmevichientong et al., 2010; Saure & Zeevi, 2013; Agrawal et al., 2017; Aouad et al., 2018; Agrawal et al., 2019). Because assortment-based offers are relevant to many industries that involve access to additional information about users, contextual assortment selection models have gained significant traction in recent years (Chen et al., 2020; Oh & Iyengar, 2021). In alignment with this approach, we assume that the utility parameters in the MNL choice model are linear functions of  $d$ -dimensional context vectors that are revealed at each round.

To faithfully address a range of real-world scenarios where price optimization is essential for maximal revenue, we incorporate the pricing of items in the offered assortment as a second component of the seller's problem. This differs from most, if not all, previous literature on sequential assortment selection, wherein prices (or revenues) are assumed to be predetermined for each item in the catalog.

Figure 1: A seller has access to a set (catalog) of  $n = 6$  distinct items, from which it can advertise to sequentially arriving users. In each round, the seller offers an assortment of  $K = 3$  items at well-chosen prices. The user selects one of the products from the offered assortment (represented with a green background), or rejects all offered items (represented with a red background).

In the process of offering a sequence of assortments with judiciously chosen prices, the seller's goal is to maximize the expected revenue accumulated over a time horizon of  $T$  rounds. However, since the seller does not have knowledge of the parameters of the contextual choice model ahead of time, it encounters the dilemma of exploration vs. exploitation. In particular, the seller's decisions involve a trade-off between learning the choice model in order to increase long-term revenues and earning short-term revenues by leveraging the already-acquired information.

We tackle this challenge by developing an upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm that computes tight upper bounds for the utility parameters in the MNL model. Then, using these upper bounds, it calculates optimistic allocations and pricing vectors that strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. Consistent with the sequential decision-making literature, we measure the performance of algorithms using a relevant notion of regret, defined as the difference between the expected revenue generated by the algorithm and the offline optimal expected revenue when all parameters are known. We show that our algorithm enjoys a revenue regret of order  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ , which, as we show, is the best possible up to logarithmic factors in  $d$  and  $T$ .

# 1.1 RELATED WORKS

Generalized Linear Bandits: For sequential decision-making with contextual information, linear bandits, generalized linear bandits, and their variants have been widely studied (Rushevichientong & Tsitsiklis, 2010; Abbasi-Yadkori, 2011; Chu et al., 2011; Li et al., 2017). Nonetheless, these methods are limited to modeling the single-item selection scenario, which is becoming less common in practice compared to the multiple-item offering scenarios that we focus on in this work. There is a line of literature that considers combinatorial variants of the contextual bandit problem mostly with semi-bandit or cascading feedback (Chen et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2014; Kveton et al., 2015; Zong et al., 2016). However, these methods fail to capture the substitution effects since they do not take the user choice model into account. In contrast, the item choice (feedback) that we consider under the multinomial logit (MNL) model is a function of all items in the offered assortment as well as their prices.

MNL Bandits: There has been an emerging body of literature on multinomial logit (MNL) bandits in both non-contextual (Cheung & Simchi-Levi, 2017; Agrawal et al., 2017; 2019) and contextual settings (Chen et al., 2020; Oh & Iyengar, 2021). While these studies address the sequential assortment selection problem under the MNL choice model, their algorithms exclusively operate based on the assumption of fixed prices (or revenues) for the items. Consequently, they do not account for the potential effects of price optimization strategies that could be employed when presenting items to consumers.

Table 1: Comparison of related works and provided regret bounds.  $T$  is the number of rounds,  $K$  is the assortment size,  $n$  is the total number of items,  $d$  is the feature dimension. The big-  $\mathcal{O}$  and big-  $\Omega$  notations denote the regret upper and lower bounds, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to jointly address the problems of contextual assortment selection and pricing.

Bandits for Dynamic Pricing: The problem of dynamic pricing has been typically modeled as a variant of the multi-armed bandit problem that aims to maximize revenue from selling copies of a single good to sequentially arriving users (Kleinberg & Leighton, 2003; Besbes & Zeevi, 2009; Bubeck et al., 2019; Paes Leme & Schneider, 2018; Xu & Wang, 2021). However, all of these works address the pricing problem of offering a single item in each round. Our contribution stands out by considering the combinatorial aspect of the assortment selection problem faced in simultaneously offering multiple items, a factor that was not taken into account in most of the prior literature on dynamic pricing. A recent study by Javanmard et al. (2020) considers the problem of pricing multiple items that are offered under the MNL choice model. However, in contrast to our work, their framework assumes that all available items are offered to the buyer and hence the seller does not need to decide on an assortment as a part of its actions. In their work, they propose an almost-optimal algorithm that can achieve  $\mathcal{O}(\log(Td)\sqrt{T})$  regret for their pricing-only setting. Comparing this result with the regret lower bound of order  $\Omega(d\sqrt{T})$  for our problem, we see that the problem of dynamic assortment selection and pricing is fundamentally harder. Another recent study by Perivier & Goyal (2022) also considers the problem of pricing multiple items that are offered under the MNL choice model with the additional assumption of an adversarial arrival model for users. Similarly, they also do not consider assortment selection decisions while optimizing the prices of the items.

Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback: The framework of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has recently gained popularity through its empirical success in aligning human values with machine learning systems, including InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). The central goal of RLHF is to learn the rewards of different actions using human feedback that is received in the form of pairwise or  $K$ -wise comparisons between actions. Notably, in many deployments of RLHF, the human feedback is modeled through the Plackett-Luce (PL) model which is equivalent to the multinomial logit (MNL) choice model that we employ in our analysis (Luce, 2012; Liu, 2009; Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023).

# 1.2 OUR CONTRIBUTIONS

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of dynamic contextual assortment selection and pricing. Our contributions are as follows:

- We introduce and formalize the problem of sequential assortment selection and pricing under contextual MNL choice probabilities.  
- We develop an upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm for the contextual assortment selection and pricing problem (Algorithm 2). We show that it achieves  $n$ -independent  $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$  regret in  $T$  rounds where  $d$  is the dimension of the context vectors.  
- We further improve the time and space complexity of our algorithm by leveraging online Newton step (ONS) techniques for parameter estimation.  
- We show that for any algorithm, there exists an adversarial problem instance such that it incurs  $\Omega(d\sqrt{T})$  regret. Therefore, Algorithm 2 enjoys optimal regret up to logarithmic terms in  $d$  and  $T$ .

# 2 PROBLEM DEFINITION

Notation: We use bold lowercase font for vectors  $\pmb{x}$  and uppercase font for matrices  $X$ . For a vector  $\pmb{x}$ , we denote its  $i$ -th entry by  $x_{i}$  and we use  $\| \pmb{x} \|$  to denote its  $\ell^2$ -norm. For two vectors  $\pmb{x}$  and  $\pmb{y}$ , we use  $(\pmb{x}; \pmb{y})$  to denote their concatenation and use  $\langle \pmb{x}, \pmb{y} \rangle$  to denote their inner product. For a vector  $\pmb{x}$  and a positive semi-definite matrix  $W$ , we use  $\| \pmb{x} \|_W$  to denote the weighted  $\ell^2$ -norm. For any positive integer  $n$ , we use  $[n]$  to denote the set  $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ .

We consider the problem of online assortment selection and pricing for selling items to sequentially arriving buyers. We denote the set of available items by  $[n]$  and consider that the seller is constrained to offer at most  $K$  items to each buyer. Accordingly, we let  $\mathcal{S}_K \coloneqq \{S \subseteq [n] : |S| \leq K\}$  denote the set of all possible assortments that the seller can choose to offer.

At each time  $t \in [T]$ , the seller observes random feature vectors  $\pmb{x}_{ti} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  for each item  $i \in [n]$ . Given this contextual information, the seller offers an assortment of items  $S_t \in S_K$  and chooses a price  $p_{ti} \in \mathbb{R}_+$  for each offered item  $i \in S_t$ . At the end of each round  $t$ , the seller observes only the purchase decision  $i_t \in S_t \cup \{0\}$  of the buyer and obtains revenue  $p_{ti_t}$ . Here,  $\{0\}$  represents the no-purchase option (or outside option), which indicates that the user did not choose any item offered in  $S_t$ , resulting in revenue  $p_{t0} = 0$ .

For convenience, we let  $\pmb{p}_t \in \mathbb{R}_+^n$  denote the collection of prices chosen for all items where the prices are set to  $p_{ti} = 0$  for items that are not offered, i.e.  $i \notin S_t$ .

For a given assortment  $S_{t}$  and price vector  $\pmb{p}_{t}$ , the buyer's decision  $i_{t}$  is a categorical random variable with support  $S_{t} \cup \{0\}$ . We model this decision via the widely used multinomial logit (MNL) choice model (McFadden, 1978) under a linear utility function. Formally, the choice probability for each item  $i \in S_{t}$  (and the no-purchase option) is assumed to be given as in the following assumption.

Assumption 1 (Multinomial logit choice under linear utility). The utility of the buyer at time  $t$  for item  $i$  is given by the linear model

$$
u _ {t i} (p) = \left\langle \psi^ {*}, \boldsymbol {x} _ {t i} \right\rangle - \left\langle \phi^ {*}, \boldsymbol {x} _ {t i} \right\rangle \cdot p
$$

where  $\psi^{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$  and  $\phi^{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$  are time-invariant parameter vectors unknown to the seller agent. In this model, the  $\alpha_{ti} \coloneqq \langle \psi^{*}, \boldsymbol{x}_{ti} \rangle$  term represents the buyer's base valuation of the item while the  $\beta_{ti} \coloneqq \langle \phi^{*}, \boldsymbol{x}_{ti} \rangle$  term represents the buyer's price sensitivity.

Then, given an assortment  $S_{t}$  with prices  $\pmb{p}_{t}$ , the probability that the buyer selects item  $i \in S_{t}$  is

$$
q _ {t} (i \mid S _ {t}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t}) := \frac {\exp \left\{u _ {t i} \left(p _ {t i}\right) \right\}}{1 + \sum_ {j \in S _ {t}} \exp \left\{u _ {t j} \left(p _ {t j}\right) \right\}}, i \in S _ {t}.
$$

Consequently, the probability of no purchase is

$$
q _ {t} \left(0 \mid S _ {t}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t}\right) := \frac {1}{1 + \sum_ {j \in S _ {t}} \exp \left\{u _ {t j} \left(p _ {t j}\right) \right\}}.
$$

Under the MNL model, the expected revenue at time  $t$  is given by

$$
R _ {t} \left(S _ {t}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t}\right) := \sum_ {i \in S _ {t}} p _ {t i} \cdot q _ {t} (i \mid S _ {t}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t}) \tag {1}
$$

for any selection of assortment  $S_{t} \in S_{K}$  and price vector  $\pmb{p}_{t} \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ . Thus, for a sequence of assortments  $S_{t} \in S_{K}$  and price vectors  $\pmb{p}_{t} \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$  chosen for each time  $t \in [T]$ , the cumulative expected revenue can be written as  $\sum_{t=1}^{T} R_{t}(S_{t}, \pmb{p}_{t})$ .

After the seller decides on the assortment  $S_{t} \in \mathcal{S}_{K}$  and prices  $\pmb{p}_t \in \mathbb{R}_+^n$  to offer to the user at each time  $t$ , the user reports the item  $i_t \in S_t \cup \{0\}$  that they have decided to purchase. We denote by  $H_{t}$  the history  $\{\{\pmb{x}_{\tau i}\}_{i \in [n]}, S_{\tau}, \pmb{p}_{\tau}, i_{\tau}\}_{\tau = 1}^{t - 1}$  of observations available to the seller when choosing the next set of assortment  $S_{t} \in \mathcal{S}_{K}$  along with the next price vector  $\pmb{p}_t$ . Then, the seller agent employs a policy  $\pmb{\pi} = \{\pi^t | t \in [T]\}$ , which is a sequence of functions, each mapping the history  $H_{t}$  and the context vectors  $\{\pmb{x}_{ti}\}_{i \in [n]}$  to an action  $(S_{t}, \pmb{p}_{t}) \in S_{K} \times \mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ .

Given the contextual information at every round  $t$ , the task of the seller is to sequentially offer the items to users at well-chosen prices such that it can achieve maximal revenue. To evaluate policies in achieving this objective, we define the regret metric that measures the gap between the expected revenue of policy  $\pi$  and that of the offline optimal sequence of assortments and prices. The regret  $\mathcal{R}_T$  for a time horizon of  $T$  periods is defined as

$$
\mathcal {R} _ {T} := \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} R _ {t} \left(S _ {t} ^ {*}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t} ^ {*}\right) - \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} R _ {t} \left(S _ {t}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t}\right),
$$

where  $(S_t^*,\pmb{p}_t^*)$  denotes an offline optimal assortment and price selection that satisfies

$$
\left(S _ {t} ^ {*}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t} ^ {*}\right) \in \underset { \begin{array}{c} S \in \mathcal {S} _ {K} \\ \boldsymbol {p} \in \mathbb {R} _ {+} ^ {n} \end{array} } {\arg \max } R _ {t} (S, \boldsymbol {p}). \tag {2}
$$

Based on this definition of the regret metric, we see that regret minimization is equivalent to maximizing the cumulative expected revenue.

# 3 OPTIMAL ASSORTMENT SELECTION AND PRICING

As stated in Assumption 1, we assume that buyers' purchase decisions are given by a multinomial logit (MNL) model. Therefore, the assortment and price optimization at time  $t$  can be formulated as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \max  _ { \begin{array}{l} S _ {t} \in \mathcal {S} _ {K} \\ \boldsymbol {p} _ {t} \in \mathbb {R} _ {+} ^ {n} \end{array} } R _ {t} \left(S _ {t}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t}\right) = \max  _ { \begin{array}{l} S _ {t} \in \mathcal {S} _ {K} \\ \boldsymbol {p} _ {t} \in \mathbb {R} _ {+} ^ {n} \end{array} } \sum_ {i \in S _ {t}} p _ {t i} \cdot q _ {t} (i | S _ {t}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t}) (3) \\ = \max  _ {\substack {S _ {t} \in S _ {K} \\ \boldsymbol {p} _ {t} \in \mathbb {R} _ {+} ^ {n}}} \frac {\sum_ {i \in S _ {t}} p _ {t i} \exp \left\{u _ {t i} \left(p _ {t i}\right) \right\}}{1 + \sum_ {j \in S _ {t}} \exp \left\{u _ {t j} \left(p _ {t j}\right) \right\}}. (4) \\ \end{array}
$$

We also recall that the utility functions are given by linear form  $u_{ti}(p) = \alpha_{ti} - \beta_{ti}p$  where  $\alpha_{ti} = \langle \boldsymbol{\psi}^*, \boldsymbol{x}_{ti} \rangle$  and  $\beta_{ti} = \langle \boldsymbol{\phi}^*, \boldsymbol{x}_{ti} \rangle$ .

Next, we make the following regularity assumption.

Assumption 2. There exists a constant  $L_0 > 0$  such that price sensitivity  $\beta_{ti} = \langle \phi^*, \pmb{x}_{ti} \rangle$  satisfies  $\beta_{ti} \geq L_0$  for all  $t \in [T]$  and  $i \in [n]$ , almost surely.

This assumption ensures that the utility function  $u_{ti}(p)$  is decreasing in price and hence infinity is a so-called null price, i.e.  $\lim_{p\to \infty}pe^{u_{ti}(p)} = 0$  for all  $i\in [n]$ . This property is crucial in ensuring that the objective function in equation 4 has a finite maximum. Because if we had  $\langle \phi^*,\boldsymbol{x}_{ti}\rangle \leq 0$  for some  $i\in S_t$ , we would have  $\lim_{p\to \infty}pe^{u_{ti}(p)} = \infty$  and hence, letting  $p_{ti}\rightarrow \infty$  would cause the objective function (i.e., expected revenue) to increase without bound. To avoid this complication, we make the regularity assumption given in Assumption 2.

Under the MNL choice model with known linear utility functions, Wang (2013) shows that the optimum assortment and prices can be characterized as in the following proposition.

Proposition 1 (Optimum assortments and prices). Under linear utility functions  $u_{ti}(p) = \alpha_{ti} - \beta_{ti}p$  with  $\beta_{ti} > 0$  for all  $i \in [n]$ , the optimum prices are given by

$$
p _ {t i} ^ {*} = \frac {1}{\beta_ {t i}} + B _ {t},
$$

where  $B_{t}$  is defined to be the unique solution of the fixed point equation

$$
B = \max  _ {S \in \mathcal {S} _ {K}} \sum_ {i \in S} v _ {t i} (B) \tag {5}
$$

for  $v_{ti}(B) \coloneqq e^{\alpha_{ti} - \beta_{ti}B - 1} / \beta_{ti}$ . Furthermore, the optimum assortment  $S_{t}^{*}$  is the assortment  $S$  that achieves the maximum in the optimization problem in equation 5, and the optimum revenue achieved by  $(S_{t}^{*},\pmb{p}_{t}^{*})$  is equal to  $B_{t}$ .

To solve the fixed point equation given in equation 5, we observe that  $v_{ti}(B)$  is a strictly decreasing function in  $B$  for any  $i \in [n]$ . Hence, we can show that the right-hand side of equation 5 is a strictly decreasing function in  $B$ , implying that it has a unique fixed point.

As we will show in Lemma 1, our regularity assumptions ensure that this fixed point lies in the interval  $[0, P_0]$  for some finite  $P_0$ . Therefore, we can appeal to a binary search algorithm over the interval  $[0, P_0]$  to find the fixed point. Since each iteration of this binary search algorithm requires us to compute  $v_{ti}(B)$  value for all  $i \in [n]$ , it has a computational complexity of  $\mathcal{O}(n)$ . For the sake of completeness and future reference, we describe this procedure in Algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1 Assortment selection and pricing for linear utility functions  
1: Input: Accuracy parameter  $\epsilon$ , search interval  $[0, P_0]$ , utility parameters  $\alpha_{ti}$  and  $\beta_{ti}$  for  $i \in [n]$

3: while  $B_r - B_\ell > \epsilon$  do  
4:  $B \gets (B_r + B_\ell)/2$   
5: if  $B > \max_{S \in S_K} \sum_{i \in S} v_{ti}(B)$  then  $B_r \gets B$  else  $B_\ell \gets B$   
6: Output:  $B$

# 4 METHODOLOGY

In this section, we discuss how to estimate parameters based on user choices, introduce our assortment selection and pricing algorithms, and provide their regret bounds.

# 4.1 MLE FOR MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION

Since the seller does not have access to problem parameters  $\psi^{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$  and  $\phi^{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ , it cannot directly compute the optimum assortments and prices given by Proposition 1. Therefore, it needs to construct an estimate of the parameters based on the history  $H_{t}$  of observations. In this work, we consider a policy that uses the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the parameters as we briefly describe in this section.

For convenience, we let  $\pmb{\theta} = (\psi; \phi)$  and  $\widetilde{\pmb{x}}_{ti} = (\pmb{x}_{ti}; -p_{ti}\pmb{x}_{ti})$  denote the extended parameter and feature vectors such that

$$
\langle \boldsymbol {\theta}, \widetilde {\boldsymbol {x}} _ {t i} \rangle = \langle \boldsymbol {\psi}, \boldsymbol {x} _ {t i} \rangle - \langle \boldsymbol {\phi}, \boldsymbol {x} _ {t i} \rangle \cdot p _ {t i}.
$$

Then, we write the MNL choice probabilities under parameter  $\theta = (\psi ;\phi)$  using the notation

$$
q _ {t} (i | S _ {t}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t}; \boldsymbol {\theta}) = \frac {\exp \{\langle \boldsymbol {\psi} , \boldsymbol {x} _ {t i} \rangle - \langle \boldsymbol {\phi} , \boldsymbol {x} _ {t i} \rangle \cdot p _ {t i} \}}{1 + \sum_ {j \in S _ {t}} \exp \{\langle \boldsymbol {\psi} , \boldsymbol {x} _ {t j} \rangle - \langle \boldsymbol {\phi} , \boldsymbol {x} _ {t j} \rangle \cdot p _ {t j} \}} = \frac {e ^ {\langle \boldsymbol {\theta} , \widetilde {\boldsymbol {x}} _ {t i} \rangle}}{1 + \sum_ {j \in S _ {t}} e ^ {\langle \boldsymbol {\theta} , \widetilde {\boldsymbol {x}} _ {\tau j} \rangle}}.
$$

Based on the observations up to time  $t$ , the negative log-likelihood function is given by

$$
\ell_ {t} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) := - \sum_ {\tau = 1} ^ {t - 1} \log q _ {\tau} (i _ {\tau} | S _ {\tau}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {\tau}; \boldsymbol {\theta}),
$$

which is also known as the cross-entropy error function for the multi-class classification problem. Then, as we formalize in the next proposition, the maximum likelihood estimate is given as the minimizer of the negative log-likelihood function.

Proposition 2. The maximum likelihood estimator is any parameter  $\widehat{\pmb{\theta}}_t$  that minimizes the negative log-likelihood function over the parameter space, that is

$$
\widehat {\boldsymbol {\theta}} _ {t} \in \underset {\boldsymbol {\theta}} {\arg \min } \ell_ {t} (\boldsymbol {\theta}). \tag {6}
$$

The negative log-likelihood function  $\ell_t(\pmb{\theta})$  is convex over  $\pmb{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ . Therefore, any parameter  $\widehat{\pmb{\theta}}_t$  that satisfies the first order optimality condition  $\nabla_{\pmb{\theta}} \ell_t(\widehat{\pmb{\theta}}_t) = 0$  is a maximum likelihood estimate.

Furthermore, if the Gram matrix  $V_{t-1} = \sum_{\tau=1}^{t-1} \sum_{i \in S_{\tau}} \widetilde{\boldsymbol{x}}_{\tau i} \widetilde{\boldsymbol{x}}_{\tau i}^{\top}$  is positive definite, then  $\ell_t(\boldsymbol{\theta})$  is strongly convex and thus admits a unique minimizer.

Since the negative log-likelihood function is convex over  $\pmb{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ , we can use gradient-based convex optimization methods to find an MLE solution (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004).

# 4.2 ALGORITHM

The basic idea of our algorithm is to construct an upper confidence bound for the revenue function  $R_{t}(S, \pmb{p})$ . The upper confidence bound (UCB) techniques and the optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) principle have been widely known to be effective in balancing the exploration and exploitation in many bandit problems, including multi-armed bandits (Lattimore & Szepesvári, 2020), linear bandits (Dani et al., 2008; Abbasi-Yadmori, 2011) and generalized linear bandits (Li et al., 2017).

At each round  $t$ , our algorithm determines the assortments and prices according to the OFU principle in order to ensure low regret. In particular, we construct a pointwise confidence upper bound  $h_{ti}(p)$  for each utility function  $u_{ti}(p)$ , i.e.,  $h_{ti}(p) \geq u_{ti}(p)$  for all  $p \in \mathbb{R}_+$  with high probability.

In this construction, we use the maximum likelihood estimate  $\widehat{\theta}_t = (\widehat{\psi}_t,\widehat{\phi}_t)$  calculated by solving the maximum likelihood problem described above in equation 6. Then, given the MLE of the parameters, the obtained upper bound is of the form

$$
h _ {t i} (p) = \min \{\langle \widehat {\psi} _ {t}, \boldsymbol {x} _ {t i} \rangle + g _ {t i}, 1 \} - \max \{\langle \widehat {\phi} _ {t}, \boldsymbol {x} _ {t i} \rangle - g _ {t i}, L _ {0} \} \cdot p,
$$

where  $g_{ti} = \alpha_t\| (\pmb{x}_{ti},\pmb{x}_{ti})\|_{V_t^{-1}}$  is the confidence bonus for some confidence radius  $\alpha_{t}$ . As a result, we can replace each  $u_{ti}(p)$  in equation 1 with  $h_{ti}(p)$  to obtain the revenue function upper bound

$$
\widetilde {R} _ {t} (S, \boldsymbol {p}) := \frac {\sum_ {i \in S _ {t}} p _ {t i} \exp \left\{h _ {t i} \left(p _ {t i}\right) \right\}}{1 + \sum_ {j \in S _ {t}} \exp \left\{h _ {t j} \left(p _ {t j}\right) \right\}}. \tag {7}
$$

As we verify in proving our regret bounds, this estimate satisfies  $\widetilde{R}_t(S,\pmb {p})\geq R_t(S,\pmb {p})$  for any  $S\in S_K$  and any  $\pmb {p}\in \mathbb{R}_+^n$ . Using  $\widetilde{R}_t$  as a proxy for  $R_{t}$ , we choose the assortment and prices according to

$$
(S _ {t}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {t}) \in \underset { \begin{array}{c} S \in \mathcal {S} _ {K} \\ \boldsymbol {p} \in \mathbb {R} _ {+} ^ {n} \end{array} } {\arg \max } \widetilde {R} _ {t} (S, \boldsymbol {p}). \tag {8}
$$

As discussed in Section 3, we can solve this optimization problem using the binary search method described in Algorithm 1 with estimated linear functions  $h_{ti}(p)$ .

# 4.3 REGRET ANALYSIS

Our main result presented in Theorem 3 concerns the regret upper bound for Algorithm 2. We show this result under the following assumption on the context process which is a standard assumption made in the generalized linear bandit (Li et al., 2017) and MNL contextual bandit (Chen et al., 2020; Oh & Iyengar, 2021) literature.

Assumption 3 (Stochastic and bounded features). Each feature vector  $\pmb{x}_{ti}$  is an independent random variable with unknown distribution; they satisfy  $\| \pmb{x}_{ti}\| \leq 1$ , and there exists a constant  $\sigma_0 > 0$  such that  $\mathbb{E}[\pmb{x}_{ti}\pmb{x}_{ti}^{\top}] \succ \sigma_0\pmb{I}$ . Furthermore, parameter vectors satisfy  $\| (\pmb{\theta}^{*},\pmb{\phi}^{*})\| \leq 1$ .

Accordingly, we can demonstrate in Theorem 3 that Algorithm 2 enjoys  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$  regret bound in terms of key problem primitives  $n$ ,  $d$  and  $T$ . This regret rate is independent of the number of items  $n$ , and is thus applicable in settings with a very large number of candidate items. Even though our regret upper bound does not capture the dependency with respect to the assortment size parameter  $K$ , the maximum assortment size is typically small (i.e.,  $K = \mathcal{O}(1)$ ) in many real-world applications.

Theorem 3. Suppose Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold and we run DASP-MNL (Algorithm 2) with confidence width  $\alpha_{t}$  given in equation 12 and initialization length  $T_{0}$  given in equation 10. Then, the expected regret for a sufficiently large time horizon  $T$  is upper-bounded as

$$
\mathcal {R} _ {T} \leq C _ {1} \cdot d \sqrt {T \log T \log (T / d)}
$$

for some constant  $C_1$  independent of  $n$ ,  $d$  and  $T$ .

Proof. (Sketch) In proving our regret bounds, we first show that the fixed point  $B_{t}$  defined in Proposition 1 lies within  $[0, P_{0}]$  for some  $P_{0}$ , allowing us to constrain our search for the fixed point into a bounded interval. This result also implies that the optimum prices  $p_{ti}^{*}$  are bounded within  $[1, P]$  for some  $P$ . Then, we show that  $T_{0} = \Theta(d + \log T)$  rounds of random initialization is enough to ensure that  $\Theta(\sigma_{0}^{-2}(d + \log T + P^{2}))$  is invertible at the end of the initialization phase with high probability. Similar to Li et al. (2017) and Oh & Iyengar (2021), the independence assumption (Assumption 3) on the feature vectors  $\boldsymbol{x}_{ti}$  is only needed to ensure that  $V_{T_{0}}$  is invertible at the end of the initialization phase. We do not require this stochasticity assumption in the rest of the regret analysis. Therefore, after the random initialization period of the first  $T_{0}$  rounds, the context vectors  $\boldsymbol{x}_{ti}$  can even be chosen adversariably as long as their norms  $\| \boldsymbol{x}_{ti} \|$  are bounded and they satisfy the minimum price sensitivity condition  $\langle \phi^{*}, \boldsymbol{x}_{ti} \rangle \geq L_{0}$ .

In the next step, we show that the assortments  $S_{t}$  and prices  $\pmb{p}_{t}$  chosen at any round  $t$  give rise to a sufficiently large probability of selection for any item  $i \in S_{t}$  under any parameter  $\theta$  sufficiently close to  $\theta^{*}$ . This condition is central in showing that the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent and satisfies a finite-sample normality-type estimation error bound. Based on these error bounds, we construct optimistic utility estimate functions  $h_{ti}(p)$  that provide tight upper bounds for the true utility functions  $u_{ti}(p)$  with high probability. This result in turn implies that  $\widetilde{R}_t(S,\pmb {p})\geq R_t(S,\pmb {p})$  for any  $S\in S_K$  and any  $\pmb {p}\in \mathbb{R}_+^n$ . Finally, we decompose the regret into two parts where some suitable defined good event holds (with high probability) and it does not. We defer the additional details to Appendix B.

# 4.4 EXTENSION TO ONLINE PARAMETER UPDATE

Algorithm 2 is simple to implement and enjoys provable regret bounds as shown in Theorem 3. However, the computation of the MLE at each round of Algorithm 2 requires access to all feature vectors corresponding to previous assortments. To reduce both the time and space complexities of our algorithm and improve its efficiency, we can instead use an online parameter update rule. The online version presented as Algorithm 3 in Appendix C finds an approximate MLE solution only using the context vectors corresponding to the last assortment. To achieve this, we use the fact that the negative log-likelihood function is strongly convex after initialization and apply a variant of the online Newton step discussed in Hazan et al. (2014); Zhang et al. (2016); Oh & Iyengar (2021). We show that the modified algorithm still enjoys  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$  even with the online update.

Theorem 4. Suppose Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold and we run DASP-MNL with online parameter updates (Algorithm 3) with confidence width  $\alpha_{t}$  given in equation 18 and initialization length  $T_0$  given in equation 10. Then, the expected regret for a sufficiently large time horizon  $T$  is upper-bounded as

$$
\mathcal {R} _ {T} \leq C _ {2} \cdot d \sqrt {T \log T \log (T / d)}
$$

for some constant  $C_2$  independent of  $n$ ,  $d$  and  $T$ .

Proof. See Appendix C for the proof.

# 4.5 REGRET LOWER BOUNDS FOR ASSORTMENT SELECTION AND PRICING PROBLEM

In this section, we establish a regret lower bound of order  $\Omega(d\sqrt{T})$  in terms of key problem primitives  $n$ ,  $d$ , and  $T$  for the problem of assortment selection and pricing under the contextual MNL choice model. This result demonstrates that the proposed algorithm DASP-MNL (Algorithm 2) and its online version (Algorithm 3) are optimal, up to logarithmic terms in  $d$  and  $T$ .

Theorem 5. There exists a universal constant  $C_3$  such that for any maximum assortment size  $K \geq 1$ , any minimum price sensitivity  $L_0 > 0$ , any context dimension  $d$  divisible by 4, and any policy  $\pi$ , there exists a worst-case problem instance with  $n = \Theta(K \cdot 2^d)$  items, bounded context vectors (i.e.,  $\| \pmb{x}_{ti} \| \leq 1$  for all  $i \in [n]$ ), and bounded feature vectors (i.e.,  $\| (\pmb{\theta}^*; \pmb{\phi}^*) \| \leq 1$ ) such that the regret of  $\pi$  is lower bounded by  $C_3 \cdot d\sqrt{T} / L_0$ .

Proof. (Sketch) At a high level, we prove this theorem in three steps. In the first step, we construct an adversarial set of parameters and reduce the task of lower bounding the worst-case regret of any policy to lower bounding the Bayes risk over the constructed parameter set. In the second step, we use a counting argument similar to the one used in Chen & Wang (2018) and Chen et al. (2020) to provide an explicit lower bound on the Bayes risk of the constructed adversarial parameter set. Finally, we apply Pinsker's inequality to complete the proof. We defer the details of the proof to Appendix D.

# 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms: DASP-MNL presented in Algorithm 2 and its online version Algorithm 3. We numerically evaluate our algorithms over independently generated problem instances and provide our results in Figure 2. In each instance, we generate problem parameters  $(\psi^{*};\phi^{*})$  and context vectors  $x_{ti}$  by sampling their entries from uniform distributions such that we satisfy Assumptions 2 and 3. See Appendix E for further details. For various assortment sizes  $K$  and various numbers of feature dimensions  $d$ , we run 20 independent problem instances with  $n = 100$  items.

Figure 2: Cumulative regret of DASP-MNL (Algorithm 2), its online version (Algorithm 3), M3P (Javanmard et al., 2020), and DBL-MNL (Oh & Iyengar, 2021). The center lines show the mean across the runs while the error bars indicate two standard deviations. Results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in achieving diminishing regret per round as our theoretical results predict.

We compare the performances of our proposed algorithms with those of a state-of-the-art MNL assortment selection algorithm DBL-MNL (Oh & Iyengar, 2021) and an MNL pricing algorithm M3P (Javanmard et al., 2020). Since DBL-MNL is only designed for assortment selection in settings with fixed prices, we consider the price as a hyper-parameter and run the algorithm with the best selection of fixed pricing. On the other hand, M3P is designed to optimize prices under the assumption that all  $n$  items can be offered without any need for assortment selection. To account for the assortment size limitations of our experimental setting, we consider a version of this algorithm that only offers top  $K$  items (based on their estimated utility value) under the prices chosen by M3P. Figure 2 illustrates that our algorithms, which simultaneously address both assortment selection and pricing, outperform methods that concentrate solely on either assortment selection or pricing.
