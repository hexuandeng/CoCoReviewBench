# ABSTRACT

We investigate multi-task learning approaches which use a shared feature representation for all tasks. To better understand the transfer of task information, we study an architecture with a shared module for all tasks and a separate output module for each task. We study the theory of this setting on linear and ReLU-activated models. Our key observation is that whether or not tasks' data are well-aligned can significantly affect the performance of multi-task learning. We show that misalignment between task data can cause negative transfer (or hurt performance) and provide sufficient conditions for positive transfer. Inspired by the theoretical insights, we show that aligning tasks' embedding layers leads to performance gains for multi-task training and transfer learning on the GLUE benchmark and sentiment analysis tasks; for example, we obtain a  $2.35\%$  GLUE score average improvement on 5 GLUE tasks over  $\mathrm{BERT}_{\mathrm{LARGE}}$  using our alignment method. We also design an SVD-based task re-weighting scheme and show that it improves the robustness of multi-task training on a multi-label image dataset.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Multi-task learning has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning to obtain language (Devlin et al. (2018); Liu et al. (2019a;b)) and visual representations (Kokkinos (2017)) from large-scale data. By leveraging supervised data from related tasks, multi-task learning approaches reduce the expensive cost of curating the massive per-task training data sets needed by deep learning methods and provide a shared representation which is also more efficient for learning over multiple tasks. While in some cases, great improvements have been reported compared to single-task learning (McCann et al. (2018)), practitioners have also observed problematic outcomes, where the performances of certain tasks have decreased due to task interference (Alonso and Plank (2016); Bingel and Søgaard (2017)). Predicting when and for which tasks this occurs is a challenge exacerbated by the lack of analytic tools. In this work, we investigate key components to determine whether tasks interfere constructively or destructively from theoretical and empirical perspectives. Based on these insights, we develop methods to improve the effectiveness and robustness of multi-task training.

There has been a large body of algorithmic and theoretical studies for kernel-based multi-task learning, but less is known for neural networks. The conceptual message from the earlier work (Baxter (2000); Evgeniou and Pontil (2004); Micchelli and Pontil (2005); Xue et al. (2007)) show that multi-task learning is effective over "similar" tasks, where the notion of similarity is based on the single-task models (e.g. decision boundaries are close). The work on structural correspondence learning (Ando and Zhang (2005); Blitzer et al. (2006)) uses alternating minimization to learn a shared parameter and separate task parameters. Zhang and Yeung (2014) use a parameter vector for each task and learn task relationships via  $l_{2}$  regularization, which implicitly controls the capacity of the model. These results are difficult to apply to neural networks: it is unclear how to reason about neural networks whose feature space is given by layer-wise embeddings.

To determine whether two tasks interfere constructively or destructively, we investigate an architecture with a shared module for all tasks and a separate output module for each task (Ruder (2017)). See Figure 1 for an illustration. Whereas previous work has shown that model similarity is a major component, we find that task data similarity is also important to determine the type of interference. To illustrate the idea, we consider three tasks with the same number of data samples where task 2 and 3 have the same decision boundary but different data distributions (see Figure 2 for an illustration). We observe that training task 1 with task 2 or task 3 can either improve or hurt task 1's performance, depending on the amount of contributing data along the decision boundary! This

observation suggests the importance of comparing task data and motivates a more refined study of multi-task learning in a module-wise setting.

Motivated by the above observation, we study the theory of multi-task learning through the shared module in linear and ReLU-activated settings. Our theoretical contribution involves three components: the capacity of the shared module, task covariance, and the per-task weight of the training procedure. The capacity plays a fundamental role because, if the shared module's capacity is too large, there is no interference between tasks; if it is too small, there can be destructive interference. Then, we show how to determine interference by proposing a more fine-grained notion called task covariance which can be used to measure the alignment of task data. By varying task covariances, we observe both positive and negative transfers from one task to another! We then provide sufficient conditions which guarantee that one task can transfer positively to another task, provided with sufficiently many data points from the contributor task. Finally, we study how to assign per-task weights for settings where different tasks share the same data but have different labels.

Our theory leads to the design of two algorithms with practical interest. First, we propose to align the covariances of the task embedding layers and present empirical evaluations on well-known benchmarks and tasks. On 5 tasks from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al. (2018b)) trained with the  $\mathrm{BERT}_{\mathrm{LARGE}}$  model by Devlin et al. (2018), our method improves the result of  $\mathrm{BERT}_{\mathrm{LARGE}}$  by a  $2.35\%$  average GLUE score, which is the standard metric for the benchmark. Further, we show that our method is applicable to transfer learning settings; we observe up to  $2.5\%$  higher accuracy by transferring between six sentiment analysis tasks using the LSTM model of Lei et al. (2018). Second, we propose an SVD-based task re-weighting scheme to improve multi-task training for settings where different tasks have the same data but different labels. On the ChestX-ray14 image classification dataset, we compare our method to the unweighted scheme and observe an improvement of 5.6 AUC score in total. In conclusion, these evaluations confirm that our theoretical insights are applicable to a broad range of settings and applications.

# 2 THREE COMPONENTS OF MULTI-TASK LEARNING

We study multi-task learning (MTL) approaches which use a shared module for all tasks and a separate output module for each task on linear and ReLU-activated models. We ask: What are the key components to determine whether or not MTL is better than single-task learning (STL)? In response, our work identifies three components: model capacity, task covariance, and optimization scheme. After setting up the model, we briefly describe the role of model capacity. We then quantify task data similarity using the notion of task covariance, which comprises the bulk of the section. We finish by showing the implications of our results for choosing optimization schemes.

# 2.1 MODELING SETUP

We are given  $k$  tasks. Let  $m_{i}$  denote the number of data samples of task  $i$ . For task  $i$ , let  $X_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_{i} \times d}$  denote its covariates and let  $y_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_{i}}$  denote its labels, where  $d$  is the dimension of the data. We have assumed that all the tasks have the same input dimension  $d$ . This is not a restrictive assumption

and is typically satisfied, e.g. for word embeddings on BERT. We consider an MTL model with a shared module  $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$  and a separate output module  $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^r$  for task  $i$ , where  $r$  denotes the output dimension of  $B$ . See Figure 1 for the illustration. We define the objective of finding an MTL model as minimizing the following equation over  $B$  and the  $A_i$ 's:

$$
f \left(A _ {1}, A _ {2}, \dots , A _ {k}; B\right) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {k} L \left(g \left(X _ {i} B\right) A _ {i}, y _ {i}\right), \tag {1}
$$

where  $L$  is a loss function such as the squared loss. The activation function  $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$  is applied on every entry of  $X_{i}B$ . In equation 1, all data samples contribute equally. Because of the differences between tasks such as data size, it is natural to re-weight tasks during training:

$$
f \left(A _ {1}, A _ {2}, \dots , A _ {k}; B\right) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {k} \alpha_ {i} \cdot L \left(g \left(X _ {i} B\right) A _ {i}, y _ {i}\right), \tag {2}
$$

This setup is an abstraction of the hard parameter sharing architecture (Ruder (2017)). The shared module  $B$  provides a universal representation (e.g., an LSTM for encoding sentences) for all tasks. Each task-specific module  $A_{i}$  is optimized for its output. We focus on two models as follows.

The single-task linear model. The labels  $y$  of each task follow a linear model with parameter  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$ :  $y = X\theta + \varepsilon$ . Every entry of  $\varepsilon$  follows the normal distribution  $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$  with variance  $\sigma^2$ . The function  $g(XB) = XB$ . This is a well-studied setting for linear regression (Hastie et al. (2005)).

The single-task ReLU model. Denote by  $\mathrm{ReLU}(x) = \max (x,0)$  for any  $x\in \mathbb{R}$ . We will also consider a non-linear model where  $X\theta$  goes through the ReLU activation function with  $a\in \mathbb{R}$  and  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$ :  $y = a\cdot \mathrm{ReLU}(X\theta) + \varepsilon$ , which applies the ReLU activation on  $X\theta$  entrywise. The encoding function  $g(XB)$  then maps to  $\mathrm{ReLU}(XB)$ .

Positive vs. negative transfer. For a source task and a target task, we say the source task transfers positively to the target task, if training both through equation 1 improves over just training the target task (measured on its validation set). Negative transfer is the converse of positive transfer.

Problem statement. Our goal is to analyze the three components to determine positive vs. negative transfer between tasks: model capacity  $(r)$ , task covariances  $\left(\{X_{i}^{\top} X_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}\right)$  and the per-task weights  $\left(\{\alpha_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}\right)$ . We focus on regression tasks under the squared loss but we also provide synthetic experiments on classification tasks to validate our theory.

Notations. For a matrix  $X$ , its column span is the set of all linear combinations of the column vectors of  $X$ . Let  $X^{\dagger}$  denote its pseudoinverse. Given  $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ ,  $\cos(x, y)$  is equal to  $x^{\top}y / (\|x\| \cdot \|y\|)$ .

# 2.2 MODEL CAPACITY

We begin by revisiting the role of model capacity, i.e. the output dimension of  $B$  (denoted by  $r$ ). We show that as a rule of thumb,  $r$  should be smaller than the sum of capacities of the STL modules.

Example. Suppose we have  $k$  linear regression tasks using the squared loss, equation 1 becomes:

$$
f \left(A _ {1}, A _ {2}, \dots , A _ {k}; B\right) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {k} \| X _ {i} B A _ {i} - y _ {i} \| _ {F} ^ {2}. \tag {3}
$$

The optimal solution of equation 1 for each single-task is  $\theta_{i} = (X_{i}^{\top}X_{i})^{\dagger}X_{i}^{\top}y_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ . Hence the capacity of 1 suffices for each single-task model. In the following, we show that if  $r\geq k$ , then there is no transfer between any two tasks.

Proposition 1. Let  $r \geq k$ . There exists an optimum  $B^{\star}$  and  $\{A_i^\star\}_{i=1}^k$  of equation 3 where  $B^{\star} A_i^{\star} = \theta_i$ , for all  $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k$ .

To illustrate the idea, as long as  $B^{\star}$  contains  $\theta_{i}$  for all  $i$  in its column span, then we can find  $A_{i}^{\star}$  such that  $B^{\star}A_{i}^{\star} = \theta_{i}$ , which is an optimal solution for equation 3 with minimum error. But this means no transfer among any two tasks. This can hurt generalization if a task has limited data, in which case its STL solution overfits to the training data, whereas the MTL solution can leverage other tasks' data to improve generalization. We leave the proof of Proposition 1 to Appendix B.1.

Algorithmic consequence. The implication is that limiting the shared module's capacity is necessary to enforce information transfer. In practice, if the shared module is too small, then it interferes with task transfer. But if it is too large, then no transfer occurs. The ideal capacity depends on task data similarity (e.g. smaller for similar tasks), which leads to the question of how to quantify them.

![](images/e9d2707a127e29bd98496a96628dd951d16ea65d25b4bd0b8b97d2d6d75d0ffb.jpg)  
Figure 3: Positive vs. Negative transfer by varying the source task's # samples and covariance. See the example below for the definition of two different kinds of task covariances.

# 2.3 TASK COVARIANCE

To show how to quantify task data similarity, we illustrate with two regression tasks under the linear model without noise:  $y_{1} = X_{1}\theta_{1}$  and  $y_{2} = X_{2}\theta_{2}$ . By Section 2.2, it is necessary to limit the capacity of the shared module to enforce information transfer. Therefore, we consider the case of  $r = 1$ . Hence, the shared module  $B$  is now a  $d$ -dimensional vector, and  $A_{1}, A_{2}$  are both scalars.

A natural requirement of task similarity is for the STL models to be similar, i.e.  $|\cos(\theta_1, \theta_2)|$  to be large. To see this, the optimal STL model for task 1 is  $(X_1^\top X_1)^{-1} X_1^\top y_1 = \theta_1$ . Hence if  $|\cos(\theta_1, \theta_2)|$  is 1, then tasks 1 and 2 can share a model  $B \in \mathbb{R}^d$  which is either  $\theta_1$  or  $-\theta_1$ . The scalar  $A_1$  and  $A_2$  can then transform  $B$  to be equal to  $\theta_1$  and  $\theta_2$ .

Is this requirement sufficient? Recall that in equation 3, the task data  $X_{1}$  and  $X_{2}$  are both multiplied by  $B$ . If they are poorly "aligned" geometrically, the performance could suffer. How do we formalize the geometry between task alignment? In the following, we show that the covariance matrices of  $X_{1}$  and  $X_{2}$ , which we define to be  $X_{1}^{\top}X_{1}$  and  $X_{2}^{\top}X_{2}$ , captures the geometry. We fix  $|\cos(\theta_1, \theta_2)|$  to be close to 1 to examine the effects of task covariances. Concretely, equation 3 reduces to:

$$
\max  _ {B \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} h (B) = \left\langle \frac {X _ {1} B}{\| X _ {1} B \|}, y _ {1} \right\rangle^ {2} + \left\langle \frac {X _ {2} B}{\| X _ {2} B \|}, y _ {2} \right\rangle^ {2}, \tag {4}
$$

where we apply the first-order optimality condition on  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  and simplify the equation. Specifically, we focus on a scenario where task 1 is the source and task 2 is the target. Our goal is to determine when task 1 transfers to task 2 positively or negatively in MTL. This boils down to study the cosine value between the optimum of equation 4 and  $\theta_{2}$ .

Example. In Figure 3, we show that by varying task covariances, we can observe both positive and negative transfers. The conceptual message is the same as Figure 2; we describe the data generation process in more detail. We use 4 tasks and measure the type of transfer from the other tasks to task 1. This leads to three lines (equation 4 with task 1 as the target task and  $2/3/4$  as source tasks) on the Figure, where the  $x$ -axis is the number of data samples from the source task and the  $y$ -axis is the target task's differences of MSE measured on its validation set between MTL minus STL.

Data generation. We have  $|\cos(\theta_1, \theta_2)| \approx 1$  (say 0.96). For  $i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ , let  $R_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{m_i \times d}$  denote a random Gaussian matrix drawn from  $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ . Let  $S_1 \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, d\}$  be a set of  $d/10$  coordinates and  $S_2 \subseteq S_1^{\complement}$  be a set of  $d/10$  coordinates in the complement of  $S_1$ . For  $i = 1, 2$ , let  $D_i$  be a diagonal matrix whose entries are equal to a large value  $\kappa$  (e.g.  $\kappa = 100$ ) for coordinates in  $S_i$  and 1 otherwise. Let  $Q_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  denote an orthonormal matrix, i.e.  $Q_i^\top Q_i$  is equal to the identity matrix.

Then, we define the 4 tasks as follows. (i) Task 1:  $X_{1} = R_{1}Q_{1}D_{1}$  and  $y_{1} = X_{1}\theta_{1}$ . (ii) Task 2:  $X_{2} = R_{2}Q_{1}D_{1}$  and  $y_{2} = X_{2}\theta_{2}$ . (iii) Task 3:  $X_{3} = R_{3}Q_{1}D_{2}$  and  $y_{3} = X_{3}\theta_{2}$ . (iv) Task 4:  $X_{4} = R_{4}Q_{2}D_{1}$  and  $y_{4} = X_{4}\theta_{2}$ . Intuitively, task 1 and 2 have the same covariance but the signals of tasks 1 and 3/4 lie in different subspaces.

Analysis. Unless the source task has lots of samples to estimate  $\theta_{2}$ , which is much more than the samples needed to estimate only the coordinates of  $S_{1}$ , the effect of transferring to task 1 is small. In addition, we observe similar results for classification tasks and for ReLU-activated regression tasks.

# Algorithm 1 Covariance alignment for multi-task training

Require: Task embedding layers  $X_{1}\in \mathbb{R}^{m_{1}\times d}$ $X_{2}\in \mathbb{R}^{m_{2}\times d}$  ,...,  $X_{k}\in \mathbb{R}^{m_{k}\times d}$  , shared module  $B$

Parameter: Alignment matrices  $R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, R_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  and output modules  $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{k}$

1: Let  $Z_{i} = X_{i}R_{i}$ , for  $1\leq i\leq k$  
2: Let the input to the shared module  $B$  be  $Z_{i}$  instead of  $X_{i}$  
3: Fix  $B$ , minimize jointly over  $R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, R_{k}$  and the output layers  $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{k}$

Theory. Next we rigorously quantify how many data points is needed to guarantee positive transfer from task 1 to task 2. This is motivated by the folklore that when one task has a lot of data but a related task has limited data, then the task with more data can often transfer positively to the related task. Recall that  $m_{1}$  is the number of data points of task 1. The interesting question is what parameter dependence is needed on  $m_{1}$  to guarantee positive transfer. In the following, we show that the condition numbers of the tasks' covariance matrices provide an upper bound on  $m_{1}$ .

Theorem 2 (informal). For  $i = 1,2$ , let  $y_{i} = X_{i}\theta_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$  denote two linear regression tasks with parameters  $\theta_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{d}$  and  $m_{i}$  number of samples. Suppose that each row of the source task  $X_{1}$  is drawn independently from a distribution with covariance  $\Sigma_1\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$  and bounded  $l_{2}$ -norm. Assume that  $c = \kappa (X_2)\sin (\theta_1,\theta_2)\leq 1 / 3$ . Denote by  $(B^{\star},A_1^{\star},A_2^{\star})$  the optimal MTL solution. With high probability, when  $m_{1}$  is at least on the order of  $(\kappa^{2}(\Sigma_{1})\cdot \kappa^{4}(X_{2})\cdot \| y_{2}\|^{2}) / c^{4}$ , we have that

$$
\| B ^ {\star} A _ {2} ^ {\star} - \theta_ {2} \| / \| \theta_ {2} \| \leq 6 c + \frac {1}{1 - 3 c} \frac {\| \varepsilon_ {2} \|}{\| X _ {2} \theta_ {2} \|}.
$$

Recall that for a matrix  $X$ ,  $\kappa(X)$  denotes its condition number. Theorem 2 quantifies the trend in Figure 3, where the improvements for task 2 reaches the plateau when  $m_1$  becomes large enough.

The ReLU model. We show a similar result for the ReLU model, which requires resolving the challenge of analyzing the ReLU function. We use a geometric characterization for the ReLU function under distributional input assumptions by Du et al. (2017). We leave the formal statement, the proof of Theorem 2 and its extension to the ReLU setting to Appendix B.2.2 and B.2.3. $^3$

Algorithmic consequence. An implication of our theory is a covariance alignment method to improve multi-task training. For the  $i$ -th task, we add an alignment matrix  $R_{i}$  before its input  $X_{i}$  passes through the shared module  $B$ . Algorithm 1 shows the procedure.

We also propose a metric called covariance similarity score to measure the similarity between two tasks, which extends our theoretical insights for practical use. Given two matrices  $X_{1} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_{1} \times d}$  and  $X_{2} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_{2} \times d}$ , we measure their similarity in three steps: (a) The covariance matrix is  $X_{1}^{\top}X_{1}$ . (b) Find the best rank- $r_{1}$  approximation to be  $U_{1,r_{1}}D_{1,r_{1}}U_{1,r_{1}}^{\top}$ , where  $r_{1}$  is chosen to contain 99% of the singular values. (c) Apply step (a),(b) to  $X_{2}$ , compute the inner product:

$$
\text {C o v a r i a n c e} \quad \| (U _ {1, r _ {1}} D _ {1, r _ {1}} ^ {1 / 2}) ^ {\top} U _ {2, r _ {2}} D _ {2, r _ {2}} ^ {1 / 2} \| _ {F} \\ = \frac {\left\| (U _ {1 , r _ {1}} D _ {1 , r _ {1}} ^ {1 / 2}) ^ {\top} U _ {2 , r _ {2}} D _ {2 , r _ {2}} ^ {1 / 2} \right\| _ {F}}{\left\| U _ {1 , r _ {1}} D _ {1 , r _ {1}} ^ {1 / 2} \right\| _ {F} \cdot \left\| U _ {2 , r _ {2}} D _ {2 , r _ {2}} ^ {1 / 2} \right\| _ {F}}. \tag {5}
$$

The nice property of the score is that it is invariant to rotations of the columns of  $X_{1}$  and  $X_{2}$ .

# 2.4 OPTIMIZATION SCHEME

Lastly, we consider the effect of re-weighting the tasks (or their losses in equation 2). When does reweighting the tasks help? In this part, we show a use case for improving the robustness of multi-task training in the presence of label noise. The settings involving label noise can arise when some tasks only have weakly-supervised labels, which have been studied before in the literature (e.g. Mintz et al. (2009); Pentina and Lampert (2017)). We start by describing a motivating example.

Consider two tasks where task 1 is  $y_{1} = X\theta$  and task 2 is  $y_{2} = X\theta + \varepsilon_{2}$ . When we train the two tasks together, the error  $\varepsilon_{2}$  will add noise to the trained model. However, by up weighting task 1, we reduce the noise from task 2 and get better performance.

To rigorously study the effect of task weights, we consider a setting where all the tasks have the same data but different labels. This setting arises for example in multi-label image datasets.

We study the linear model to show how the re-weighted scheme can change the optimal solution.

Proposition 3. Let the capacity of the shared module be  $r \leq k$ . Given  $k$  linear regression tasks with the same covariates but different labels  $\{(X, y_i)\}_{i=1}^k$  where  $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$  has rank  $d$ , let  $X = UDV^\top$  denote its SVD. The column span of the optimal  $B^\star \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$  for the re-weighted loss is equal to the column span of  $(X^\top X)^{-1}VDQ_r$ , where  $Q_rQ_r^\top$  is the best rank- $r$  approximation to  $\sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i U^\top y_i y_i^\top U$ .

We can also extend Proposition 3 to show that all local minima of equation 3 are global minima in the linear setting. We leave the proof to Appendix B.3. Based on Proposition 3, we provide a rigorous proof of the previous example. Suppose that  $X$  is full rank,  $(X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}X[\alpha_{1}y_{1},\alpha_{1}y_{2}]) = [\alpha_{1}\theta ,\alpha_{2}\theta +\alpha_{2}(X^{\top}X)^{-1}X\varepsilon_{2}]$ . Hence, when we increase  $\alpha_{1}$ ,  $\cos (B^{\star},\theta)$  increases closer to 1.

Algorithmic consequence. A natural question then is how do we identify a re-weighted scheme in the presence of label noise. Below, we describe an algorithm based on the idea of SVD. Inspired by Proposition 3, we compute the per-task weights by computing the SVD over  $X^{\top}y_{i}$ , for  $1\leq i\leq k$ . The intuition is that if the label vector of a task  $y_{i}$  is noisy, then the entropy of  $y_{i}$  is small. Therefore, we would like to design a procedure that removes the noise. The SVD procedure does this, where the weight of a task is calculated by its projection into the principal  $r$  directions. See Algorithm 2 for the description.

# Algorithm 2 An SVD-based task reweighting scheme

Input:  $k$  tasks:  $(X,y_{i})\in (\mathbb{R}^{m\times d},\mathbb{R}^{m})$  ; a rank parameter  $r\in \{1,2,\dots ,k\}$

Output: A weight vector:  $\{\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\dots ,\alpha_{k}\}$

1: Let  $\theta_{i} = X^{\top}y_{i}$  
2:  $U_r, D_r, V_r = \mathrm{SVD}_r(\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_k)$ , i.e. the best rank- $r$  approximation to the  $\theta_i$ 's.  
3: Let  $\alpha_{i} = \| \theta_{i}^{!}U_{r}\|$ , for  $i = 1,2,\ldots ,k$

# 3 EXPERIMENTS

We describe connections between our theoretical results and practical problems of interest. We show three claims on real world datasets. (i) The shared MTL module is best performing when its capacity is smaller than the total capacities of the single-task models. (ii) Our proposed covariance alignment method improves multi-task training on a variety of settings including the GLUE benchmarks and six sentiment analysis tasks. Our method can be naturally extended to transfer learning settings and we validate this as well. (iii) Our SVD-based re-weighed scheme is more robust than the standard un-weighted scheme on multi-label image classification tasks in the presence of label noise.

# 3.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Datasets and models. We describe the datasets and models we use in the experiments.

GLUE: GLUE is a natural language understanding dataset including question answering, sentiment analysis, text similarity and textual entailment problems. We choose  $\mathrm{BERT}_{\mathrm{LARGE}}$  as our model, which is a 24 layer network from Devlin et al. (2018).

Sentiment Analysis: This dataset includes six tasks: movie review sentiment (MR), sentence subjectivity (SUBJ), customer reviews polarity (CR), question type (TREC), opinion polarity (MPQA), and the Stanford sentiment treebank (SST) tasks. For each task, the goal is to categorize sentiment opinions expressed in the text. We use an embedding layer followed by an LSTM layer proposed by Lei et al. (2018). For the word embeddings, we use GloVe.

ChestX-ray14: This dataset contains 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images and each image has up to 14 diseases. This is a 14-task multi-label image classification problem. We use the CheXNet model from Rajpurkar et al. (2017), which is a 121-layer convolutional neural network on all tasks.

For all models, we share the main module across all tasks (BERTLARGE for GLUE, LSTM for sentiment analysis, CheXNet for ChestX-ray14) and assign a separate regression or classification layer on top of the shared module for each tasks.

Comparison methods. For the experiment on multi-task training, we compare Algorithm 1 by training with our method and training without it. Specifically, we apply the alignment procedure on the task embedding layers. See Figure 4 for an illustration, where  $E_{i}$  denotes the embedding of task  $i$ ,  $R_{i}$  denotes its alignment module and  $Z_{i} = E_{i}R_{i}$  is the rotated embedding.

4We also tested with multi-layer perceptron and CNN. The results are similar (cf. Appendix C.5).

For the experiment on transfer learning, we first train an STL model on the source task by tuning its model capacity (e.g. the output dimension of the LSTM layer). Then, we fine-tune the STL model on the target task for 5-10 epochs. To apply Algorithm 1, we add an alignment module during the fine-tuning step to align the target task.

For the experiment on re-weighted schemes, we first compute the per-task weights as described in Algorithm 2. Then, we re-weight the loss function as in equation 2. We compare the performance of training with the re-weighted loss vs. with the un-weighted loss

Metric. We measure performance on the GLUE benchmark using a standard metric called the GLUE score, which contains accuracy and correlation scores for each task. For the sentiment analysis tasks, we measure the accuracy of predicting the sentiment opinion. For the image classification task, we measure the area under the curve (AUC) score. We run five different random seeds to report the average results. The result of an MTL experiment is averaged over the results of all the tasks.

# 3.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We present use cases of our methods on open-source datasets. We expected to see improvements via our methods in multi-task and other settings, and indeed we saw such gains across a variety of tasks.

Improving multi-task training. We apply Algorithm 1 on five tasks (CoLA, MRPC, QNLI, RTE, SST-2) from the GLUE benchmark using a state-of-the-art language model BERTLARGE. We compare the average performance over all five tasks and find that our method outperforms BERTLARGE by  $2.35\%$  average GLUE score for the five tasks. For the particular setting of training two tasks, our method outperforms BERTLARGE on 7 of the 10 task pairs. See Figure 5a for the results.

Improving transfer learning. While our study has focused on multi-task learning, transfer learning is a naturally related goal – and we find that our method is useful in this case as well. We validate this by training an LSTM on the sentiment analysis tasks. Figure 5b shows the result with SST being the source task and the rest being the target task. We see that Algorithm 1 improves the accuracy on four tasks by up to  $2.5\%$ .

Re-weighting training for the same task data. We evaluate Algorithm 2 on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. This setting satisfies the assumption of Algorithm 2, which requires different tasks to have the same input data. Across all 14 tasks, we find that our method improves training the unweighted loss by  $0.4\%$  AUC score, which is  $5.6\%$  score for all tasks.

# 3.3 ABLATION STUDIES

Model capacity. We verify our hypothesis that the capacity of the MTL model should not exceed the total capacities of the STL model. We show this on an LSTM module with the sentiment analysis tasks. Recall that the capacity of the LSTM module is its output dimension. First, we train an MTL model with all tasks and vary the shared module's capacity to find the optimal setting (from 5 to 500). Then, we train an STL model for each task and find the optimal setting similarly. In Figure 6, we find that the performance of MTL peaks when the shared module has capacity 100. This is

much smaller than the total capacities of all the STL models. The result confirms our intuition that by constraining the shared module's capacity in MTL, tasks interfere with each other.

Task covariance. We apply our metric of task covariance similarity score from Section 2.3 to provide an in-depth study of the covariance alignment method. The hypothesis is that: (a) aligning the covariances helps, which we have shown in Figure 5a; (b) the similarity score between two tasks increases after applying the alignment. We verify the hypothesis on the sentiment analysis tasks. We use the single-task model's embedding before the LSTM layer to compute the covariance.

First, we measure the similarity score using equation 5 between all six single-task models. Then, for each task pair, we train an MTL model using Algorithm 1. We measure the similarity score on the trained MTL model. Our results confirm the hypothesis (Figure 7): (a) we observe increased accuracy on 13 of 15 task pairs by up to  $4.1\%$ ; (b) the similarity score increases for all 15 task pairs.

**Optimization scheme.** We verify the robustness of Algorithm 2. After selecting two tasks from the ChestX-ray14 dataset, we test our method by assigning random labels to  $20\%$  of the data on one task. On 20 randomly selected pairs, our method improves over the unweighted scheme by an average  $2.4\%$  AUC score. See Appendix C.5 for more details on the setup.

# 4 RELATED WORK

There has been a large body of recent work on using the multi-task learning approach to train deep neural networks. Liu et al. (2019a); McCann et al. (2018) and subsequent follow-up work get state-of-the-art results on the GLUE benchmark, which inspired our study of an abstraction of the MTL model. Recent work of Zamir et al. (2018); Standley et al. (2019) answer which visual tasks to train together via a heuristic which involves intensive computation.

Of particular relevance to this work are those that study the theory of multi-task learning. The earlier works of Baxter (2000); Ben-David and Schuller (2003) are among the first to formally study the importance of task relatedness for learning multiple tasks. See also the follow-up work of Maurer (2006) which studies generalization bounds of MTL. A closely related line of work to structural learning is subspace selection, i.e. how to select a common subspace for multiple tasks. Examples from this line work include Obozinski et al. (2010); Wang et al. (2015); Fernando et al. (2013). Evgeniou and Pontil (2004); Micchelli and Pontil (2005) study a formulation that extends support vector machine to the multi-task setting. See also Argyriou et al. (2008); Pentina and Ben-David (2015) that provide more refined optimization methods and further study. The work of Ben-David et al. (2010) provides theories to measure the differences between source and target tasks for transfer learning in a different model setup. Recent work of Zhang et al. (2019) shows adversarially robust methods for domain adaptation.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

In this work, we studied the theory of multi-task learning in linear and ReLU-activated settings. We verified our theory and its practical implications through extensive synthetic and real world experiments. Our work opens up many interesting future questions. First, could we provide a better generalization theory to guide data selection for multi-task learning? Second, a limitation of our SVD-based optimization scheduler is that it only applies to settings with the same data. Could we extend the method for heterogeneous task data? More broadly, we hope our work inspires further studies to better understand multi-task learning in neural networks and to guide its practice.
