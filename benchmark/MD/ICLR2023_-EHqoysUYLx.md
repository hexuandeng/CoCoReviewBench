# ABSTRACT

In federated learning, the underlying data distributions may be different across clients. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of generalization error of federated learning, which captures both heterogeneity and relatedness of the distributions. In particular, we assume that the heterogeneous distributions are sampled from a meta-distribution. In this two-level distribution framework, we characterize the generalization error not only for clients participating in the training but also for unparticipating clients. We first show that the generalization error for unparticipating clients can be bounded by participating generalization error and participating gap caused by clients' sampling. We further establish fast learning bounds of order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{mn} +\frac{1}{m}\right)$  for unparticipating clients, where  $m$  is the number of clients and  $n$  is the sample size at each client. To our knowledge, the obtained fast bounds are state-of-the-art in the two-level distribution framework. Moreover, previous theoretical results mostly require the loss function to be bounded. We derive convergence bounds of order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mn}} +\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\right)$  under unbounded assumptions, including sub-exponential and sub-Weibull losses.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In federated learning, a common model is trained based on the collaboration of the participating clients holding local data samples (McMahan et al., 2017). Typically, the underlying distributions vary across clients since the data-generating processes are affected by the local environment. Federated learning is heterogeneous in the scenario where local distributions are different (Wang et al., 2021). Most existing experimental and theoretical results focus on the convergence of optimization on training datasets (Li et al., 2020b; Karimireddy et al., 2020; Mitra et al., 2021; Mishchenko et al., 2022; Yun et al., 2022). The generalization error, which is more natural and important in machine learning, seems not to have been carefully examined in heterogeneous federated learning.

As a key performance indicator of the machine learning model, generalization error measures the performance of a trained model by its population risk with the corresponding distribution. However, existing generalization results are generally derived for clients participating in the training, which only captures the performance of the learned model on seen distributions during training (Mohri et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021; Masiha et al., 2021).

In practice, the probability that a client participates in the federated training is affected by many factors such as the reliability of network connections or the availability of the client. The realistic participation ratio may be slow and a variety of clients never have a chance to participate during the training process (Kairouz et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020a; Yuan et al., 2021). Though the training process is operated only on participating clients, the trained model will be used by both unparticipating and participating clients. Since the data distributions of unparticipating clients are different from that of participating clients, it is natural and emergent to ask the following question:

# Would the unparticipating clients benefit from the model trained by participating clients?

To answer this question theoretically, we take the participation gap into account in the analysis of generalization error, which is generally ignored by existing works.

In addition to the ignored participating gap, existing theoretical results on the generalization error of heterogeneous federated learning have two more limitations to our knowledge. First, all previous learning rates in probability form are of the order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mn}}\right)$ , where  $m$  is the number of clients and  $n$  is the sample size at each client (Mohri et al., 2019). We note that faster rates of order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{mn}\right)$  are derived in (Chen et al., 2021). However, their learning rates are in expectation form. Faster learning rates in probability form haven't been derived even only for participating clients. The guarantees in-expectation form reflect the average performance of the model trained based on the randomly sampled datasets. The theoretical bounds in probability form, which we focus on in this paper, reflect the performance of a single sampling on datasets (Klochkov & Zhivotovsky, 2021; Kanade et al., 2022; Sefidgaran et al., 2022a). Second, most previous generalization bounds are derived by assuming that the loss function is bounded. However, there are a variety of learning problems that do not satisfy this assumption. This includes regression problems where unbounded noise is added to labels (Kuchibhotla & Patra, 2022; Kuchibhotla & Chakraborty, 2018; Zhang & Zhou, 2018), clustering tasks with heavy-tailed distribution (Paul et al., 2021; Vellal et al., 2022), domain adaptation, and so on. Notable exception works in this direction include (Barnes et al., 2022) and (Sefidgaran et al., 2022b). However, their results are established under the assumption that local clients are homogeneous, which is highly restrictive in the general federated scenario.

In this paper, we assume that data distributions of participating and unparticipating clients are drawn from a meta-distribution  $P$ . We argue that this assumption is reasonable in practice. For instance, in cross-device federated learning, the number of total clients is generally large and it is natural to assume that there exists a meta-distribution (Reisizadeh et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). In this learning scenario, we assume that the total number of clients is  $M$ . Among all these  $M$  clients, only  $m$  clients have a chance to participate in the training phase, which means that the training process only involves the  $m$  distributions  $\{D_i\}_{i=1}^m$ . Note that the total number  $M$  and the number of unparticipating clients/distributions is generally larger than  $m$  (Hu et al., 2022; Xu & Wang, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Practically, the model is trained based on datasets  $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^m$ , where  $S_i$  is the dataset located in client  $i$  and is sampled from  $D_i$ . This two-level framework not only captures the heterogeneity of clients' distributions but also reflects the relatedness of the distributions. Thanks to this framework, we are allowed to characterize the generalization performance of both participating distributions and unparticipating distributions. A similar framework has been used by several recent literature (Yuan et al., 2021; Reisizadeh et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). However, these works mainly focus on the optimization performance or only involve experimental results on the generalization. The objective of this work is to provide theoretical results on generalization error in this framework. Our contributions are summarized as follows.

- We provide a systematic analysis of the generalization error of federated learning in the two-level framework, which captures the missed participating gap in the existing works. This two-level framework captures both heterogeneity and relatedness of clients' distributions. Moreover, all learning bounds presented in this paper are in probability form instead of expectation form.  
- We derive fast learning rates in the empirical risk minimization setting. The unparticipating error is bounded by two terms. One is participating error. The other is the participation gap results from missing clients in the training. Our participating bounds and unparticipating bounds are of order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{mn}\right)$  and  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{mn} +\frac{1}{m}\right)$ , respectively.  
- We study the learning bounds for unbounded loss functions, including sub-gaussian, subexponential, and heavy-tailed losses. Small-ball methods and concentration inequalities for unbounded random variables are used in the unbounded setting. Our bounds are comparable with the existing results with bounded assumptions.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the two-level distribution framework and provide basic theoretical results in this framework. In Section 3, we derive fast generalization bounds. In Section 4, we go beyond the bounded assumption and provide the generalization bounds for unbounded losses such as sub-exponential and sub-Weibull losses. In Section 5, we discuss related work in the directly of generalization analysis of heterogeneous federated learning. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6. All proofs are postponed to the appendix.

# 2 TWO-LEVEL DISTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK

Let  $\mathcal{X}$  denote the input space and  $\mathcal{Y}$  the output space. For simplicity, we denote  $Z = (X,Y)$  the random variable with support  $\mathcal{Z} = \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}$ . Let  $\mathcal{D}$  denote the set of all probability distributions on  $\mathcal{Z}$  and  $P$  is a meta-distribution on  $\mathcal{D}$ . The assumption of meta-distribution is reasonable especially in cross-device federated learning scenario, where the local devices may be a large population of mobile phones. As shown in Figure 1, in this two-level distribution framework, we assume the total number of clients is  $M$  (may be infinity) and the number of clients participating in training is  $m$ . It is worth emphasizing that  $M$  is generally larger than  $m$  owing to unreliable network connections. We denote by  $D_{i}$  the distribution associated to client  $i$  and assume  $\{D_1,\dots ,D_m\}$  are independently sampled from  $\mathcal{D}$  according to  $P$ . Data sample  $S_{i} = \{Z_{i}^{j}\}_{j = 1}^{n}$  located on participating client  $i$  is made of  $n$  i.i.d realizations of  $Z$  following  $D_{i}$ . The global model is trained based on  $\{S_i\}_{i = 1}^m$  and will be used by all  $M$  clients. Two-level distribution framework allows us to measure the performance of the global model with respect to clients' distribution  $P$ , which quantifies both the participation gap (caused by client sampling) and participating error (caused by data sampling from participating distributions).

Let the hypothesis space  $\mathcal{H}$  be a family of real-valued functions defined on  $\mathcal{X}$ . The loss function  $\ell: \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}^+$  is a non-negative function. We denote the population risk  $\mathcal{L}_P(h)$  by  $\mathcal{L}_P(h) = \mathbb{E}_{D_i \sim P}[\mathbb{E}_{Z \sim D_i}[\ell(h(X), Y)]]$ , where  $h \in \mathcal{H}$  represents the global hypothesis shared by all local clients. The population risk minimizer  $h^*$  associated to population risk  $\mathcal{L}_P(h)$  is defined as  $h^* = \arg \min_{h \in \mathcal{H}}\mathcal{L}_P(h)$ . However, it is impossible to minimize  $\mathcal{L}_P(h)$  directly because the exact meta distribution and client local distributions are unknown to us. We have access to only a finite number of clients and finite training data at each client. The global objective function defined as population risk is often optimized by the form of empirical risk minimization (ERM) objective function defined as:  $\mathcal{L}_S(h) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\ell(h(X_i^j), Y_i^j)$ , where  $(X_i^j, Y_i^j)$  represents the  $j$ -th training data point at  $i$ -th participating client. For simplicity, we denote  $Z_i^j = (X_i^j, Y_i^j)$  the data point. Let  $S_i = \{Z_i^j\}_{j=1}^n$  denotes the local training set at  $i$ -th participating client and  $S = S_i \cup \dots \cup S_m$  represent the global training set across all participating clients. The empirical risk minimizer  $\widehat{h}$  condition on dataset  $S$  is defined as  $\widehat{h} = \arg \min_{h \in \mathcal{H}}\mathcal{L}_S(h)$ . To analyze the generalization in our two-level framework, we further define semi-empirical distribution  $D$  and the corresponding semi-empirical risk  $\mathcal{L}_D(h)$  by  $D = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}D_i$  and  $\mathcal{L}_D(h) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\mathbb{E}_{Z \sim D_i}[\ell(h, z)]$ . We extend the previous definitions and denote by  $\widehat{h}^*$  the semi-empirical risk minimizer  $\widehat{h}^* = \arg \min_{h \in \mathcal{H}}\mathcal{L}_D(h)$ .

The semi-excess risk for participating clients is defined as:  $\mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}^*)$ . Semi-excess risk indicates the performance of the learned model  $\widehat{h}$  on the unseen data associated with semi-empirical distribution  $D$ . The excess risk for unparticipating clients is defined as:  $\mathcal{L}_P(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_P(h^*)$ . Excess risk indicates the performance of the learned model  $\widehat{h}$  on the unseen clients distributed according to  $P$ . Note that the excess risk  $\mathcal{L}_P(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_P(h^*)$  is defined across two-level distribution framework. It will be shown that, in our analysis, all upper bound of excess risk  $\mathcal{L}_P(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_P(h^*)$  involves semi-excess risk  $\mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}^*)$  or its upper bound. To understand this framework better, we present our basic results of excess risk as follows:

Theorem 1 (Generalization error for unparticipating clients). For the VC major class $^1$ $\mathcal{F}$  with VC dimension  $d$ . If the loss function  $\ell$  is bounded by  $b$ , it follows that with probability at least  $1 - 2\delta$ ,

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {P} (\widehat {h}) - \mathcal {L} _ {P} (h ^ {*}) \leq c _ {1} b \sqrt {\frac {d}{m n}} + b \sqrt {\frac {\ln (1 / \delta)}{2 m n}} + c _ {2} b \sqrt {\frac {d}{m}} + b \sqrt {\frac {\ln (1 / \delta)}{2 m}},
$$

where  $c_{1}$  and  $c_{2}$  are constants.

Remark 1. Assume the total number of clients is  $M$  and  $P$  is a concrete meta-distribution on  $M$  different clients' distributions. The global model  $\widehat{h}$  is trained based on  $m$  participating clients. The excess risk measures the average performance of  $\widehat{h}$  on total  $M$  clients, which include participating and unparticipating clients. Theorem 1 indicates that, increasing the number of participating clients  $m$  leads to the decrease of excess risk  $\mathcal{L}_P(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_P(h^*)$ . In cross-device federated learning, the number of participating clients  $m$  may be large enough such that the excess risk approaches zero. Based on these discussions, we can give a positive answer to the question asked in Introduction. This is, from the perspective of average performance, unparticipating clients would benefit from the model trained by participating clients.

Remark 2. Theorem 1 is established by combining the upper bounds of participating error and participation gap. In particular, the terms of order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mn}}\right)$  correspond to participating generalization error. The remain terms of order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\right)$  correspond to participation gap. We point out that, in addition to VC major class (van der Vaart & Wellner, 1996), our proof framework can be applied to many interesting function classes with uniformly entropy number (Lei et al., 2016; Mendelson, 2003).

# 3 FAST LEARNING RATES IN TWO-LEVEL DISTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK

In this section, we present fast learning rates in our two-level distribution framework. Recall that  $\widehat{h}$  is the empirical risk minimizer and  $h^*$  is the population risk minimizer. Our goal is to bound the semi-excess risk for participating clients  $\mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}^*)$  and excess risk for unparticipating clients  $\mathcal{L}_P(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_P(h^*)$ . To get faster learning rates in our two-level distribution framework, we start by making some assumptions on loss function  $\ell$ , hypothesis space  $\mathcal{H}$ , semi-empirical distribution  $D$ , and meta distribution  $P$ .

Assumption 1. Loss function  $\ell$  is  $L$ -Lipschitz in its first argument:  $|\ell(y_1, y) - \ell(y_2, y)| \leq L|y_1 - y_2|$ .

Definition 1 (Bernstein condition). Let  $\mu$  be a distribution supported on  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$  and let  $\ell$  be a loss function with domain  $\mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{Y}$ . The tuple  $(\mu, \ell, \mathcal{H}, h^*)$  satisfies the  $(\beta, B)$ -Bernstein condition with parameter  $B > 0$  if the following holds for any  $h \in \mathcal{H}$ :

$$
\mathbb {E} \left(h (X) - h ^ {*} (X)\right) ^ {2} \leq B \mathbb {E} \left[ \ell \left(h (X), Y\right) - \ell \left(h ^ {*} (X), Y\right) \right] ^ {\beta}.
$$

Assumption 2. Theoretical analyses in our two-level distribution framework involve different types of Bernstein conditions:

(a) The tuple  $(D,\ell ,\mathcal{H},\widehat{h}^{*})$  satisfies the Bernstein condition with parameter  $B^{\prime}\geq 1,0 < \beta^{\prime}\leq$  1. That is, for any  $h\in \mathcal{H}$ $\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\mathbb{E}[h(X_i^1) - \widehat{h}^* (X_i^1)]^2\leq B'(\mathcal{L}_D(h) - \mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}^*))^\beta .$  
(b) The tuple  $(P,\ell ,\mathcal{H},h^{*})$  satisfies the Bernstein condition with parameter  $B^{\prime \prime}\geq 1,0 < \beta^{\prime \prime}\leq$  1. That is, for any  $h\in \mathcal{H}$ $\mathbb{E}_{D_i\sim P}[\mathbb{E}_{X\sim D_i}[h(X) - h^* (X)]^2 ]\leq B''(\mathcal{L}_P(h) - \mathcal{L}_P(h^*))^{\beta ''}.$

It is well known that fast learning rates require extra assumptions. Bernstein condition is widely used to get fast learning rates in the learning theory community (Xu & Zeevi, 2020; van Erven et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2022). We emphasize that it is not too restrictive. For example, it is directly implied by the boundedness property of functions with any probability distribution (Bartlett et al., 2004). Moreover, regression problems with strictly convex loss function satisfy the Bernstein condition if the function class is convex (Lecué & Mendelson, 2013). Other examples include excess risk functions with minimizer of population risk when the loss function is strongly convex and Lipschitz (Klochkov &

Zhivotovskiy, 2021). For our purposes, we need to check that both (a) and (b) in Assumption 2 hold. A typical example satisfying Assumption 2 is quadratic loss with convex function class  $\mathcal{H}$ . We provide some examples satisfying Assumption 2 in appendix. For more details, we refer to (Xu & Zeevi, 2020; Wu et al., 2022; van Erven et al., 2015).

Assumption 3 (Uniformly entropy number $^2$ ). Let  $\mathcal{H}$  be a family of bounded functions with uniformly entropy number  $\log \mathcal{N}(\epsilon, \mathcal{H}, \| \cdot \|_2)$ . Assume that there exist positive numbers  $\gamma, d$  and  $p$  such that  $\log \mathcal{N}(\epsilon, \mathcal{H}, \| \cdot \|_2) \leq d \log^p (\gamma / \epsilon)$  for any  $0 < \epsilon \leq \gamma$ .

Assumption 3 is a mild assumption if the function classes are bounded. We list some popular function classes satisfying Assumption 3: (a) If the VC-dimension of  $\mathcal{H}$  is finite, then  $\mathcal{H}$  satisfies assumption 3. For instance, the function class of  $k$ -means methods has finite VC dimension. For more details, we refer the reader to (Devroye et al., 2013). (b) When we set  $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ , then all the unit Euclidean ball  $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$  satisfy assumption 3. (c) If  $\mathcal{H}$  is a RKHS with kernel  $k$  and the rank of  $k$  is  $d$ , then  $\mathcal{H}$  satisfies Assumption 3.

# 3.1 FAST LEARNING RATES FOR PARTICIPATING CLIENTS

In this subsection, we provide fast learning rates for participating clients in high probability. To obtain faster convergence rates, we focus on semi-excess risk. Let  $\widehat{\mathcal{F}}^{*} := \{f : (X,Y) \mapsto \ell(h(X),Y) - \ell(\widehat{h}^{*}(X),Y), h \in \mathcal{H}\}$ , where  $\widehat{h}^{*}$  is the semi-empirical risk minimizer. We denote  $\mathcal{R}_{mn}(\widehat{\mathcal{F}}^{*},r)$  by the local empirical Rademacher complexity associated with semi-empirical distribution  $D$ :  $\mathcal{R}_{mn}(\widehat{\mathcal{F}}^{*},r) = \mathbb{E}_{S,\sigma}[\frac{1}{mn}\sup_{V(f) \leq r}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\sigma_{i}^{j}f(Z_{i}^{j})]$ , where  $V(f) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\mathbb{E}_{Z \sim D_{i}}[f(Z)]^{2}$ .

Theorem 2 (Semi-excess risk for participating clients). Let  $\mathcal{F}$  be a family of functions bounded by  $b$ . Under assumptions 1, 3 and (a) of Assumption 2, when  $mn \geq cd\log^p(mn)$ , it follows that with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ ,

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {D} (\widehat {h}) - \mathcal {L} _ {D} (\widehat {h} ^ {*}) \leq c _ {1} \left(\frac {\log^ {p} (m n)}{m n}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2 - \beta^ {\prime}}} + c _ {2} \left(\frac {\log (1 / \delta)}{m n}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2 - \beta^ {\prime}}},
$$

where  $c_{1}$  and  $c_{2}$  are constants depending on  $\gamma, p, L, \beta'$  and  $B_{1}, b, \beta'$  respectively.

Remark 3. Theorem 2 shows that the convergence rate of semi-empirical excess risk ranges from  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mn}}\right)$  to faster order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{mn}\right)$ , which corresponds to  $\beta' = 0$  and  $\beta' = 1$ , respectively. It indicates that, under Bernstein condition, the semi-empirical excess risk converges faster when we increase number of clients  $m$  or the size  $n$  of local dataset. We emphasize that our bounds in Theorem 2 is in high probability form, which is more emergent and challenging, when compared to the previous results in expectation form (Chen et al., 2021; Fallah et al., 2021). The learning bounds in Theorem 2 are conducted for the empirical risk minimizer  $\widehat{h}$ . For the inexact minimizer of  $\widehat{h}$ , the proof technique and the final bounds only involve an extra optimization term. For more details about the approximation error, we refer to (Wang et al., 2021; Su et al., 2021; Khaled et al., 2019).

# 3.2 FAST LEARNING RATES FOR UNPARTICIPATING CLIENTS

In this subsection we provide fast learning rates for unparticipating clients in high probability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result derived for unparticipating clients in heterogeneous federated learning. To develop theoretical guarantees in our two-level framework, we extend the previous local Rademacher complexity as follows. Let  $\mathcal{F}^* := \{f : (X,Y) \mapsto \ell(h(X),Y) - \ell(h^*(X),Y), h \in \mathcal{H}\}$ , where  $h^*$  is the population risk minimizer. We denote  $\mathcal{R}_m(\mathcal{F}^*,r)$  by the local Rademacher complexity associated with meta-distribution  $P$ :  $\mathcal{R}_m(\mathcal{F}^*,r) = \mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}_{\sigma}[\sup_{T(f) \leq r} \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sigma_i f(X_i,Y_i)]\right]$ , where  $T(f) = \mathbb{E}_{D_i \sim P} \mathbb{E}_{Z_i \sim D_i} [f(X_i)]^2$ .

Theorem 3 (Excess risk for unparticipating clients). Let  $\mathcal{F}$  be a family of functions taking values in  $[0, b]$ . Let  $B_2 \coloneqq \max(B''L^2, 1)$ . Let  $\varphi_m(r)$  be a sub-root function with fixed point  $r_m^*$  and assume  $\varphi_m(r)$  satisfies, for any  $r \geq r_m^*$ ,  $\varphi_m(r) \geq B_2\mathcal{R}_m(\mathcal{F}^*, r)$ . Then, under assumptions 1 and (b) of

Assumption 2, for any  $\delta >0,\alpha >0$  , with probability at least  $1 - \delta$  , we have

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {P} (\widehat {h}) - \mathcal {L} _ {P} (h ^ {*}) \leq c _ {0} (\mathcal {L} _ {D} (\widehat {h}) - \mathcal {L} _ {D} (\widehat {h} ^ {*})) + c _ {1} \max ((r _ {m} ^ {*}) ^ {\frac {1}{2 - \beta^ {\prime \prime}}}, (r _ {m} ^ {*}) ^ {\frac {1}{\beta^ {\prime \prime}}}) + \left(\frac {c _ {2} \log (\frac {1}{\delta})}{m}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2 - \beta^ {\prime \prime}}} + \frac {c _ {3} \log (\frac {1}{\delta})}{m},
$$

where  $c_{0} = \frac{K}{K - \beta^{\prime\prime}}$ ,  $c_{1} = (2K)^{\frac{\beta^{\prime\prime}}{2 - \beta^{\prime\prime}}}$  ( $10(1 + \alpha)$ ) $\frac{2}{2 - \beta^{\prime\prime}}$ ,  $c_{2} = 2^{\beta^{\prime\prime} + 1}B_{2}^{2}K^{\beta^{\prime\prime}}$ ,  $c_{3} = \frac{2b(1/3 + 1/\alpha)}{(2 - \beta^{\prime\prime})}$ .

Remark 4. Theorem 3 is developed across the two-level distribution framework, which brings extra challenges to the analysis. It is shown that the upper bound derived in 3 include semi-empirical excess risk term  $\mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}^*)$ , which is an outcome of excess risk decomposition across two-level framework. The second term in the upper bound involves the fixed point  $r_m^*$  of sub-root function. As pointed by (Mendelson, 2002), it is non-trivial to construct a computational sub-root function. In the following, we tackle this challenge using the tool of uniformly entropy number.

Theorem 4. Let  $\mathcal{F}$  be a family of functions bounded by  $b$ . Under assumptions 1, 3 and (b) of Assumption 2, when  $m \geq cd\log^p(m)$ , for any  $\delta > 0$ , it follows that with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ ,

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {P} (\widehat {h}) - \mathcal {L} _ {P} (h ^ {*}) \leq c _ {0} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {D} (\widehat {h}) - \mathcal {L} _ {D} (\widehat {h} ^ {*})\right) + c _ {1} \left(\frac {\log^ {p} m}{m}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2 - \beta^ {\prime \prime}}} + c _ {2} \left(\frac {\log (1 / \delta)}{m}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2 - \beta^ {\prime \prime}}},
$$

where  $c_{0} = \frac{K}{K - \beta^{\prime\prime}}$ ,  $c_{1}$  and  $c_{2}$  are constants depending on  $\gamma, p, L, \beta^{\prime\prime}$  and  $B_{2}, b, \beta^{\prime\prime}$  respectively.

Remark 5. The first term in Theorem 4 is semi-empirical excess risk term  $\mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_D(\widehat{h}^*)$ , whose upper bound has been derived in Theorem 2. Recall that  $\beta'$  and  $\beta''$  are constants defined in Assumption 2. In the cases where  $\beta' = 1$  and  $\beta'' = 1$ , it can be shown that excess risk is of order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{mn} + \frac{1}{m}\right)$  with high probability. To present Theorem 4, we must construct a sub-root function that links the expected local Rademacher complexity associated with meta-distribution  $P$  and uniformly entropy number. However, the conventional Dudley's integral bounds are built under empirical constraints (Boucheron et al., 2013). We tackle this challenge by extending the techniques developed in (Lei et al., 2016) to our two-level distribution framework.

# 4 LEARNING RATES FOR SUB-WEIBULL LOSSES

In this section, we provide generalization error bounds for unbounded losses in two-level distribution framework. In particular, we focus on loss functions satisfying sub-Weibull condition.

Definition 2 (Sub-Weibull random variables). A random variable  $X$  is said to be sub-Weibull if there is constant  $\| X\|_{\psi_\alpha} < \infty$ , such that  $\mathbb{P}(|X|\geq t)\leq 2\exp (-t^{\alpha} / \| X\|_{\psi_\alpha}^{\alpha})$ , for all  $t\geq 0$ . Sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential random variables are two special cases of Sub-Weibull random variables, which corresponds to  $\alpha = 2$  and  $\alpha = 1$ , respectively.

The learning rates derived in two-level framework for sub-exponential losses are deferred to the appendices. In the following we use small-ball method to establish learning rates for more heavily-tailed losses, where two-side concentration inequalities may fail to hold.

This subsection aims at establishing generalization bounds for unbounded losses that have heavier tails than sub-exponential distribution. Since the two side inequalities for empirical process fail to hold when the losses are heavy-tailed, the analysis of heavy-tailed losses require new method to relate empirical risk and population risk. In this subsection, we establish generalization bounds for heterogeneous federated learning by extending the small-ball method from i.i.d setting to our two-level distribution framework. We consider the quadratic loss function in this section. The extension to general losses can be achieved by using the techniques presented in (Mendelson, 2018).

In what follows, we denote by  $\| h \|_{L_2(\mu)}$  for Banach spaces  $L_2(\mathcal{X}, \mu)$ . Recall that  $D$  is the semi-empirical distribution and  $P$  is a meta-distribution. In particular, we have  $\| h \|_{L_2(D)} = \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \mathbb{E}_{X \sim D_i} [h(X)]^2 \right)^{1/2}$  and  $\| h \|_{L_2(P)} = (\mathbb{E}_{D_i \sim P} \mathbb{E}_{X \sim D_i} [h(X)]^2)^{1/2}$ . For the sake of clear exposition, we first introduce the small-ball condition.

Assumption 4 (Small-ball condition). Let  $\mathcal{H} \subset L_2(D)$  be a closed and convex class of functions and  $\mathcal{H} - \mathcal{H} \coloneqq \{h - h': h, h' \in \mathcal{H}\}$ .

(a) There is a  $\tau \geq 0$  for which  $Q_{\mathcal{H} - \mathcal{H}}(\tau) > 0$ , where  $Q_{\mathcal{H}}(\tau) = \inf_{h\in \mathcal{H}}\mathbb{P}(|h|\geq \tau \| h\|_{L_2(D)})$ .

(b) Let  $Q_{\mathcal{H}}(\tau, P) = \inf_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \mathbb{P}\left(|\mathbb{E}_{X \sim D_i}[h(X)]| \geq \tau \| h \|_{L_2(P)}\right)$ , where  $D_i$  represent local distribution at  $i$ -th participating client. There is a  $\tau \geq 0$  for which  $Q_{\mathcal{H} - \mathcal{H}}(\tau, P) > 0$ .

Assumption 4, small-ball condition, has been assumed for i.i.d and dependent data-generating process. To obtain high-probability theoretical guarantees, concentration techniques are widely used in the analysis of generalization error (Boucheron et al., 2013). Intuitively, empirical risk will concentrate around population risk with high probability only when the loss function has well-behaved moments. However, this condition may fail to hold for heavy-tailed losses (Mendelson, 2015). Assumption 4 appears first in the work of (Mendelson, 2015). Losses with any sort of moment equivalence satisfy small-ball condition, which is weaker than concentration condition and can be used to model heavy-tailedness. For example, even weak condition  $\| h\|_{L_2(P)}\leq c\| h\|_{L_1(P)}$  yields nontrivial small-ball estimate. Moreover, the equivalence between higher-order moments and second-order moment such as  $\| h\|_{L_p(P)}\leq c\| h\|_{L_2(P)}$  also leads to small-ball condition (Lecue & Mendelson, 2016). Based on these observations, condition (b) of Assumption 4 is generally implied when we consider each local distribution  $D_{i}$  as a random variable according to client distribution  $P$ . Let us discuss condition (a) of Assumption 4 in more detail. Note that the establishment of this assumption 4 only requires  $\mathcal{H}\subset L_2(D)$  with high probability, where  $D$  is the semi-empirical distribution. This requirement is not too restrictive since the elements of  $D$  are i.i.d sampled from  $P$ . To our knowledge, this is the first time that small-ball condition is used under heterogeneous data generating assumption.

# 4.1 LEARNING RATES FOR PARTICIPATING CLIENTS WITH SMALL-BALL CONDITION

We first describe the basic idea of generalization analysis for participating clients. Recall that  $\widehat{h}^*$  is the minimizer of semi-empirical risk  $\mathcal{L}_D(h)$  in  $\mathcal{H}$ . In this subsection we focus on the measure  $\| h - \widehat{h}^*\|_{L_2(D)}^2$ , which represents the distance between  $h$  and  $\widehat{h}^*$  with respect to semi-empirical distribution  $D$ . For quadratic loss and every  $h\in \mathcal{H}$ , we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {L} _ {S} (h) - \mathcal {L} _ {S} \left(\widehat {h} ^ {*}\right) = \frac {1}{m n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \left[ \left(h \left(X _ {i} ^ {j}\right) - Y _ {i} ^ {j}\right) ^ {2} - \left(\widehat {h} ^ {*} \left(X _ {i} ^ {j}\right) - Y _ {i} ^ {j}\right) ^ {2} \right] (1) \\ = \frac {1}{m n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \left(h - \widehat {h} ^ {*}\right) ^ {2} \left(X _ {i} ^ {j}\right) + \frac {2}{m n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \xi_ {i} ^ {j} \left(h - \widehat {h} ^ {*}\right) \left(X _ {i} ^ {j}\right), (2) \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\xi_i^j = \widehat{h}^* (X_i^j) - Y_i^j$ . Since  $\widehat{h}$  is the minimizer of empirical risk  $\mathcal{L}_S(h)$ , we have  $\mathcal{L}_S(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_S(\widehat{h}^*) \leq 0$ . If on an event  $\| h - \widehat{h}^*\|_{L_2(D)}$  is large, then the summation of two terms in (2) is larger than 0 with high probability. It follows that with high probability  $\| \widehat{h} - \widehat{h}^*\|_{L_2(D)}$  is small since  $\mathcal{L}_S(\widehat{h}) - \mathcal{L}_S(\widehat{h}^*) \leq 0$ .

Let  $\{(X_i^j,Y_i^j)\}_{(i,j) = (1,1)}^{(m,n)}$  be global data samples whose elements  $\{(X_i^j,Y_i^j)\}_{j = 1}^n$  are i.i.d random pairs at  $i$ -th client. The analysis of the first term in (2) involves the following definition of Rademacher complexity.

Definition 3. We define  $\mathcal{H} - \widehat{h}^* = \{h - \widehat{h}^* : h \in \mathcal{H}\}$  and denote by  $B_2^m$  the  $L_2(D)$  unit ball entered at  $\widehat{h}^*$ , that is  $B_2^m = \{h \in \mathcal{H} : \|h - \widehat{h}^*\|_{L_2(D)} \leq 1\}$ . For every  $\eta > 0$ , define

$$
\omega_ {m n} (\mathcal {H} - \widehat {h} ^ {*}, \eta) := \inf  \left\{s > 0: \mathbb {E} \left[ \sup  _ {h \in (\mathcal {H} - \widehat {h} ^ {*}) \cap s B _ {2} ^ {m}} \left| \frac {1}{m n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \sigma_ {i} ^ {j} h (X _ {i} ^ {j}) \right| \right] \leq \eta s, \right\}
$$

where  $\sigma_{i}^{j}$  are Rademacher random variables.

The quantity  $\omega_{mn}(\mathcal{H} - \widehat{h}^*,\eta)$  measures the Rademacher complexity of the localized function set  $\{h - \widehat{h}^{*}:h\in \mathcal{H}\cap sB_{2}^{m}\}$ . Note that  $\omega_{mn}(\mathcal{H} - \widehat{h}^{*},\eta)$  depends only on the hypothesis class  $\mathcal{H}$  and global input samples drawn from semi-empirical distribution  $D$ .

Moreover, the analysis of the second term in (2) requires the following definition.

Definition 4. For every  $0 < \delta < 1$  and  $\eta > 0$ , define

$$
\kappa_ {m n} (\eta , \delta) := \inf  \left\{s > 0: \mathbb {P} \left[ \sup  _ {h \in \left(\mathcal {H} - \hat {h} ^ {*}\right) \cap s B _ {2} ^ {m}} \left| \frac {1}{m n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \sigma_ {i} ^ {j} \xi_ {i} ^ {j} h (X _ {i} ^ {j}) \right| \leq \eta s ^ {2} \right] \geq 1 - \delta , \right\}
$$

where  $\xi_{i}^{j} = h^{*}(X_{i}^{j}) - Y_{i}^{j}$  and  $\sigma_{i}^{j}$  are Rademacher random variables.

It is important to note that the quantity  $\kappa_{mn}(\eta, \delta)$  measures the maximal correlation between localized function set  $\{h(X_i^j)\}_{(i,j)=(1,1)}^{(m,n)}$  and noise vector  $\{\sigma_i^j\xi_i^j\}_{(i,j)=(1,1)}^{(m,n)}$ . Intuitively,  $\kappa_{mn}(\eta, \delta)$  reflects the noise level in learning problems.

Theorem 5. Fix  $\tau >0$  for which  $Q_{\mathcal{H} - \mathcal{H}}(2\tau) > 0$  and set  $\eta < \tau^2 Q_{\mathcal{H} - \mathcal{H}}(2\tau) / 32$ . If every random variable  $\left(\xi_i^j h(X_i^j) - \mathbb{E}[\xi_i^j h(X_i^j)]\right)$  for all  $h\in \mathcal{H} - \widehat{h}^{*}$  is Sub-Weibull. For every  $0 < \delta < 1$ ,  $0 < \iota < \frac{1}{4}$  and sufficiently large  $mn$ , with probability at least  $1 - \delta -\exp \left(-mnQ_{\mathcal{H} - \mathcal{H}}^2 (2\tau) / 2\right)$  one has

$$
\left\| \widehat {h} - \widehat {h} ^ {*} \right\| _ {L _ {2} (D)} \leq 2 \max  \left\{\kappa_ {m n} (\eta , \delta / 4), \left(\frac {1}{m n}\right) ^ {- \frac {1}{4} + \iota} \right\}.
$$

Remark 6. To the best of our knowledge, Theorem 5 provide the first result on the generalization error of heterogeneous federated learning with heavy-tailed losses. It suggests that both hypothesis 'size' and noise level play important roles in the generalization error of heterogeneous learning problems.

# 4.2 LEARNING RATES FOR UNPARTICIPATING CLIENTS WITH SMALL-BALL CONDITION

In the analysis of generalization error for unparticipating clients, we focus on the measure  $\| h - h^{*} \|_{L_{2}(P)}^{2}$ , which represents the distance between  $h$  and  $h^{*}$  with respect to meta-distribution  $P$ . The analysis of generalization error for unparticipating clients follows a similar path to the previous analysis. Let  $\{(X_{i}, Y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{m}$  be dataset whose elements are sampled across the two-level framework, that is  $\mathbb{E}[(X_{i}, Y_{i})] = \mathbb{E}_{D_{i} \sim P} \mathbb{E}_{(X_{i}, Y_{i}) \sim D_{i}}[(X_{i}, Y_{i})]$ . We present the different definitions of Rademacher complexity terms in the following.

Definition 5. We define  $\mathcal{H} - h^* = \{h - h^* : h \in \mathcal{H}\}$  and denote by  $B_2$  the  $L_2(P)$  unit ball entered at  $h^*$ . For every  $\eta > 0$ , define

$$
\omega_ {m} (\mathcal {H} - h ^ {*}, \eta) := \inf  \left\{s > 0: \mathbb {E} \left[ \sup  _ {h \in (\mathcal {H} - h ^ {*}) \cap s B _ {2}} \left| \frac {1}{m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \sigma_ {i} h (X _ {i}) \right| \right] \leq \eta s, \right\}
$$

where  $\sigma_{i}$  are Rademacher random variables.

The quantity  $\omega_{mn}(\mathcal{H} - h^*,\eta)$  measures the localized complexity of  $\{h - h^{*}:h\in \mathcal{H}\cap sB_{2}\}$ .

Definition 6. For every  $0 < \delta < 1$  and  $\eta > 0$ , define

$$
\kappa_ {m} (\eta , \delta) := \inf  \left\{s > 0: \mathbb {P} \left[ \sup  _ {h \in \left(\mathcal {H} - h ^ {*}\right) \cap s B _ {2}} \left| \frac {1}{m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \sigma_ {i} \xi_ {i} [ h (X _ {i}) ] \right| \leq \eta s ^ {2} \right] \geq 1 - \delta , \right\}
$$

where  $\xi_{i} = h^{*}(X_{i}) - Y_{i}$ ,  $\sigma_{i}$  are Rademacher random variables.

Theorem 6. Fix  $\tau >0$  for which  $Q_{\mathcal{H} - \mathcal{H}}(2\tau ,P) > 0$  and set  $\eta <  \tau^{2}Q_{\mathcal{H} - \mathcal{H}}(2\tau) / 32$  . If every random variable  $(\xi_ih(X_i) - \mathbb{E}[\xi_ih(X_i)])$  for all  $h\in \mathcal{H} - h^*$  is Sub-Weibull. For every  $0 <   \delta <  1$ $0 <   \iota <  \frac{1}{4}$  and sufficiently large m, with probability at least  $1 - \delta -\exp \left(-mQ_{\mathcal{H} - \mathcal{H}}^{2}(2\tau ,p) / 2\right)$  one has

$$
\left\| \widehat {h} ^ {*} - h ^ {*} \right\| _ {L _ {2} (P)} \leq 2 \max  \left\{\kappa_ {m} (\eta , \delta / 4), \left(\frac {1}{m}\right) ^ {- \frac {1}{4} + \iota} \right\}.
$$

Remark 7. Theorem 6 provide the first result on the generalization error of unparticipating clients in heterogeneous federated learning with heavy-tailed losses.

# 5 RELATED WORK

Generalization Error for Heterogeneous Federated Learning. Several attempts have been made in the analysis of generalization error for heterogeneous federated learning. We compare our results with most related works in Table 1. Complexity-based bounds for participating clients are derived in the work of (Mohri et al., 2019), who present high probability slow rates of order  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mn}}\right)$

for bounded losses. Fast rates bounds are obtained based on stability tools in (Chen et al., 2021; Fallah et al., 2021). However, their results are in expectation form. Among the existing theoretical work, different measurements are used to model the heterogeneity of local distributions. These measurements include gradient dissimilarity and parameter dissimilarity of local optimal models. Here we argue that it is more natural to make an assumption from the perspective of the data-generating process. Therefore, in this paper, we assume that the local distributions are sampled from a higher meta-distribution.

A similar two-level distribution framework has been used in the analysis of meta-learning. However, the learning scenarios and objectives of federated learning are different from that of meta-learning. The goal of meta-learning is to choose an optimal hypothesis space  $\mathcal{H}$  from the hypothesis space family  $\mathbb{H}$ . Ideally, the chosen hypothesis  $\mathcal{H}$  should contain good hypothesis  $h\in \mathcal{H}$  for each distribution  $D_{i}$  sampled from the meta distribution  $P$ . In this paper, we focus on the performance of common model  $\widehat{h}$  trained by participating clients. The performance of the common model is measured by the population risk with respect to meta distribution  $P$ . Another line of research closely related to heterogeneous federated learning is domain adaptation/generalization. In this line, possibly the results in (Li et al., 2022) are most relevant to ours.

Generalization error for Unbounded losses. The unbounded assumption brings two major challenges to complexity-based generalization analysis. One is that the two-side concentration inequalities do not hold when the losses are heavy-tailed. The other is that the standard techniques used to upper bound the complexity of hypothesis space are developed for bounded losses. The straightforward way to avoid these two challenges is to assume there exists an envelope function with respect to the underlying distribution and hypothesis class (Adamczak, 2008; Lecué & Mendelson, 2012). Small-ball method is first proposed to replace the concentration tools for empirical process in (Mendelson, 2015) and further developed in (Mendelson, 2018). Inspired by the small-ball method, Offset Rademacher complexity-based method provides another replacement for two-side concentration inequality (Liang et al., 2015). However, most existing generalization bounds for unbounded losses are derived in the i.i.d setting. Roy et al. (2021) extend the small-ball method in the dependent data setting. In this paper, we focus on the heterogeneous federated learning scenario with unbounded losses, where the samples are independent but non-identically distributed.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We present a systematic generalization analysis of heterogeneous distributed learning. Our analysis captures the generalization performance of the learned model on both participating and unparticipating clients. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis under the assumption that the local distributions are sampled from a meta-distribution. We recover the current state of art guarantees without using bounded assumptions. Moreover, under the empirical risk minimization setting, we derive fast generalization rates in our two-level distribution setting.
