# ABSTRACT

The need of collecting large quantities of labeled training data for each new task has limited the usefulness of deep neural networks. Given data from a set of source tasks, this limitation can be overcome using two transfer learning approaches: few-shot learning (FSL) and self-supervised learning (SSL). The former aims to learn 'how to learn' by designing learning episodes using source tasks to simulate the challenge of solving the target new task with few labeled samples. In contrast, the latter exploits an annotation-free pretext task across all source tasks in order to learn generalizable feature representations. In this work, we propose a novel Instance-level and Episode-level Pretext Task (IEPT) framework that seamlessly integrates SSL into FSL. Specifically, given an FSL episode, we first apply geometric transformations to each instance to generate extended episodes. At the instance-level, transformation recognition is performed as per standard SSL. Importantly, at the episode-level, two SSL-FSL hybrid learning objectives are devised: (1) The consistency across the predictions of an FSL classifier from different extended episodes is maximized as an episode-level pretext task. (2) The features extracted from each instance across different episodes are integrated to construct a single FSL classifier for meta-learning. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model (i.e., FSL with IEPT) achieves the new state-of-the-art.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016b; Huang et al., 2017) have seen tremendous successes in a wide range of application fields, especially in visual recognition. However, the powerful learning ability of CNNs depends on a large amount of manually labeled training data. In practice, for many visual recognition tasks, sufficient manual annotation is either too costly to collect or not feasible (e.g., for rare object classes). This has severely limited the usefulness of CNNs for real-world application scenarios. Attempts have been made recently to mitigate such a limitation from two distinct perspectives, resulting in two popular research lines, both of which aim to transfer knowledge learned from the data of a set of source tasks to a new target one: few-shot learning (FSL) and self-supervised learning (SSL).

FSL (Fei-Fei et al., 2006; Vinyals et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2017; Snell et al., 2017; Sung et al., 2018) typically takes a 'learning to learn' or meta-learning paradigm. That is, it aims to learn an algorithm for learning from few labeled samples, which generalizes well across any tasks. To that end, it adopts an episodic training strategy – the source tasks are arranged into learning episodes, each of which contains  $n$  classes and  $k$  labeled samples per class to simulate the setting for the target task. Part of the CNN model (e.g., feature extraction subnet, classification layers, or parameter initialization) is then meta-learned for rapid adaptation to new tasks.

In contrast, SSL (Doersch et al., 2015; Noroozi & Favaro, 2016; Iizuka et al., 2016; Doersch & Zisserman, 2017; Noroozi et al., 2018) does not require the source data to be annotated. Instead, it exploits an annotation-free pretext task on the source task data in the hope that a task-genericizable feature representation can be learned from the source tasks for easy adoption or adaptation in a target task. Such a pretext task gets its self-supervised signal at the per-instance level. Examples include rotation and context prediction (Gidaris et al., 2018; Doersch et al., 2015), jigsaw solving (Noroozi & Favaro, 2016), and colorization (Iizuka et al., 2016; Larsson et al., 2016). Since these pretext tasks are class-agnostic, solving them leads to the learning of transferable knowledge.

Figure 1: Schematic of our approach to FSL. Given an FSL training episode, we apply 2D rotations by 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees to each instance to generate four extended episodes. After going through a feature extraction CNN, four losses over three branches are designed over these episodes: (1) In the top branch, we employ a rotation classifier to recognize the geometric transformation for each image with the instance-level SSL loss  $\mathcal{L}_{inst}$ . (2) In the middle branch, an FSL classifier is exploited to predict the FSL classification probabilities for each episode. We maximize the classification consistency among the extended episodes by forcing the four probability distributions to be consistent using  $\mathcal{L}_{epis}$ . The average supervised FSL loss  $\mathcal{L}_{aux}$  is also computed. (3) In the bottom branch, we utilize an integration transformer module to first refine and then fuse the features extracted from each instance with different rotation transformations; they are then used to compute an integrated FSL classification loss  $\mathcal{L}_{integ}$ . Among the four losses,  $\mathcal{L}_{inst}$  and  $\mathcal{L}_{epis}$  are the self-supervised losses, and  $\mathcal{L}_{aux}$  and  $\mathcal{L}_{integ}$  are the supervised losses.

Since both FSL and SSL aim to reduce the need of collecting a large amount of labeled training data for a target task by transferring knowledge from a set of source tasks, it is natural to consider combining them in a single framework. Indeed, two recent works (Gidaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020) proposed to integrate SSL into FSL by adding an auxiliary SSL pretext task in an FSL model. It showed that the SSL learning objective is complementary to that of FSL and combining them leads to improved FSL performance. However, in (Gidaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020), SSL is combined with FSL in a superficial way: it is only taken as a separate auxiliary task for each single training instance and has no effect on the episodic training pipeline of the FSL model. Importantly, by ignoring the class labels of samples, the instance-level SSL learning objective is weak on its own. Since meta-learning across episodes is the essence of most contemporary FSL models, we argue that adding instance-level SSL pretext tasks alone fails to exploit fully the complementarity of the aforementioned FSL and SSL, for which a closer and deeper integration is needed.

To that end, in this paper we propose a novel Instance-level and Episode-level Pretext Task (IEPT) framework for few-shot recognition. Apart from adding an instance-level pretext SSL task as in (Gidaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020), we introduce two episode-level SSL-FSL hybrid learning objectives for seamless SSL-FSL integration. Concretely, as illustrated in Figure 1, our full model has three additional learning objectives (besides the standard FSL one): (1) Different rotation transformations are applied to each original few-shot episode to generate a set of extended episodes, where each image has a rotation label for the instance-level pretext task (i.e., to predict the rotation label). (2) The consistency across the predictions of an FSL classifier from different extended episodes is maximized as an episode-level pretext task. For each training image, the rotation transformation does not change its semantic content and hence its class label; the FSL classifier predictions across different extended episodes thus should be consistent, hence the consistency regularization objective. (3) The correlation of features across instances from these extended episodes is modeled by a transformer-based attention module, optimizing the fusion of the features of each instance/image and its various rotation-transformed versions. Importantly, with these three new learning objectives introduced in IEPT, any meta-learning based FSL model can now benefit more from SSL by fully exploiting their complementarity.

Our main contributions are three-fold: (1) For the first time, we propose both instance-level and episode-level pretext tasks (IEPT) for integrating SSL into FSL. The episode-level pretext task enables episodic training of SSL and hence closer integration of SSL with FSL. (2) In addition to these pretext tasks, FSL further benefits from SSL by integrating features extracted from various rotation-transformed versions of the original training instances. The optimal way of feature integration is learned using a transformer-based attention module. (3) Extensive experiments show that our model (i.e., FSL with IEPT) achieves the new state-of-the-art. The code will be released soon.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Few-Shot Learning. The recent FSL studies are dominated by meta-learning based methods. They can be divided into three groups: (1) Metric-based methods (Vinyals et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017; Sung et al., 2018; Allen et al., 2019; Xing et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019a,b; Wu et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2020; Afrasiyabi Arman, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) aim to learn the distance metric between feature embeddings. The focus of these methods is often on meta-learning of a feature-extraction CNN, whilst the classifiers used are of simple form such as a nearest-neighbor classifier. (2) Optimization-based methods (Finn et al., 2017; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017; Rusu et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019) learn to optimize the model rapidly given a few labeled samples per class in the new task. (3) Model-based methods (Santoro et al., 2016; Munkhdalai & Yu, 2017; Mishra et al., 2018) focus on designing either specific model structures or parameters capable of rapid updating. Apart from these three groups of methods, other FSL methods have attempted feature hallucination (Schwartz et al., 2018; Hariharan & Girshick, 2017; Gao et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Tsutsui et al., 2019) which generates additional samples from the given few shots for network finetuning, and parameter predicting (Qiao et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2018; Gidaris & Komodakis, 2019; 2018) which learns to predict part of the parameters of a network given few samples of new classes for quick adaptation. In this work, we adopt the metric-based Prototypical Network (ProtoNet) (Snell et al., 2017) as the basic FSL classifier for the main instantiation of our IEPT framework due to its simplicity and popularity. However, we show that any meta-learning based FSL method can be combined with our IEPT (see results in Figure 2(c)).

Self-Supervised Learning. In SSL, it is assumed that the source task data is label-free and a pretext task is designed to provide self-supervision signals at the instance-level. Existing SSL approaches differ mainly in the pretext task design. These include predicting the rotation angle (Gidaris et al., 2018) and the context of image patch (Doersch et al., 2015; Nathan Mundhenk et al., 2018), jigsaw solving (Noroozi & Favaro, 2016; Noroozi et al., 2018) (i.e. shuffling and then reordering image patch), and performing images reversion (Iizuka et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2016; Larsson et al., 2016). SSL has been shown to be beneficial to various down-steam tasks such as semantic object matching (Novotny et al., 2018), object segmentation (Ji et al., 2019) and object detection (Doersch & Zisserman, 2017) by learning transferable feature presentations for these tasks.

Integrating Self-Supervised Learning into Few-Shot Learning. To the best of our knowledge, only two recent works (Gidaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020) have attempted combining SSL with FSL. However, the integration of SSL into FSL is often shallow: the original FSL training pipeline is intact; in the meantime, an additional loss on each image w.r.t. a self-supervised signal like the rotation angle or relative patch location is introduced. With pretext tasks solely at the instance level, combining the two approaches (i.e., SSL and FSL) can only be superficial without fully exploiting the episodic training pipeline unique to FSL. Different from (Gidaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020), we introduce an episode-level pretext task to integrate SSL into the episodic training in FSL fully. Specifically, the consistency across the predictions of an FSL classifier from different extended episodes is maximized to reflect the fact that various rotation transformations should not alter the class-label prediction. Moreover, features of each instance and its various rotation-transformed versions are now fused for FSL classification, to integrate SSL with FSL for the supervised classification task. Our experimental results show that thanks to the closer integration of SSL and FSL, our IEPT clearly outperforms (Gidaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020) (see Table 1).

# 3 METHODOLOGY

# 3.1 PRELIMINARY

Problem Setting. Given an  $n$ -way  $k$ -shot FSL task sampled from a test set  $\mathcal{D}_t$ , to imitate the test setting, an FSL model is typically trained in an episodic way. That is,  $n$ -way  $k$ -shot episodes are randomly sampled from a training set  $\mathcal{D}_s$ , where the class label space of  $\mathcal{D}_s$  has no overlap with that of  $\mathcal{D}_t$ . Each episode  $E_{e}$  contains a support set  $\mathcal{S}_e$  and a query set  $\mathcal{Q}_e$ . Concretely, we first randomly sample a set of  $n$  classes  $\mathcal{C}_e$  from the training set, and then generate  $\mathcal{S}_e$  and  $\mathcal{Q}_e$  by sampling  $k$  support samples and  $q$  query samples from each class in  $\mathcal{C}_e$ , respectively. Formally, we have  $\mathcal{S}_e = \{(x_i,y_i)|y_i\in \mathcal{C}_e,i = 1,\dots,n\times k\}$  and  $\mathcal{Q}_e = \{(x_i,y_i)|y_i\in \mathcal{C}_e,i = 1,\dots,n\times q\}$ , where  $\mathcal{S}_e\bigcap \mathcal{Q}_e = \emptyset$ . For simplicity, we denote  $l_k = n\times k$  and  $l_q = n\times q$ . In the meta-training stage,

the training process has an inner and an outer loop in each episode: in the inner loop, the model is updated using  $S_{e}$ ; its performance is then evaluated on the query set  $Q_{e}$  in the outer loop to update the model parameters or algorithm that one wants to meta-learn.

Basic FSL Classifier. We employ ProtoNet (Snell et al., 2017) as the basic FSL model. This model has a feature-extraction CNN and a simple non-parametric classifier. The parameter of the feature extractor is to be meta-learned. Concretely, in the inner loop of an episode, ProtoNet fixes the feature extractor and computes the mean feature embedding for each class as follows:

$$
h _ {c} = \frac {1}{k} \cdot \sum_ {\left(x _ {i}, y _ {i}\right) \in \mathcal {S} _ {e}} f _ {\phi} \left(x _ {i}\right) \cdot \mathbb {I} \left(y _ {i} = c\right), \tag {1}
$$

where class  $c \in \mathcal{C}_e$ ,  $f_{\phi}$  is a feature extractor with learnable parameters  $\phi$ , and  $\mathbb{I}$  is the indicator function. By computing the distance between the feature embedding of each query sample and that of the corresponding class, the loss function used to meta-learn  $\phi$  in the outer loop is defined as:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {f s l} \left(\mathcal {S} _ {e}, \mathcal {Q} _ {e}\right) = \frac {1}{\left| \mathcal {Q} _ {e} \right|} \sum_ {\left(x _ {i}, y _ {i}\right) \in \mathcal {Q} _ {e}} - \log \frac {\exp \left(- d \left(f _ {\phi} \left(x _ {i}\right) , h _ {y _ {i}}\right)\right)}{\sum_ {c \in \mathcal {C} _ {e}} \exp \left(- d \left(f _ {\phi} \left(x _ {i}\right) , h _ {c}\right)\right)}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $d(\cdot ,\cdot)$  denotes a distance function (e.g., the  $l_{2}$  distance).

# 3.2 PRETEXT TASKS IN IEPT

The schematic of our IEPT is illustrated in Figure 1. We first define a set of 2D-rotation operators  $\mathcal{G} = \{g_r|r = 0,\dots,R - 1\}$ , where  $g_{r}$  means the operator of rotating the image by  $r^{*}90$  degrees and  $R$  is the total number of rotations ( $R = 4$  in our implementation). Given an original episode  $E_{e} = \{\mathcal{S}_{e},\mathcal{Q}_{e}\}$  as described in Sec. 3.1, we utilize the 2D-rotation operators from  $\mathcal{G}$  in turn to transform each image in  $E_{e}$ . This results in a set of  $R$  extended episodes (including the original one)  $E = \{\{\mathcal{S}_e^r,\mathcal{Q}_e^r\} |r = 0,\dots,R - 1\}$ , where  $\mathcal{S}_e^r = \{(x_i,y_i,r)|y_i\in C_e,i = 1,\dots,l_k\}$  and  $\mathcal{Q}_e^r = \{(x_i,y_i,r)|y_i\in C_e,i = 1,\dots,l_k,l_k + 1,\dots,l_k + l_q\}$ . Now each episode is denoted as  $E_{e}^{r} = \{(x_{i},y_{i},r)|y_{i}\in$ $C_e,i = 1,\dots,l_k,l_k + 1,\dots,l_k + l_q\}$ , where the first  $l_{k}$  samples are from  $\mathcal{S}_e^r$  and the rest from  $\mathcal{Q}_e^r$ . Note that  $\{\mathcal{S}_e^0,\mathcal{Q}_e^0\}$  is the original episode  $\{\mathcal{S}_e,\mathcal{Q}_e\}$ . With the rotation transformations, each sample  $(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i})$  in  $E$  carries a class label  $y_{i}$  for supervised learning (from the inherent class) and a label  $r_i$  from the rotation operator for self-supervised learning. After generating the set of extended episodes  $E$ , the feature extractor  $f_{\phi}$  is applied to each image  $x_{i}$  in  $E$ . On these episodes, we design two self-supervised pretext tasks, one at the instance-level and the other episode-level.

Instance-Level Pretext Task. The instance-level task is to recognize different rotation transformations. The idea is that if the model to be meta-learned here (i.e.,  $f_{\phi}$ ) can be used to distinguish different transformations, it must understand the canonical poses of objects (e.g., animals have legs touching the ground and trees have leaves on top), a vital part of class-agnostic and thus transferable knowledge. With the self-supervised rotation label  $r_i$ , we consider the mapping:  $f_{\theta_{rot}}: x_i \mapsto r_i$  for each instance  $(x_i, y_i, r_i) \in E$ , where  $f_{\theta_{rot}}$  is a rotation classifier with learnable parameters  $\theta_{rot}$ . Given the input pair  $(x_i, r_i)$ , the total instance-level rotation loss is a cross-entropy loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {i n s t}} = \frac {1}{R \left(l _ {k} + l _ {q}\right)} \sum_ {r = 0} ^ {R - 1} \sum_ {\left(x _ {i}, y _ {i}, r _ {i}\right) \in E _ {e} ^ {r}} - \log \frac {\exp \left(\left[ f _ {\theta_ {\text {r o t}}} \left(f _ {\phi} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) \right] _ {r _ {i}}\right)}{\sum_ {r ^ {\prime} = 0} ^ {R - 1} \exp \left(\left[ f _ {\theta_ {\text {r o t}}} \left(f _ {\phi} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) \right] _ {r ^ {\prime}}\right)}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $[f_{\theta_{rot}}(f_{\phi}(x_i))]\in \mathbb{R}^R$  is the rotation scoring vector and  $[\cdot ]_r$  means taking the  $r$ -th element.

Episode-Level Pretext Task. We design the episode-level task based on a simple principle: although different extended episodes contain images with different rotation transformations, these transformations do not change their class labels. Consequently, the FSL classifier should produce consistent probability distributions for each instance across different extended episodes. Such consistency can be measured using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Formally, for each extended episode  $\{S_e^r,\mathcal{Q}_e^r\}$  in  $E$ , we first define the probability distribution of FSL classification over the query set  $\mathcal{Q}_e^r$  as  $\mathcal{P}_e^r = [p_1^r;\dots;p_{l_q}^r]\in \mathbb{R}^{l_q\times n}$ , where  $p_i^r\in \mathbb{R}^n$  is the probability distribution for  $x_{i}$  in  $\mathcal{Q}_e^r$  with its  $c$ -th element  $[p_i^r ]_c$  ( $c = 1,\ldots ,n$ ) being:

$$
\left[ p _ {i} ^ {r} \right] _ {c} = \frac {\exp \left(- d \left(f _ {\phi} \left(x _ {i}\right) , h _ {c} ^ {r}\right)\right)}{\sum_ {c ^ {\prime}} \exp \left(- d \left(f _ {\phi} \left(x _ {i}\right) , h _ {c ^ {\prime}} ^ {r}\right)\right)}. \tag {4}
$$

The above probability is computed as in Sec. 3.1 and the class embedding  $h_c^r$  is obtained from  $S_e^r$ . The mean probability distribution of the  $R$  extended episodes is thus given by:

$$
\hat {p} _ {i} = \frac {1}{R} \cdot \sum_ {r = 0} ^ {R - 1} p _ {i} ^ {r}. \tag {5}
$$

The total episode-level consistency regularization loss is computed with the KL divergence loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {e p i s} = \frac {1}{R l _ {q}} \cdot \sum_ {r = 0} ^ {R - 1} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {l _ {q}} \operatorname {m e a n} \left(p _ {i} ^ {r} \left(\log p _ {i} ^ {r} - \log \hat {p} _ {i}\right)\right). \tag {6}
$$

where mean  $(\cdot)$  is an element-wise averaging function.

# 3.3 INTEGRATED FSL TASK

The two tasks introduced so far are self-supervised tasks without using the class labels in the query set. Now we describe how in the supervised classification task, the extended episodes can be used.

Given the set of extended episodes  $E$ , we denote the feature set of  $E$  as  $E_{emb}$ , where  $E_{emb} = \{f_{\phi}(x_i) | (x_i, y_i, r) \in E_e^r, r = 0, \dots, R - 1, i = 1, \dots, l_k + l_q\}$ . Note that each extended episode in  $E$  corresponds to one specific rotation transformation of the same set of images from the original episode  $E_e$ . Therefore, in order to capture the correlation among instances with different transformations and learn how best combine them to form the class mean for meta-learning, an instance attention module is deployed w.r.t. each image in  $E_e$  (i.e., all images are assumed to be independent). Specifically, based on  $E_{emb}$ , we construct the feature tensor  $F \in \mathbb{R}^{(l_k + l_q) \times R \times d}$ , where  $d$  is the feature dimension. We then adopt a transformer to obtain the integrated representation for FSL classification.

The transformer architecture is based on a self-attention mechanism, as in (Vaswani et al., 2017). It receives the triplet input  $(F,F,F)$  as  $(Q,K,V)$  (Query, Key, and Value, respectively). With  $F^{(i)}$  being the  $i$ -th row of  $F$  (w.r.t. the  $i$ -th image in  $E_{e}$ ), the attentive module is defined as:

$$
\left(F _ {Q} ^ {(i)}, F _ {K} ^ {(i)}, F _ {V} ^ {(i)}\right) = \left(F ^ {(i)} W _ {Q}, F ^ {(i)} W _ {K}, F ^ {(i)} W _ {V}\right), \tag {7}
$$

$$
F _ {a t t} ^ {(i)} = F ^ {(i)} + \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\frac {F _ {Q} ^ {(i)} \left(F _ {K} ^ {(i)}\right) ^ {T}}{\sqrt {d _ {K}}}\right) F _ {V} ^ {(i)}, \tag {8}
$$

where  $d_{K} = d$ , and  $W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V}$  represent the parameters of three fully-connected layers respectively (the parameters of the integration transformer are collected as  $\theta_{int}$  in this work). Note that the key and value are computed from each image and its augmented versions (with different rotation transformations), i.e., they are computed from all images independently. With the attentive feature  $F_{att} \in \mathbb{R}^{(l_k + l_q) \times R \times d}$ , the integrated representation  $F_{integ} = [F^S; F^Q] \in \mathbb{R}^{(l_k + l_q) \times Rd}$  ( $F^S$  and  $F^Q$  are respectively for the support set and the query set) is given by:

$$
F _ {i n t e g} = \text {f l a t t e n} \left(F _ {a t t}\right), \tag {9}
$$

where  $\text{flatten}(\cdot)$  denotes flattening  $F_{att}$  along the last two dimensions, i.e., concatenating the attentive features from different extended episodes for the corresponding images. The integrated representation is then inputted to the FSL classifier to define the FSL classification loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {i n t e g}} = \frac {1}{l _ {q}} \cdot \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {l _ {q}} - \log \frac {\exp \left(- d \left(F _ {i} ^ {Q} , h _ {y _ {i}} ^ {f}\right)\right)}{\sum_ {c \in \mathcal {C} _ {e}} \exp \left(- d \left(F _ {i} ^ {Q} , h _ {c} ^ {f}\right)\right)} \tag {10}
$$

where the class embedding  $h_c^f = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{l_k} F_i^S \cdot \mathbb{I}(y_i = c)$  is computed on the support set.

# 3.4 TOTAL LOSS

The total training loss for our full model consists of the self-supervised losses from the pretext tasks and the supervised losses from the FSL tasks. In this work, in addition to  $\mathcal{L}_{\text{integ}}$  in Eq. (10), another supervised FSL loss  $\mathcal{L}_{\text{aux}}$  is also used (see Figure 1).  $\mathcal{L}_{\text{aux}}$  is the average FSL classification loss over the extended episodes. Formally, it can be written as:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {a u x} = \frac {1}{R} \cdot \sum_ {r = 0} ^ {R - 1} \mathcal {L} _ {f s l} \left(\mathcal {S} _ {e} ^ {r}, \mathcal {Q} _ {e} ^ {r}\right) \tag {11}
$$

Therefore, the total loss  $\mathcal{L}_{total}$  for training our full model is given as follows:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {t o t a l}} = \underbrace {\overbrace {w _ {1} * \mathcal {L} _ {\text {i n s t}}} ^ {\text {i n s t a n c e - l e v e l}} + \overbrace {w _ {2} * \mathcal {L} _ {\text {e p i s}}} ^ {\text {e p i s o d e - l e v e l}}} _ {\text {s e l f - s u p e r v i s e d l o s s}} + \underbrace {w _ {3} * \mathcal {L} _ {\text {a u x}} + \mathcal {L} _ {\text {i n t e g}}} _ {\text {s u p e r v i s e d l o s s}}, \tag {12}
$$

where  $w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}$  are the loss weight hyperparameters. Our full algorithm is outlined in Appendix A.1.

# 3.5 INFERENCE

During the test stage, we only exploit the integrated representation  $F_{integ}$  for the final FSL prediction. The predicted class label for  $x_{i} \in \mathcal{Q}_{e}$  can be computed with Eq. (10) as:

$$
y _ {i} ^ {p r e d} = \operatorname * {a r g m a x} _ {y \in \mathcal {C} _ {e}} \frac {\exp \left(- d \left(F _ {i} ^ {Q} , h _ {y} ^ {f}\right)\right)}{\sum_ {c \in \mathcal {C} _ {e}} \exp \left(- d \left(F _ {i} ^ {Q} , h _ {c} ^ {f}\right)\right)}. \tag {13}
$$

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Datasets. Two widely-used FSL datasets are selected: miniImageNet (Vinyals et al., 2016) and tieredImageNet (Ren et al., 2018). The first dataset consists of a total number of 100 classes (600 images per class) and the train/Validation/test split is set to 64/16/20 classes as in (Ravi & Larochelle, 2017). The second dataset is a larger dataset including 608 classes totally (nearly 1,200 images per class), which is split into 351/97/160 classes for train/Validation/test. Both datasets are subsets sampled from ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015).

Feature Extractors. For fair comparison with published results, our IEPT adopts three widely-used feature extractors: Conv4-64 (Vinyals et al., 2016), Conv4-512, and ResNet-12 (He et al., 2016a). Particularly, Conv4-512 is almost the same as Conv4-64 except having a different channel size of the last convolution layer. To speed up the training process, as in many previous works (Ye et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Simon et al., 2020), we pretrain all the feature extractors on the training split of each dataset for our IEPT. Following (He et al., 2016a), we use the temperature scaling skill during the training phase. On both datasets, the input image size is  $84 \times 84$ . The output feature dimensions of Conv4-64, Conv4-512, and ResNet-12 are 64, 512, and 640, respectively.

Evaluation Metrics. We take the 5-way 5-shot (or 1-shot) FSL evaluation setting, as in previous works (Snell et al., 2017). We randomly sample 2,000 episodes from the test split and report the mean classification accuracy (top-1, %) as well as the  $95\%$  confidence interval.

Implementation Details. PyTorch is used for our implementation. We utilize the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) for Conv4-64 & Conv4-512 and the SGD optimizer for ResNet-12 to train our IEPT model. The hyperparameters of our IEPT model are selected according to the performance on the validation split. We will release the code soon.

# 4.2 MAIN RESULTS

Comparison to State-of-the-Arts. We compare our IEPT with two groups of baselines: (1) Recent SSL-based FSL methods (Gidaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020); (2) Representative/latest FSL methods (w/o SSL) (Snell et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Ravichandran et al., 2019; Simon et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). The comparative results for 5-way 1/5-shot FSL are shown in Table 1. We have the following observations: (1) When compared with the representative/latest FSL methods (w/o SSL), our IEPT achieves the best performance on all datasets and under all settings, validating the effectiveness of SSL with IEPT for FSL. (2) Our IEPT also clearly outperforms the two SSL-based FSL methods (Gidaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020) which only use instance-level pretext tasks, demonstrating the importance of closer/episode-level integration of SSL into FSL. (3) The improvements achieved by our IEPT over ProtoNet range from  $2\%$  to  $5\%$ . Since our IEPT takes ProtoNet as the baseline, the obtained margins provide direct evidence that SSL brings significant benefits to FSL. Note that our IEPT is also shown to be effective under both the fine-grained FSL and cross-domain FSL settings in Appendix A.6.

Ablation Study. Our full IEPT model is trained with four losses (see Eq. (12)), including two self-supervised losses and two supervised losses: the episode-level SSL loss  $\mathcal{L}_{epis}$ , the instance-level SSL loss  $\mathcal{L}_{inst}$ , the auxiliary FSL loss  $\mathcal{L}_{aux}$  and the integrated FSL loss  $L_{integ}$ . To demonstrate the contribution of each loss, we present the ablation study results for our full IEPT model in Table 2, where Conv4-64 is used as the backbone. We start with  $L_{integ}$  and then add the additional three losses successively. It can be observed that the performance of our model continuously increases when more losses are used, indicating that each loss contributes to the final performance.

# 4.3 FURTHER EVALUATIONS

Different Combination Methods over Episodes. We have introduced a transformer-based attention module to fuse the features of each instance from all extended episodes (and an integrated episode can be obtained) for the supervised classification task (see Sec. 3.3). In this experiment, we compare it with two alternative ways of across-episode integration: (1) Averaging extended episodes: the extended episodes are directly fused for FSL classification; (2) Averaging all episodes: the extended episodes as well as the integrated episode are fused for FSL classification. We present the comparative results on miniImageNet in Figure 2(a). For comprehensive comparison, the results of FSL with each single extended episode are also reported. We can observe that: (1) The performance of 'Episode  $0^{\circ}$  is the highest among the four baselines (i.e., FSL with single extended episode), perhaps because the

(b) Illustration of the effect of different choices of  $R$  on the performance of our model ( $R$  denotes the number of extended episodes used for SSL). (c) Comparative results obtained by our IEPT using different basic FSL classifiers (i.e. ProtoNet, FEAT, and IMP). It can be seen clearly that integrated episode-based fusion leads to more separation between classes. All figures present 5-way 1-shot/5-shot results on miniImageNet, using Conv4-64 as the feature extractor.

The 5-way 5-shot FSL (with Conv4-64) is adopted on miniImageNet.

feature extractor is pretrained on the original images without rotation transformations. (2) FSL by averaging extended episodes (i.e., 'Averaging extended episodes') indeed improves each of the four baselines. (3) FSL with integrated episode (i.e., 'Integrated episode') is superior to FSL by simply averaging extended episodes. (4) Comparing 'Integrated episode' with 'Averaging all episodes', the performance of FSL with integrated episode is more stable across different settings, furthering validating the usefulness of our across-episode integration. Overall, the episode-integration module is indeed effective in FSL with self-supervision. This is also supported by the visualization results in Figure 3 (see more visualization results in Appendices A.3 & A.5).

Different Number of Extended Episodes. In all the above experiments, the number of the extended episodes  $R$  is set to 4 (rotation by  $0^{\circ}$ ,  $90^{\circ}$ ,  $180^{\circ}$ ,  $270^{\circ}$ ). Figure 2(b) shows the impact of the value of  $R$ . Note that when  $R = 1$ , our IEPT model is equivalent to ProtoNet which is without self-supervision. It can be seen that the performance of our model consistently grows when  $R$  increases from 1 to 4. Additionally, the study on exploiting other pretext tasks for our IEPT is presented in Appendix A.2.

Different Basic FSL Classifiers. As mentioned in Sec. 3.1, we adopt ProtoNet as the basic FSL classifier due to its scalability and simplicity. To further show the effectiveness of our IEPT when other basic FSL classifiers are used, we provide the results obtained by our IEPT using ProtoNet, FEAT, and IMP for FSL in Figure 2(c). It can be clearly observed that our IEPT leads to an improvement of about  $1 - 4\%$  over each basic FSL method (ProtoNet, FEAT, or IMP), indicating that our IEPT can be applied to improve a variety of popular FSL methods.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We have proposed a novel Instance-level and Episode-level Pretext Task (IEPT) framework for integrating SSL into FSL. For the first time, we have introduced an episode-level pretext task for FSL with self-supervision, in addition to the conventional instance-level pretext task. Moreover, we have also developed an episode extension-integration framework by introducing an integration transformer module to fully exploit the extended episodes for FSL. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model (i.e., FSL with IEPT) achieves the new state-of-the-art. Our ongoing research directions include: exploring other episode-level pretext tasks for FSL with self-supervision, and applying FSL with self-supervision to other vision problems.
