# ABSTRACT

We empirically show that the test error of deep networks can be estimated by training the same architecture on the same training set but with two different runs of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and then measuring the disagreement rate between the two networks on unlabeled test data. This builds on — and is a stronger version of — the observation in Nakkiran & Bansal (2020), which requires the runs to be on separate training sets. We further theoretically show that this peculiar phenomenon arises from the well-calibrated nature of ensembles of SGD-trained models. This finding not only provides a simple empirical measure to directly predict the test error using unlabeled test data, but also establishes a new conceptual connection between generalization and calibration.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Consider the following intriguing observation made in Nakkiran & Bansal (2020). Train two networks of the same architecture to zero training error on two independently drawn datasets  $S_{1}$  and  $S_{2}$  of the same size. Both networks would achieve a test error (or equivalently, a generalization gap) of about the same value, denoted by  $\epsilon$ . Now, take a fresh unlabeled dataset  $U$  and measure the rate of disagreement of the predicted label between these two networks on  $U$ . Based on the triangle inequality, one can quickly surmise that this disagreement rate could lie anywhere between 0 and  $2\epsilon$ . However, across various training set sizes and for various models like neural networks, kernel SVMs and decision trees, Nakkiran & Bansal (2020) (or N&B'20 in short) report that the disagreement rate not only linearly correlates with the test error  $\epsilon$ , but nearly equals  $\epsilon$  (see first two plots in Fig 1). What brings about this unusual equality? Resolving this open question from N&B'20 could help us identify fundamental patterns in how neural networks make errors. That might further shed insight into generalization and other poorly understood empirical phenomena in deep learning.

In this work, we first identify a stronger observation. Consider two neural networks trained with the same hyperparameters and the same dataset, but with different random seeds (this could take the form e.g., of the data being presented in different random orders and/or by using a different random initialization of the network weights). We would expect the disagreement rate in this setting to be much smaller than in N&B'20, since both models see the same data. Yet, this is not the case:

we observe on the SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) datasets, and for variants of Residual Networks (He et al., 2016) and Convolutional Networks (Lin et al., 2013), that the disagreement rate is still approximately equal to the test error (see last two plots in Fig 1), only slightly deviating from the behavior in N&B'20. In fact, while N&B'20 show that the disagreement rate captures significant changes in test error with varying training set sizes, we highlight a much stronger behavior: the disagreement rate is able to capture even minute variations in the test error under varying hyperparameters like width and depth. Furthermore, we show that under certain training conditions, these properties even hold on many kinds of out-of-distribution data in the PACS dataset (Li et al., 2017), albeit not on all kinds.

The above observations not only raise deeper conceptual questions about the behavior of deep networks but also crucially yield a practical benefit. In particular, our disagreement rate does not require fresh labeled data (unlike the rate in N&B'20) and rather only requires fresh unlabeled data. Hence, ours is a more meaningful and practical estimator of test accuracy. In addition, unlike many other generalization measures (Jiang et al., 2018; Yak et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020b;a; Natekar & Sharma, 2020; Unterthiner et al., 2020) that merely correlate with the generalization gap or provide an overly conservative upper bound, this gives us a direct estimate of the generalization error, without the need for intricate proportionality constants and other multiplicative factors. In fact, computing the proportionality constants for existing measures often requires a labeled test dataset. Further unlike these existing measures, our estimator shows promise even under certain kinds of distribution shift.

In the second part of our work, we theoretically investigate these observations. Informally stated, we prove that if the ensemble of networks learned from different stochastic runs of the training algorithm (e.g., across different random seeds) is well-calibrated (i.e., the predicted probabilities are neither over-confident nor under-confident), then the disagreement rate equals the test error (in expectation over the stochasticity of the training algorithm). Indeed, such kinds of SGD-trained deep network ensembles are known to be naturally calibrated in practice (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Thus our work offers a valuable insight into the practical generalization properties of deep networks.

Overall, our work establishes a new connection between generalization and calibration via the idea of disagreement. This has both theoretical and practical implications in understanding generalization and the effect of stochasticity in SGD. To summarize, our contributions are as follows:

1. We prove that for any stochastic learning algorithm, if the algorithm leads to a well-calibrated ensemble, then the ensemble satisfies the Generalization Disagreement Equality $^{1}$  (GDE) in expectation over the stochasticity. Notably, our theory is general and makes no restrictions on the hypothesis class, the algorithm, the source of stochasticity, or the test distributions (which may be different from the training distribution).  
2. We empirically show that for Residual Networks (He et al., 2016), convolutional neural networks (Lin et al., 2013) and fully connected networks, and on CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), GDE is nearly satisfied, even on pairs of networks trained on the same data with different random seeds. This yields a simple method that in practice accurately estimates the test error using unlabeled data in these settings.  
3. We present preliminary observations showing that GDE is approximately satisfied even for certain distribution shifts within the PACS (Li et al., 2017) dataset. This implies that the disagreement rate can be a promising estimator even for out-of-distribution accuracy.  
4. We empirically find that different sources of stochasticity in SGD are almost equally effective in terms of their effect on GDE and calibration of deep models trained with SGD. We also explore the effect of pre-training on these phenomena.

# 2 RELATED WORKS

The generalization puzzle. Conventionally, generalization in deep learning has been studied through the lens of PAC-learning (Vapnik, 1971; Valiant, 1984). Under this framework, generalization is roughly equivalent to bounding the size of the search space of a learning algorithm. Representative works in this large area of research include Neyshabur et al. (2014; 2017; 2018); Dziugaite

& Roy (2017); Bartlett et al. (2017); Nagarajan & Kolter (2019b;c); Krishnan et al. (2019). Several works have questioned whether these approaches are truly making progress toward understanding generalization in overparameterized settings (Belkin et al., 2018; Nagarajan & Kolter, 2019a; Jiang et al., 2020b; Dziugaite et al., 2020). Subsequently, recent works have proposed unconventional ways to derive generalization bounds (Negrea et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Garg et al., 2021). Indeed, even our disagreement-based estimate marks a significant departure from complexity-based approaches to generalization bounds. Of particular relevance here is Garg et al. (2021), who leverage unlabeled data to derive their bound. Their computation requires modifying the original training set and then performing a careful early stopping during training, and is thus inapplicable to (and becomes vacuous for) interpolating models. On the other hand, our estimate of the test error applies to the original training process without modifications. However, our estimate comes with a guarantee only if we know a priori that the training procedure results in well-calibrated ensembles.

It is worth noting that the idea of using unlabeled data to estimate accuracy has already been explored in a variety of contexts (Donmez et al., 2010; Platanios et al., 2017; Jaffe et al., 2015; Steinhardt & Liang, 2016; ElSahar & Galle, 2019; Schelter et al., 2020; Chuang et al., 2020) especially under distribution shifts. These works either require further information (e.g., marginal distribution of the labels or the relationships between multiple learning tasks) or specialized training algorithms.

In a concurrent work, Chen et al. (2021) make similar discoveries regarding estimating accuracy via agreement, and its connections to calibration. The emphasis in their work is however different from ours. In particular, they take up the challenging goal of estimating accuracy under distribution shifts. To do this, they develop a novel sophisticated algorithm that over 5 or more iterations, learns and re-learns an ensemble of 5-20 models via self-training; the final ensemble is used to measure the disagreement with a given classifier. Our focus is primarily on the in-distribution setting where we show that a much simpler idea works i.e., we measure disagreement with only a pair of independently and naively SGD-trained models. Furthermore, we are more interested in understanding the nature of this phenomenon e.g., we examine the effects of different kinds of stochasticity, we introduce ensembles only as a vehicle to understand the phenomenon theoretically, and we prove how GDE holds under certain novel notions of calibration weaker than the existing ones.

Calibration. Calibration of a statistical model is the property that the probability obtained by the model reflects the true likelihood of the ground truth (Murphy & Epstein, 1967; Dawid, 1982). A well-calibrated model provides an accurate confidence on its prediction which is paramount for high-stake decision making and interpretability. In the context of deep learning, several works (Guo et al., 2017; Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017; Fort et al., 2019; Wu & Gales, 2021; Bai et al., 2021; Mukhoti et al., 2021) have found that while individual neural networks are usually over-confident about their predictions, ensembles of several independently and stochastically trained models tend to be naturally well-calibrated. In particular, there are two types of ensembles that have typically been studied: (a) ensembles where each member is trained by independently sampling training data (with replacement), also called bagging (Breiman, 1996) and (b) ensembles where each member is trained on the same data, but with different random seeds (e.g., different random initialization and data ordering), also called deep ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). The latter typically achieves better accuracy and calibration (Nixon et al., 2020).

On the theoretical side, Allen-Zhu & Li (2020) have studied why deep ensembles outperform individual models in terms of accuracy. Other works studied post-processing methods of calibration (Kumar et al., 2019), established relationships to confidence intervals (Gupta et al., 2020), and derived upper bounds on calibration error either in terms of sample complexity or in terms of the accuracy (Bai et al., 2021; Ji et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2019; Jung et al., 2020; Shabat et al., 2020).

The discussion in our paper complements the above works in multiple ways. First, most works within the machine learning literature focus on top-class calibration, which is concerned only with the confidence level of the top predicted class for each point. The theory in our work, however, requires looking at the confidence level of the model aggregated over all the classes. We then empirically show that SGD ensembles are well-calibrated even in this class-aggregated sense. Furthermore, we carefully investigate what sources of stochasticity result in well-calibrated ensembles. Finally, we provide an exact formal relationship between generalization and calibration via the notion of disagreement, which is fundamentally different from existing theoretical calibration bounds.

Empirical phenomena in deep learning. Broadly, our work falls in the area of research on identifying & understanding empirical phenomena in deep learning (Sedghi et al., 2019), especially in the context of overparameterized models that interpolate. Some example phenomena include the generalization puzzle (Zhang et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2014), double descent (Belkin et al., 2019; Nakkiran et al., 2020), and simplicity bias (Kalimeris et al., 2019; Arpit et al., 2017).

As stated earlier, we build on N&B'20's empirical observation of the Generalization Disagreement Equality (GDE) in pairs of models trained on independently drawn datasets. Here we provide a detailed discussion of how our results are distinct from and/or complement their other relevant findings. First, N&B'20 provide a proof of GDE specific to 1-Nearest Neighbor models trained on two independent datasets. Our result does not restrict the hypothesis class, the algorithm or its stochasticity. Second, N&B'20 identify a notion they term as "feature calibration" which can be thought of as a generalized version of calibration. However, the instantiations of feature calibration that they empirically study are significantly different from the standard notion we study. Furthermore, they treat GDE and feature calibration as independent phenomena. Conversely, we show that calibration in the standard sense implies GDE. Finally, in their Appendix D.7.1, N&B'20 do report studies of ensembles where the members are trained on the same data. But this is in an altogether independent context — the GDE-related experiments in N&B'20 are all reported only on ensembles of members trained on different data. Hence, overall, their empirical results do not imply our GDE results.

# 3 DISAGREEMENT TRACKS GENERALIZATION ERROR

We demonstrate on various datasets and architectures that the test error can be estimated directly by training two runs of SGD and measuring their disagreement on an unlabeled dataset. Importantly, we show that the disagreement rate can track even minute variations in the test error induced by varying hyperparameters. Remarkably, this estimate does not require an independent labeled dataset.

Notations. Let  $h: \mathcal{X} \to [K]$  denote a hypothesis from a hypothesis space  $\mathcal{H}$ , where  $[K]$  denotes the set of  $K$  labels  $\{0, 1, \ldots, K - 1\}$ . Let  $\mathcal{D}$  be a distribution over  $\mathcal{X} \times [K]$ . We will use  $(X, Y)$  to denote the random variable with the distribution  $\mathcal{D}$ , and  $(x, y)$  to denote specific values it can take. Let  $\mathcal{A}$  be a stochastic training algorithm that induces a distribution  $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$  over hypotheses in  $\mathcal{H}$ . Let  $h, h' \sim \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$  denote random hypotheses output by two independent runs of the training procedure. We note that the stochasticity in  $\mathcal{A}$  could arise from any arbitrary source. This may arise from either the fact that each  $h$  is trained on a random dataset drawn from  $\mathcal{D}$  or even a completely different distribution  $\mathcal{D}'$ . The stochasticity could also arise from merely a different random initialization or data ordering. Next, we denote the test error and disagreement rate for hypotheses  $h, h' \sim \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$  by:

$$
\operatorname {T e s t E r r} _ {\mathcal {D}} (h) \triangleq \mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {D}} [ \mathbb {1} [ h (X) \neq Y ] ] \quad \text {a n d} \quad \operatorname {D i s} _ {\mathcal {D}} (h, h ^ {\prime}) \triangleq \mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {D}} [ \mathbb {1} [ h (X) \neq h ^ {\prime} (X) ] ]. \tag {1}
$$

Let  $\tilde{h}$  denote the "ensemble" corresponding to  $h\sim \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$  . In particular, define

$$
\tilde {h} _ {k} (x) \triangleq \mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {H} _ {\mathcal {A}}} [ \mathbb {1} [ h (x) = k ] ] \tag {2}
$$

to be the probability value (between  $[0,1]$ ) given by the ensemble  $\tilde{h}$  for the  $k^{th}$  class. Note that the output of  $\tilde{h}$  is not a one-hot value based on plurality vote.

Main Experimental Setup. We report our main observations on variants of Residual Networks, convolutional neural networks and fully connected networks trained with Momentum SGD on CIFAR-10/100, and SVHN. Each variation of the ResNet has a unique hyperparameter configuration (See Appendix B.1 for details) and all models are (near) interpolating. For each hyperparameter setting, we train two copies of models which experience two independent draws from one or more sources of stochasticity, namely 1. random initialization (denoted by Init) and/or 2. ordering of a fixed training dataset (Order) and/or 3. different (disjoint) training data (Data). We will use the term Diff to denote whether a source of stochasticity is "on". For example, DiffInit means that the two models have different initializations but see the same data in the same order. In DiffOrder, models share the same initialization and see the same data, but in different orders. In DiffData, the models share the initialization, but see different data. In AllDiff, the two models differ in both data and in initialization<sup>2</sup>. The disagreement rate between a pair of models is computed as the proportion of the test data on which the (one-hot) predictions of the two models do not match.

Observations. We illustrate test error  $(y)$  vs disagreement error  $(x)$  scatter plots for CIFAR-10, SVHN and CIFAR-100 in Figures 1, 2 and 3 respectively (and for CNNs on CIFAR-10 in Fig 10). Naively, we would expect these scatter plots to be arbitrarily distributed anywhere between  $y = 0.5x$  (if the errors of the two models are disjoint) and  $x = 0$  (if the errors are identical). However, in all these scatter plots, we observe that test error and disagreement error lie very close to the diagonal line  $y = x$  across different sources of stochasticity, while only slightly deviating in DiffInit/Order. In particular, in AllDiff and DiffData, the points typically lie between  $y = x$  and  $y = 0.9x$  while in DiffInit and DiffOrder, the disagreement rate drops slightly (since the models are trained on the same data) and so the points typically lie between  $y = x$  and  $y = 1.3x$ . We further quantify correlation via the  $R^2$  coefficient and Kendall's Ranking coefficient (tau) reported on top of each scatter plot. Both metrics range from 0 to 1 with 1 being perfect correlation. Indeed, we observe that these quantities are high in all the settings.

The positive observations about DiffInit and DiffOrder are surprising for two reasons. First, when the second network is trained on the same dataset, we would expect its predictions to be largely aligned with the original network — naturally, the disagreement rate would be negligible, and the equality observed in N&B'20 would no longer hold. Furthermore, since we calculate the disagreement rate without using a fresh labeled dataset, we would expect disagreement to be much less predictive of test error when compared to N&B'20. Our observations defy both these expectations.

There are a few more noteworthy aspects. In the low data regime where the test error is high, we would expect the models to be much less well-behaved. However, consider the CIFAR-100 plots

(Fig 3), and additionally, the plots in Fig 4 where we train on CIFAR-10 with just 2000 training points. In both settings the network suffers an error as high as 0.5 to 0.6. Yet, we observe a behavior similar to the other settings (albeit with some deviations) — the scatter plot lies in  $y = (1 \pm 0.1)x$  (for AllDiff and DiffData) and in  $y = (1 \pm 0.3)x$  (for DiffInit/Order), and the correlation metrics are high. Similar results were established in N&B'20 for AllDiff and DiffData.

Finally, it is important to highlight that each scatter plot here corresponds to varying certain hyperparameters that cause only mild variations in the test error. Yet, the disagreement rate is able to capture those variations in the test error. This is a stronger version of the finding in N&B'20 that disagreement captures larger variations under varying dataset size.

Effect of distribution shift and pre-training We study these observations in the context of the PACS dataset, a popular domain generalization benchmark with four distinct distributions, Photo (P in short), Art (A), Cartoon (C) and Sketch (S). All domains share the same seven classes. On any given domain, we train pairs of ResNet50 models (where both models are either randomly initialized or ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) pre-trained) and then evaluate their test error and disagreement on all the four domains. As we see in Fig 5, the surprising phenomenon here is that there are many pairs of source-target domains where GDE is approximately satisfied despite the distribution shift. Notably, for pre-trained models, with the exception of three pairs of source-target domains (namely,  $(\mathsf{P},\mathsf{C})$ ,  $(\mathsf{P},\mathsf{S})$ ,  $(\mathsf{S},\mathsf{P}))$ , GDE is satisfied approximately. The other notable observation is that under distribution shift, pre-trained models can satisfy GDE, and often better than randomly initialized models. This is counter-intuitive, since we would expect pre-trained models to be strongly predisposed towards specific kinds of features, resulting in models that disagree rarely. See Appendix B.1 for hyperparameter details.

# 4 CALIBRATION IMPLIES THE GDE

We now formalize our main observation. In particular, we define "the Generalization Disagreement Equality" as the phenomenon that the test error equals the disagreement rate in expectation over  $h \sim \mathcal{H}_A$ . This was formalized with slight differences as the Agreement Property in N&B'20.

Definition 4.1. The stochastic learning algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  satisfies the Generalization Disagreement Equality (GDE) on the distribution  $\mathcal{D}$  if,

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {h, h ^ {\prime} \sim \mathcal {H} _ {A}} [ \operatorname {D i s} _ {\mathcal {D}} (h, h ^ {\prime}) ] = \mathbb {E} _ {h \sim \mathcal {H} _ {A}} [ \operatorname {T e s t E r r} _ {\mathcal {D}} (h) ]. \tag {3}
$$

Note that the definition does not imply that the equality holds for each pair of  $h, h'$  (which we observed empirically). However, for simplicity, we will stick to the above "equality in expectation" as it captures the essence of the underlying phenomenon while being easier to analyze. To motivate why proving this equality is non-trivial, let us look at the most natural hypothesis that N&B'20 identify (and rule out). Imagine that all datapoints  $(x, y)$  are one of two types: (a) the datapoint is so "easy" that w.p. 1 over  $h \sim \mathcal{H}_A$ ,  $h(x) = y$  (b) the datapoint is so "hard" that  $h(x)$  corresponds to picking a label uniformly at random. In such a case, with a simple calculation, one can see that the above equality would hold not just in expectation over  $\mathcal{D}$ , but even point-wise: for each  $x$ , the disagreement on  $x$  in expectation over  $\mathcal{H}_A$  would equal the error on  $x$  in expectation over  $\mathcal{H}_A$  (namely  $1/2$  if  $x$  is hard, and 0 if easy). Unfortunately, N&B'20 show that in practice, a significant

fraction of the points have disagreement larger than error and another fraction have error larger than disagreement (see Appendix C.4). Surprisingly though, there is a delicate balance between these two types of points such that overall these disparities cancel each other out giving rise to the GDE.

What could create this delicate balance? We identify that this can arise from the fact that the ensemble  $\tilde{h}$  is well-calibrated. Informally, a well-calibrated model is one whose output probability for a particular class (i.e., the model's "confidence") is indicative of the probability that the ground truth class is indeed that class (i.e., the model's "accuracy"). There are many ways in which calibration can be formalized. Below, we provide a particular formalism called class-wise calibration.

Definition 4.2. The ensemble model  $\tilde{h}$  satisfies class-wise calibration on  $\mathcal{D}$  if for any confidence value  $q\in [0,1]$  and for any class  $k\in [K]$ ,

$$
p (Y = k \mid \tilde {h} _ {k} (X) = q) = q. \tag {4}
$$

Next, we show that if the ensemble is class-wise calibrated on the distribution  $\mathcal{D}$ , then GDE does hold on  $\mathcal{D}$ . Note however that shortly we show a more general result where even a weaker notion of calibration is sufficient to prove GDE. But since this stronger notion of calibration is easier to understand, and the proof sketch for this captures the key intuition of the general case, we will focus on this first in detail. It is worth emphasizing that besides requiring well-calibration on the (test) distribution, all our theoretical results are general. We do not restrict the hypothesis class (it need not necessarily be neural networks), or the test/training distribution (they can be different), or where the stochasticity comes from (it need not necessarily come from the random seed or the data).

Theorem 4.1. Given a stochastic learning algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ , if its corresponding ensemble  $\tilde{h}$  satisfies class-wise calibration on  $\mathcal{D}$ , then  $\mathcal{A}$  satisfies the Generalization Disagreement Equality on  $\mathcal{D}$ .

Proof. (Proof sketch for binary classification. Details for full multi-class classification are deferred to Appendix A.2.) Let  $\mathcal{D}_q$  correspond to a "confidence level set" of the ensemble, in that it is the distribution of  $X$  conditioned on  $\tilde{h}_0(X) = q$ . Our key idea is to show that for a class-wise calibrated model, GDE holds within each confidence level set i.e., for each  $q \in [0,1]$ , the (expected) disagreement rate equals test error on  $\mathcal{D}_q$ . Since  $\mathcal{D}$  is a combination of these level sets, it automatically follows that GDE holds over  $\mathcal{D}$ . It is worth contrasting this proof idea with the easy-hard explanation which requires showing that GDE holds point-wise, rather than confidence-level-set-wise.

Now, let us calculate the disagreement on  $\mathcal{D}_q$ . For any fixed  $x$  in the support of  $\mathcal{D}_q$ , the disagreement rate in expectation over  $h$ ,  $h' \sim \mathcal{H}_A$  corresponds to  $q(1 - q) + (1 - q)q = 2q(1 - q)$ . This is simply the probability of the event that  $h$  predicts 0 and  $h'$  predicts 1 summed with the probability that the both predictions are reversed. Next, we calculate the expected error of  $h \sim \mathcal{H}_A$  on  $\mathcal{D}_q$ . At any  $x$ , the expected error equals  $\tilde{h}_{1 - y}(x)$ . From calibration, we have that exactly  $q$  fraction of  $\mathcal{D}_q$  has the true label 0. On these points, the error rate is  $\tilde{h}_1(x) = 1 - q$ . On the remaining  $1 - q$  fraction of  $\mathcal{D}_q$ , the true label is 1, and hence the error rate on those is  $\tilde{h}_0(x) = q$ . The total error rate across both the class 0 and class 1 points is therefore  $q(1 - q) + (1 - q)q = 2q(1 - q)$ .

Remark. In hindsight, intuitively, it may seem natural that calibration allows us to predict the test performance without using labeled test data: a calibrated ensemble already "knows" how much error it commits in different parts of an unlabeled test distribution. However, it is particularly surprising that in practice, GDE holds even without the expectation over  $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}}$ . Because of this, we were able to predict the test performance with only two models rather than an ensemble of many models, even though an ensemble of one or two models is actually not well-calibrated. This observation suggests that the variance of the disagreement and test error (over the stochasticity of  $\mathcal{H}_A$ ) must be unusually small; indeed, we will see later in Table 1 that the variance is very small in practice. In Corollary A.1.1, we present some preliminary theoretical discussion on why the variance could be small.

# 4.1 A MORE GENERAL RESULT: CLASS-WISE TO CLASS-AGGREGATED CALIBRATION

We will now show that GDE holds under a more relaxed notion of calibration, which holds "on average" over the classes rather than individually for each class. Indeed, we demonstrate in a later section (see Appendix C.7) that this averaged notion of calibration holds more gracefully than class-wise

calibration in practice. Recall that in class-wise calibration we look at the conditional probability  $p(Y = k|\tilde{h}_k(X) = q)$  for each  $k$ . Here, we will take an average of these conditional probabilities by weighting the  $k^{th}$  probability by  $p(\tilde{h}_k(X) = q)$ . The result is the following definition:

Definition 4.3. The ensemble  $\tilde{h}$  satisfies class-aggregated calibration on  $\mathcal{D}$  if for each  $q\in [0,1]$

$$
\frac {\sum_ {k = 0} ^ {K - 1} p (Y = k , \tilde {h} _ {k} (X) = q)}{\sum_ {k = 0} ^ {K - 1} p (\tilde {h} _ {k} (X) = q)} = q. \tag {5}
$$

Intuitively, the denominator here corresponds to the points where some class gets confidence value  $q$ ; the numerator corresponds to the points where some class gets confidence value  $q$  and that class also happens to be the ground truth. Note however both the proportions involve counting a point  $x$  multiple times if  $\tilde{h}_k(x) = q$  for multiple classes  $k$ . In Appendix A.5, we discuss the relation between this new notion of calibration to existing definitions. In Appendix A.1 Theorem A.1, we show that the above weaker notion of calibration is sufficient to show GDE. Note that the proof of this is a nontrivial generalization of the argument in the proof sketch of Theorem 4.1, and Theorem 4.1 follows as a straightforward corollary since class-wise calibration implies class-aggregated calibration.

Deviation from calibration. For generality, we would like to consider ensembles that do not satisfy class-aggregated calibration precisely. How much can a deviation from calibration hurt GDE? To answer this question, we quantify calibration error as follows:

Definition 4.4. The Class Aggregated Calibration Error (CACE) of an ensemble  $\tilde{h}$  on  $\mathcal{D}$  is

$$
\operatorname {C A C E} _ {\mathcal {D}} (\tilde {h}) \triangleq \int_ {q \in [ 0, 1 ]} \left| \frac {\sum_ {k} p (Y = k , \tilde {h} _ {k} (X) = q)}{\sum_ {k} p (\tilde {h} _ {k} (X) = q)} - q \right| \cdot \sum_ {k} p (\tilde {h} _ {k} (X) = q) d q. \tag {6}
$$

In other words, for each confidence value  $q$ , we look at the absolute difference between the left and right hand sides of Definition 4.3, and then weight the difference by the proportion of instances where a confidence value of  $q$  is achieved. It is worth keeping in mind that, while the absolute difference term lies in [0, 1], the weight terms alone would integrate to a value of  $K$ . Therefore,  $\mathrm{CACE}_{\mathcal{D}}(\tilde{h})$  can lie anywhere in the range  $[0, K]$ . Note that CACE is different from the "expected calibration error (ECE)" (Naeini et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2017) commonly used in the machine learning literature, which applies only to top-class calibration.

We show below that GDE holds approximately when the calibration error is low (and naturally, as a special case, holds perfectly when calibration error is zero). The proof is deferred to Appendix A.3.

Theorem 4.2. For any stochastic learning algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ :

$$
\left| \mathbb {E} _ {h, h ^ {\prime} \sim \mathcal {H} _ {A}} \left[ \operatorname {D i s} _ {\mathcal {D}} (h, h ^ {\prime}) \right] - \mathbb {E} _ {h \sim \mathcal {H} _ {A}} \left[ \operatorname {T e s t E r r} _ {\mathcal {D}} (h) \right] \right| \leq C A C E _ {\mathcal {D}} (\tilde {h}).
$$

Remark. All our results hold more generally for any probabilistic classifier  $\tilde{h}$  that is not necessarily an ensemble. For example, if  $\tilde{h}$  was an individual neural network whose predictions are given by softmax probabilities, and if those softmax predictions are well-calibrated, then one can state that GDE holds for the neural network itself, i.e., the disagreement rate between two independently sampled one-hot predictions from that network would equal the test error of the softmax predictions.

# 5 EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF CLASS-AGGREGATED CALIBRATION

Empirical evidence for theory. As stated in the introduction, it is a well-established observation that ensembles of SGD trained models provide good confidence estimates (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). However, typically the output of these ensembles correspond to the average softmax probabilities of the individual models, rather than an average of the top-class predictions. Our theory is however based upon the latter type of ensembles. Furthermore, there exists many different evaluation metrics for calibration in literature, while we are particularly interested in the precise definition we have in Definition 4.3. We report our observations keeping these considerations in mind.

In Figure 6, 7 and 8, we show that SGD ensembles do nearly satisfy class-aggregated calibration for all the sources of stochasticity we have considered. In each plot, we report the conditional

probability in the L.H.S of Definition 4.3 along the  $y$  axis and the confidence value  $q$  along the  $x$  axis. We observe that the plot closely follows the  $x = y$  line. In fact, we observe that calibration holds across different sources of stochasticity. We discuss this aspect in more detail in Appendix A.6.

For a more precise quantification of how well calibration captures GDE, we also look at our notion of calibration error, namely CACE, which also acts as an upper bound on the difference between the test error and the disagreement rate. We report CACE averaged over 100 models in Table 1 (for CIFAR-10) and Table 3 (for CIFAR-100). Most importantly, we observe that the CACE across different stochasticity settings correlates with the actual gap between the test error and the disagreement rate. In particular, CACE for AllDiff/DiffData are about 2 to 3 times smaller than that for DiffInit/Order, paralleling the behavior of |TestErr - Dis| in these settings.

Caveats. While we believe our work provides a simple theoretical insight into how calibration leads to GDE, there are a few gaps that we do not address. First, we do not provide a theoretical characterization of when we can expect good calibration (and hence, when we can expect GDE to hold). Next, our theory and the supporting experiments shed insight into why GDE holds in expectation over training stochasticity. However, it is surprising that in practice the disagreement rate (and the test error) for a single pair of models lies close to this expectation. This occurs even though two-model-ensembles are poorly calibrated (see Tables 1 and 3). Finally, while CACE is an upper bound on the deviation from GDE, in practice CACE is only a loose bound, which could either imply a mere lack of data/models or perhaps that our theory can be further refined.

# 6 CONCLUSION

Building on Nakkiran & Bansal (2020), we observe that remarkably, two networks trained on the same dataset, tend to disagree with each other on unlabeled data nearly as much as they disagree with the ground truth. We've also theoretically shown that this property arises from the fact that SGD ensembles are well-calibrated. Broadly, these findings contribute to the larger pursuit of identifying and understanding empirical phenomena in deep learning. Future work could shed light on why different sources of stochasticity surprisingly have a similar effect on calibration. It is also important for future work in uncertainty estimation and calibration to develop a precise and exhaustive characterization of when calibration and GDE would hold. On a different note, we hope our work inspires other novel ways to leverage unlabeled data to estimate generalization and also further cross-pollination of ideas between research in generalization and calibration.
