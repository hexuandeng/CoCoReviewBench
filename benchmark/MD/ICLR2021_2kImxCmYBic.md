# A NUMBERS GAME: NUMERIC ENCODING OPTIONS WITH AUTOMUNGE

Anonymous authors

Paper under double-blind review

# ABSTRACT

Mainstream practice in machine learning with tabular data may take for granted that any feature engineering beyond scaling for numeric sets is superfluous in context of deep neural networks. This paper will offer arguments for potential benefits of extended encodings of numeric streams in deep learning by way of a survey of options for numeric transformations as available in the Automunge open source python library platform for tabular data pipelines, where transformations may be applied to distinct columns in "family tree" sets with generations and branches of derivations. Automunge transformation options include normalization, binning, noise injection, derivatives, and more. The aggregation of these methods into family tree sets of transformations are demonstrated for use to present numeric features to machine learning in multiple configurations of varying information content, as may be applied to encode numeric sets of unknown interpretation.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Of the various modalities of applications of machine learning (such as images, language, audio, etc.) tabular data, aka structured data, as may comprise tables of feature set columns and collected sample rows, in my experience does not command as much attention from the research community, for which I speculate may be partly attributed to the general non-uniformity across manifestations precluding the conventions of most other modalities for representative benchmarks and availability of pre-trained architectures as could be adapted with fine-tuning to practical applications. That is not to say that tabular data lacks points of uniformity across data sets, for at its core the various feature sets can at a high level be grouped into just two primary types: numeric and categoric. It was the focus of a recent paper by this author (Author, 2020) to explore methods of preparing categoric sets for machine learning as are available in the Automunge open source python library platform for tabular data pipelines. This paper will give similar treatment for methods to prepare numeric feature sets for machine learning.

Of course it would be an oversimplification to characterize "numeric feature sets" as a sufficient descriptor alone to represent the wide amount of diversity as may be found between different such instances. Numeric could be referring to integers, floats, or combinations thereof. The set of entries could be bounded, the potential range of entries could be bounded on the left, right, or both sides, the distribution of values could be thin or fat tailed, single or multi-modal. The order of samples could be independent or sequential. In some cases the values could themselves be an encoded representation of a categoric feature.

Beyond the potential diversity found within our numeric features, another source of diversity could be considered based on relationships between multiple feature sets. For example one feature could be independent of the others, could contain full or partial redundancy with one or more other variables such as by correlation, or in the case of sequential data there could even be causal relationships between variables across time steps.

The primary focus of transformations to be discussed in this paper will not take into account variable interdependencies, and will instead operate under the assumption that the training operation of a downstream learning algorithm may be more suitable for the efficient interpretation of such interdependencies, as the convention for Automunge is that data transformations (and in some cases sets of transformations) are to be directed for application to a distinct feature set as input. In many cases the basis for these transformations will be properties derived from the received feature in a

designated "train" set (as may be passed to the automunge(. function) for subsequent application on a consistent basis to a designated "test" set (as may be passed to the postmunge(. function).

# 2 NORMALIZATIONS

A common practice for preprocessing numeric feature sets for the application of neural networks is to apply a normalization operation in which received values are centered and scaled based on properties of the data. By conversion to comparable scale between features, backpropagation may have an easier time navigating the fitness landscape rather than weighting to higher magnitude inputs (Ng, 2011). Table 1 surveys a few normalization operations as available in Automunge.

Table 1: Normalizations  

<table><tr><td>Type</td><td>ID</td><td>Formula</td><td>Scaling</td></tr><tr><td>z-score</td><td>&#x27;nmbr&#x27;</td><td>(xi - μ)/σ</td><td>scaled to sigma 1 and mu 0</td></tr><tr><td>min-max</td><td>&#x27;mnmx&#x27;</td><td>(xi - min)/(max - min)</td><td>scaled to unit interval</td></tr><tr><td>mean</td><td>&#x27;mean&#x27;</td><td>(xi - mean)/(max - min)</td><td>scaled and centered to mean</td></tr><tr><td>MAD</td><td>&#x27;MAD3&#x27;</td><td>(xi - max)/(MAD)</td><td>scaled by median absolute deviation</td></tr><tr><td>lognorm</td><td>&#x27;lgnm&#x27;</td><td>ln(xi) → (xi - μ)/σ</td><td>log-normal scaled to Gaussian</td></tr></table>

Upon inspection a few points of differentiation become evident. The choice of denominator can be material to the result, for while both (max - min) and standard deviation can have the result of shrinking or enlarging the values to fall within a more uniform range, the (max - min) variety has more of a known returned range for the output that is independent of the feature set distribution properties, thus allowing us to ensure all of the min-max returned values are non-negative for instance, as may be a pre-requisite for some kinds of algorithms for classical or quantum computation. Of course this known range of output relies on the assumption that the range of values in subsequent test sets will correspond to the train set properties that serve as a basis - to allow a user to prevent these type of outliers from interfering with downstream applications, Automunge allows a user to pass parameters to the transformation functions, such as to activate floors or caps on the returned range.

An easy to overlook outcome of the shifting and/or centering of the returned range by way of the subtraction operation in the numerator is a loss of the original zero point, as for example with z-score normalization the returned zero point is shifted to coincide with the original mean. It is the opinion of this author that such re-centering of the data may not always be a trivial trade-off. Consider the special properties of the number 0 in mathematics, such as multiplicative properties at, above, or below. By shifting the original zero point we are presenting a (small) obstacle to the training operation in order to relearn this point. Perhaps more importantly, further trade-offs include the interpretability of the returned data.

Automunge thus offers a novel form of normalization, available in our library as 'retn' (standing for "retain"), that bases the formula applied to scale data on the range of values found within the train set, with the result of scaling the data within a similar range as some of those demonstrated above while also retaining the zero point and thus the  $+/-$  sign of all received data.

Table 2: Retain Normalization ('retn')  

<table><tr><td>Min</td><td>Max</td><td>Formula</td><td>Returned Min</td><td>Returned Max</td></tr><tr><td>≤ 0</td><td>≥ 0</td><td>xi/(max - min)</td><td>min/(max - min)</td><td>max/(max - min)</td></tr><tr><td>&gt; 0</td><td>&gt; 0</td><td>(xi - min)/(max - min)</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>&lt; 0</td><td>&lt; 0</td><td>(xi - max)/(max - min)</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

# 3 TRANSFORMATIONS

In many cases the application of a normalization procedure may be preceded by one or more types of data transformations applied to the received numeric set. Examples of data transformations could include basic mathematic operators like  $+ - * /$ , log transforms, raising to a power, absolute values, etc. In some cases the transformations may also be tailored to the properties of the train set, such as for example with a Box-Cox power law transformation (Box & Cox, 1964).

In the Automunge library, the order of such sets of transformations, as may be applied to a distinct source column, and in some cases which may include generations and branches of derivations, are specified by way of transformation category entries to a set of "family tree" primitives (Author, 2020) for a root transformation category, and where a transformation category entry may be associated with one or more transformation functions intended for application to corresponding train and/or test set feature columns, potentially including custom defined transformation functions with minimal requirements of simple data structures. Such root categories may be pre-defined in the Automunge library of transformations or may be custom configured by a user in entries to a "transformdict" data structure.

Table 3: Family Tree Primitives  

<table><tr><td>Primitive</td><td>Upstream / Downstream</td><td>Applied to Generation</td><td>Column Action</td><td>Downstream Offspring</td></tr><tr><td>parents</td><td>upstream</td><td>first</td><td>replace</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>siblings</td><td>upstream</td><td>first</td><td>supplement</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>auntsuncles</td><td>upstream</td><td>first</td><td>replace</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>cousins</td><td>upstream</td><td>first</td><td>supplement</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>children</td><td>downstream parents</td><td>offspring</td><td>replace</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>niecesnephews</td><td>downstream siblings</td><td>offspring</td><td>supplement</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>coworkers</td><td>downstream auntsuncles</td><td>offspring</td><td>replace</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>friends</td><td>downstream cousins</td><td>offspring</td><td>supplement</td><td>no</td></tr></table>

The convention for transformation functions in the Automunge library is that any kind of function accepts any kind of data, and in cases where an invalid entry is returned, such as for example when dividing by zero, or taking a square root of a negative number, such entry may serve as a target for missing data infill, such as infill methods that may be applied to a column from a library of infill options - including "ML infill" in which random forest models (Breiman, 2001) are used to predict infill based on properties of the train set. To facilitate the application of infill, transformation categories used as root categories are specified with a classification for the types of data that will be considered valid input, as for example may be non-negative numeric, non-zero numeric, integer numeric, etc., with such classification populated in the same "processdict" data structure used to assign transformation functions to a transformation category.

# 4 BINS AND GRAININGS

In most cases the transformations considered in the preceding section maintained full information retention of the received data, such that with returned sets the form of the input data can be recovered with an inversion operation (as is available in the Automunge library). For binning transformations, there may instead be a type of coarse graining of the feature set, such as to aggregate buckets of entries into a categoric representation. Automunge offers a wide range of options for numeric binning [Table 4]. Bins may be aggregated to either supplement or replace received numeric sets.

For each binning operation, options are available to return the categoric encoding as a one-hot encoding, ordinal integer encoding, or binary encoding in which distinct categories may be represented by multiple simultaneous activations. This is partly motivated by different conventions of various libraries for accepting input to an entity embedding layer (Guo & Berkhahn, 2016) as may be applied to the returned categoric encoding in a downstream training operation.

# 5 NOISE INJECTION

For most cases in the Automunge library, transformations applied to a train set feature set are applied to the corresponding test set feature set using the same basis, such that if the same data is received for both train and test sets, the same form will be returned (a useful point for validations). The noise injection options are a little different in that such injections may be intended just for the train data but not the corresponding test data.

The rationale behind including options for noise injection were first to support differential privacy considerations (Dwork et al., 2006). Other potential uses of noise injections could be to perturb the model training such as to facilitate diversity between models as may be beneficial in the aggregation of ensembles (Dietterich, 2000) or as a source of training data augmentation.

The options available for noise injection are generally applied as distinct transformation category entries to family tree primitives, such as may be applied downstream to a normalization or categoric encoding. (The convention for transformation functions is that they receive input of a single target column, so transformations performed downstream of a categoric encoding should be fed an ordinal input.) The library includes distinct noise injection family tree aggregations tailored to operation of several different types of received normalizations, such as may rely on a known range or scale of input, or applied preceding different types of categoric encodings.

Figure 2: 'DP10' family trees

Numeric noise injections [Table 5] are derived from a Gaussian source with configurable parameters. For noise intended to sets with a fixed range of values such as DPmm, although the noise source as implemented is Gaussian, the application is capped from extreme outliers at half of range (e.g.  $+/-0.5$ ) and based on whether an input entry is above or below the midpoint, positive or negative noise respectively is scaled to ensure maintained original range in returned data based on values of input entry. Parameters are also accepted to indicate what ratio of input will receive injection. Similar options are available for Laplace distribution noise profiles.

The application of noise to categoric encodings [Table 6] is a little simpler, where a given ratio of input entries are flipped to one of the other encodings between which have a uniform probability (including possibility of original entry retention).

# 6 SEQUENTIAL DATA

For numeric features in which the order of samples carry some significance, e.g. for time series data, some additional options are available to extract structure from relationships between time steps (these methods may benefit from a convention that time deltas between measurements are at or nearly constant). The theory is that for sequential machine learning applications, such as may make use of recurrence, convolution, or attention mechanisms, there may be benefit to supplementing feature streams with properties carried forward from prior time steps, where this type of operation may be particularly beneficial when there is some known cyclic property inherent in the application, such as e.g. scheduled trading hours or quarterly reports.

Included in the Automunge library are sequential transforms to supplement sequential streams with proxies for derivatives by returning deltas between an entry and some desired time step prior by way of the 'dxdt' family of transforms. Such application may be applied once as a proxy for velocity, and may also be run multiple times upon that output as proxies for higher order derivatives. A variant on this operation may, instead of taking point-wise deltas, return deltas between averages of sets of points, such as to smooth or de-noise the data. The outputs of these operations may each be normalized such as with the 'retn' normalization for sign retention.

# 7 INTEGER SETS

Integer feature sets of unknown origin may present a particular challenge for automated encodings, as these may be associated with a diverse set of interpretations, such as may originate from continuous variables, counters, discrete relational variables (e.g. small/medium/large), or possibly even an ordinal categoric encoding (Stevens et al., 2020). The Automunge philosophy for these kind of ambiguities is to simply redundantly encode in a manner suitable for each [Table 7], such as to defer to a training operation for determining relevancy.

# 8 EXPERIMENTS

Some experiments were run to evaluate impact of various normalizations and transformations. The Higgs data set (Baldi et al., 2014) was selected based on scale and predominantly numeric feature types. The Higgs application is tabular data for binary classification sourced from high energy physics domain to evaluate subatomic particle interactions such as to distinguish between background noise and traces of Higgs boson interactions. The origin paper noted some details of architectures (5 layers with 300 nodes in each) that served as basis for the experiments, similarly with the  $500\mathrm{k}$  size for the validation set out of 8.8M samples. A departure was made from the origin paper in use of a phased learning rate with the fastai (Howard & Gugger, 2020) "fit_one_cycle" learner for tabular data, partly for convenience along with time and resource constraints. Since the interest was primarily to evaluate relative performance between different preprocessing methods, no significant attempt was made to train models to maximum performance or to venture beyond double descent, instead the primary tuning aspect was selecting an epoch depth beyond which additional did not have improved validation metrics. The experiments were repeated with different size subsets of the training data, including full data set,  $5\%$  samples, and  $0.25\%$  samples to represent scenarios with underserved training data. Learning rates deferred to the fastai default finder, and the evaluation metric was selected as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) to be consistent with the origin demonstration.

The experiments applied Automunge to preprocess the feature sets, in each case applying uniform transformation types between features although with basis fit to properties of each respective column, and with missing data infill by way of the Automunge adjacent cell infill option. The types of transformations were selected to demonstrate impact of a few representative variants noted in this writeup, and included a base scenario with no feature scaling applied (just raw numeric data), along with a scenario for z-score normalization, retain normalization, retain normalization supplemented by standard deviation bins, and finally two scenarios of retain normalization with noise injection (with noise injected to full feature sets or to a subset of the feature sets). Both of the noise injections applied Gaussian noise with standard deviation of 0.03 and with scaling to maintain the fixed range of the received data. The full noise injections refers to having noise applied to all entries and the partial noise injection refers to application to a  $3\%$  ratio of randomly selected entries in each feature.

The findings of the experiments are summarized in Tables 8 by way of reporting the final validation set metrics and performance delta from the raw data scenario. The AUC metric shown compares to the origin paper's reported  $88\%$ , which was based on a reported 200-1,000 epochs compared to this

experiment's 1-28 so there is some dissimilarity in results, which can also partly be attributed to the phased learning rate schedule applied by fastai. The AUC metrics shown are averages of three trials.

The scenarios for raw data, z-score, and retain achieved similar results. Although, as consistent with expectations, the metrics for normalized data were slightly better than raw on average, it is not clear if they were sufficiently statistically significant to draw firm conclusions. Part of the impact of supplementing the normalized data with standard deviation bins was a small increase of training time. As expected the noise injection had a dampening effect on the model accuracy, although the partial injection had only a small penalty in comparison to the retain normalization without injection.

The experiment with the full data set was repeated to demonstrate impact to a linear model:

# 9 DISCUSSION

I would offer first that any consideration around benefits of feature engineering should distinguish first by scale of data available for training. When approaching big data scale input with infinite computational resources there may be less of a case to be made for much beyond basic normalized input. The nuance comes into play when we are targeting applications with real world constraints. Although deep over-parameterized models may still be applied to target applications with underrepresented data (Olson et al., 2018), such methods carry overheads. It is one of the premises of the Automunge library that supplementing our data streams with redundant features in multiple configurations may lower the bar to efficient extraction of inter-variable relationships.

My experience is that the machine learning community has by large become somewhat dismissive of any kind of feature engineering, I expect partly owed to such works as Deep Learning (Goodfellow et al., 2016) which offers that deep learning has supplanted the need for such effort. I would offer in retort that there are different kinds of feature engineering to consider. Those methods as may apply explorations and optimizations between inter-variable relationships I agree are largely redundant of what may be efficiently derived through backpropagation and this is part of the reason why Automunge hasn't ventured into this territory. But the types of data manipulations as may be used to supplement numeric features with multiple configurations are computationally efficient, and need not require sophisticated optimizations to apply. The primary cost of such supplements are the memory overheads as the data set size is expanded.

Further, variations on feature composition, such as by variations in information content and variations on injected noise, may serve as a useful source of model perturbations in ensemble assemblies. Noise injection may be of benefit for anonymizing sensitive data for purposes of differential privacy, and may also serve as a source of training data augmentation, similar to how for convolutional networks training data images may be duplicated with artificial variations (Perez & Wang, 2017).

I'll close by noting an interesting paper I saw at NeurIPS last year, "SGD on Neural Networks Learn Functions of Increasing Complexity" by Nakkiran et al. (2019), in which the authors found that SGD behaves as a linear model in early epochs, and importantly that characteristics of such linear models are retained even in the later stages of training. Put differently, any steps that may be made to ensure that our models may efficiently extract properties even in early stages, before deep learning can do its magic, are not immaterial to the final performance.
