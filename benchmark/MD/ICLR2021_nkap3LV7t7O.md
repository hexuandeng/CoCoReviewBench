# ABSTRACT

Variational autoencoders (VAEs) provide an effective and simple method for modeling complex distributions. However, training VAEs often requires considerable hyperparameter tuning to determine the optimal amount of information retained by the latent variable. We study the impact of calibrated decoders, which learn the uncertainty of the decoding distribution and can determine this amount of information automatically, on the VAE performance. While many methods for learning calibrated decoders have been proposed, many of the recent papers that employ VAEs rely on heuristic hyperparameters and ad-hoc modifications instead. We perform the first comprehensive comparative analysis of calibrated decoder and provide recommendations for simple and effective VAE training. Our analysis covers a range of datasets and several single-image and sequential VAE models. We further propose a simple but novel modification to the commonly used Gaussian decoder, which computes the prediction variance analytically. We observe empirically that using heuristic modifications is not necessary with our method.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep density models based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) have found ubiquitous use in probabilistic modeling and representation learning as they are both conceptually simple and are able to scale to very complex distributions and large datasets. These VAE techniques are used for tasks such as future frame prediction (Castrejon et al., 2019), image segmentation (Kohl et al., 2018), generating speech (Chung et al., 2015) and music (Dhariwal et al., 2020), as well as model-based reinforcement learning (Hafner et al., 2019a). However, in practice, many of these approaches require careful manual tuning of the balance between two terms that correspond to distortion and rate from information theory (Alemi et al., 2017). This balance trades off fidelity of reconstruction and quality of samples from the model: a model with low rate would not contain enough information to reconstruct the data, while allowing the model to have high rate might lead to unrealistic samples from the prior as the KL-divergence constraint becomes weaker (Alemi et al., 2017; Higgins et al., 2017). While a proper variational lower bound does not expose any free parameters to control this tradeoff, many prior works heuristically introduce a weight on the prior KL-divergence term, often denoted  $\beta$ . Usually,  $\beta$  needs to be tuned for every dataset and model variant as a hyperparameter, which slows down development and can lead to poor performance as finding the optimal value is often prohibitively computationally expensive. Moreover, using  $\beta \neq 1$  precludes the appealing interpretation of the VAE objective as a bound on the data likelihood, and is undesirable for applications like density modeling.

While many architectures for calibrating decoders have been proposed in the literature (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Kingma et al., 2016; Dai & Wipf, 2019), more applied work typically employs VAEs with uncalibrated decoding distributions, such as Gaussian distributions without a learned variance, where the decoder only outputs the mean parameter (Castrejon et al., 2019; Denton & Fergus, 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Babaeizadeh et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Hafner et al., 2019b; Pong et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2017; Pavlakos et al., 2019), or uses other ad-hoc modifications to the objective (Sohn et al., 2015; Henaff et al., 2019). Indeed, it is well known that attempting to learn the variance in a Gaussian decoder may lead to numerical instability (Rezende & Viola, 2018; Dai & Wipf, 2019), and naive approaches often lead to poor results. As a result, it remains unclear whether practical empirical performance of VAEs actually benefits from calibrated decoders or not.

To rectify this, our first contribution is to conduct a comparative analysis of various calibrated decoder architectures and provide recommendations for simple and effective VAE training. We find that, while naive calibrated architectures often lead to worse results, a careful choice of the output distribution can work very well, and removes the need to tune the additional parameter  $\beta$ . Indeed, we note that the entropy of the decoding distribution controls the mutual information  $I(x;z)$ . Calibrated decoders allow the model to control  $I(x;z)$  automatically, instead of relying on manual tuning. Our second contribution is to propose a simple but novel technique for optimizing the decoder variance analytically, without requiring the decoder network to produce it as an additional output. We call the resulting approach to learning the Gaussian variance the  $\sigma$ -VAE. In our experiments, the  $\sigma$ -VAE outperforms the alternative of learning the variance through gradient descent, while being simpler to implement and extend. We validate our results on several VAE and sequence VAE models and a range of image and video datasets.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Prior work on variational autoencoders has studied a number of different decoder parameterizations. Kingma & Welling (2014); Rezende et al. (2014) use the Bernoulli distribution for the binary MNIST data and Kingma & Welling (2014) use Gaussian distributions with learned variance parameter for grayscale images. However, modeling images with continuous distributions is prone to instability as the variance can converge to zero (Rezende & Viola, 2018; Mattei & Frellsen, 2018; Dai & Wipf, 2019). Some work has attempted to rectify this problem by adding uniform noise to ground truth data (Gregor et al., 2016), or optimizing the variance in a two-stage procedure (Arvanitidis et al., 2017). Additionally, different choices for representing such variance exist, including diagonal covariance (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Sønderby et al., 2016; Rolfe, 2016), or a single shared parameter (Kingma et al., 2016; Dai & Wipf, 2019; Edwards & Storkey, 2016; Rezende & Viola, 2018). We analyze these and notice that learning a single variance parameter shared across images leads to numerically stable training and good performance, without resorting to adding noise or even clipping the variance; and further improve the estimation of this variance with an analytic solution.

Early work on discrete VAE decoders for color images modeled them with the Bernoulli distribution, treating the color intensities as probabilities (Gregor et al., 2015). Further work has explored various parameterizations based on discretized continuous distributions, such as discretized logistic (Kingma et al., 2016). More recent work has improved expressivity of the decoder with a mixture of discretized logistics (Chen et al., 2016; Maaloe et al., 2019). However, these models also employ powerful autoregressive decoders (Chen et al., 2016; Gulrajani et al., 2016; Maaloe et al., 2019), and the latent variables in these models may not represent all of the significant factors of variation in the data, as some factors can instead be modeled internally by the autoregressive decoder (Alemi et al., 2017).<sup>1</sup>

While a range of calibrated decoding techniques exist, we observe that, outside the core generative modeling community, uncalibrated decoders are ubiquitous. They are used in work on future frame prediction (Denton & Fergus, 2018; Castrejon et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2018; Babaeizadeh et al., 2018), image segmentation (Kohl et al., 2018), image-to-image translation (Zhu et al., 2017), generating 3D human pose (Pavlakos et al., 2019), as well as model-based reinforcement learning (Henaff et al., 2019; Hafner et al., 2019b;a), and representation learning (Lee et al., 2019; Watter et al., 2015; Pong et al., 2019). The majority of these works utilize the heuristic hyperparameter  $\beta$  instead, which is undesirable both as the resulting objective is no longer a bound on the log-likelihood, and as the hyperparameter  $\beta$  usually requires extensive tuning. In this work, we analyze the common pitfalls of using calibrated decoders that may have prevented the practitioners from using them, propose a simple and effective analytic way of learning such calibrated distribution, and provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation of different decoding distributions.

Alternative discussions of the hyperparameter  $\beta$  are presented by Zhao et al. (2017); Higgins et al. (2017); Alemi et al. (2017); Achille & Soatto (2018), who show that it controls the amount of information in the latent variable,  $I(x;z)$ . Peng et al. (2018); Rezende & Viola (2018) further discuss constrained optimization objectives for VAEs, which also yield a similar hyperparameter. Here, we focus on  $\beta$ -VAEs with Gaussian decoders with constant variance, as commonly used in recent work, and show that the hyperparameter  $\beta$  can be incorporated in the decoding likelihood for these models.

# 3 CALIBRATED DECODING DISTRIBUTIONS

The generative model of a VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) with parameters  $\theta$  is specified with a prior distribution over the latent variable  $p_{\theta}(z)$ , commonly unit Gaussian, and a decoding distribution  $p_{\theta}(x|z)$ , which for color images is commonly a conditional Gaussian parameterized with a neural network. We would like to fit this generative model to a given dataset by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO (Neal & Hinton, 1998; Jordan et al., 1999; Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014)), which uses an approximate posterior distribution  $q_{\phi}(z|x)$ , also commonly a conditional Gaussian specified with a neural network. In this work, we focus on the form of the decoding distribution  $p_{\theta}(x|z)$ . To achieve the best results, we want a decoding distribution that represents the required probability  $p(x|z)$  accurately, that is, we want the decoding distribution to be calibrated in the statistical sense. In this section, we will review and analyze various choices of decoding distributions that enable better decoder calibration, including expressive decoding distributions that can represent both the prediction of the image and the uncertainty about such prediction, or even multimodal predictions.

# 3.1 GAUSSIAN DECODERS

We first analyse the commonly used Gaussian decoders. We note that the commonly used MSE reconstruction loss between the reconstruction  $\hat{x}$  and ground truth data  $x$  is equivalent to the negative log-likelihood objective with a Gaussian decoding distribution with constant variance:

$$
- \ln p (x | z) = \frac {1}{2} | | \hat {x} - x | | ^ {2} + D \ln \sqrt {2 \pi} = \frac {1}{2} | | \hat {x} - x | | ^ {2} + c = \frac {D}{2} \mathbf {M S E} (\hat {x}, x) + c,
$$

where  $p(x|z)\sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{x},I)$ , the prediction  $\hat{x}$  is produced with a neural network  $\hat{x} = \mu_{\theta}(z)$ , and  $D$  is the dimensionality of  $x$ .

This demonstrates a drawback of methods that rely simply on the MSE loss (Castrejon et al., 2019; Denton & Fergus, 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Hafner et al., 2019b; Pong et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2017; Henaff et al., 2019), as it is equivalent to assuming a particular, constant variance of the Gaussian decoding distribution. By learning this variance, we can achieve much better performance due to better calibration of the decoder. There are several ways in which we can specify this variance. An expressive way to specify the variance is to specify a diagonal covariance matrix for the image, with one value per pixel (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Sønderby et al., 2016; Rolfe, 2016). This can be done, for example, by letting a neural network  $\sigma_{\theta}$  output the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix given a latent sample  $z$ :

$$
p _ {\theta} (x \mid z) \sim \mathcal {N} (\mu_ {\theta} (z), \sigma_ {\theta} (z) ^ {2}). \tag {1}
$$

This parameterization of the decoding distribution outputs one variance value per each pixel and channel. While powerful, we observe in Section 5.3 that this approach attains suboptimal performance, and is moreover prone to numerical instability. Instead, we will find experimentally that a simpler parameterization, in which the covariance matrix is specified with a single shared (Kingma et al., 2016; Dai & Wipf, 2019; Edwards & Storkey, 2016; Rezende & Viola, 2018) parameter  $\sigma$  as  $\Sigma = \sigma I$  often works better in practice:

$$
p _ {\theta , \sigma} (x | z) \sim \mathcal {N} (\mu_ {\theta} (z), \sigma^ {2} I). \tag {2}
$$

The parameter  $\sigma$  can be optimized together with parameters of the neural network  $\theta$  with gradient descent. Of particular interest is the interpretation of this parameter. Writing out the expression for the decoding likelihood, we obtain

$$
- \ln p (x | z) = \frac {1}{2 \sigma^ {2}} | | \hat {x} - x | | ^ {2} + D \ln \sigma \sqrt {2 \pi} = \frac {1}{2 \sigma^ {2}} | | \hat {x} - x | | ^ {2} + D \ln \sigma + c = D \ln \sigma + \frac {D}{2 \sigma^ {2}} \mathrm {M S E} (\hat {x}, x) + c.
$$

The full objective of the resulting Gaussian  $\sigma$ -VAE is:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\theta , \phi , \sigma} = D \ln \sigma + \frac {D}{2 \sigma^ {2}} M S E (\hat {x}, x) + D _ {K L} (q (z | x) | | p (z)). \tag {3}
$$

Note that  $\sigma$  may be viewed as a weighting parameter between the MSE reconstruction term and the KL-divergence term in the objective. Moreover, this objective explicitly specifies how to select the optimal variance: the variance should be selected to minimize the (weighted) MSE loss while also minimizing the logarithm of the variance.

Connection to  $\beta$ -VAE. The  $\beta$ -VAE objective (Higgins et al., 2017) for a Gaussian decoder with unit variance is:

$$
\mathcal {L} ^ {\beta} = \frac {D}{2} M S E (\hat {x}, x) + \beta D _ {K L} (q (z | x) \| p (z)). \tag {4}
$$

We see that it can be interpreted as a particular case of the objective (3), where the variance is constant and the term  $D\ln \sigma$  can be ignored during optimization. The  $\beta$ -VAE objective is then equivalent to a  $\sigma$ -VAE with a constant variance  $\sigma = \sqrt{\beta / 2}$  (for a particular learning rate setting). In recent work (Zhu et al., 2017; Denton & Fergus, 2018; Lee et al., 2019),  $\beta$ -VAE models are often used in this exact regime. By tuning the  $\beta$  term, practitioners are able to tune the variance of the decoder, manually producing a more calibrated decoder. As we will show in our experiments, the variance  $\sigma$  can instead simply be learned end-to-end, removing the need to manually select  $\beta$ .

An alternative discussion of this connection in the context of linear VAEs is also presented by Lucas et al. (2019). While the  $\beta$  term is not necessary for good performance if the decoder is calibrated, it can still be employed if desired, such as when the aim is to attain better disentanglement (Higgins et al., 2017) or a particular rate-distortion tradeoff (Alemi et al., 2017). However, we found that with calibrated decoders, the best sample quality is obtained when  $\beta = 1$ .

Loss implementation details. For the correct evidence lower bound computation, it is necessary to add the values of the MSE loss and the KL divergence across the dimensions. We observe that common implementations of these losses (Denton & Fergus, 2018; Abadi et al., 2016; Paszke et al., 2019) use averaging instead, which will lead to poor results if the number of image dimensions is significantly different from the number of the latent dimensions. While this can be conveniently ignored in the  $\beta$ -VAE regime, where the balance term is tuned manually anyway, for the  $\sigma$ -VAE it is essential to compute the objective value correctly.

Variance implementation details. Since the variance is non-negative, we parameterize it logarithmically as  $\sigma^2 = e^{2\lambda}$ , where  $\lambda$  is the logarithm of the standard deviation. For some models, such as per-pixel variance decoders, we observed that it is necessary to restrict the variance range for numerical stability. We do so by using the soft clipping operations proposed by Chua et al. (2018):

$$
\lambda := \lambda_ {\max } - \operatorname {s o f t p l u s} \left(\lambda_ {\max } - \lambda\right); \quad \lambda := \lambda_ {\min } + \operatorname {s o f t p l u s} \left(\lambda - \lambda_ {\min }\right).
$$

We observe that setting  $\lambda_{\mathrm{min}} = -6$  to lower bound the standard deviation to be at least half of the distance between allowed color values works well in practice. We also observe that this clipping is unnecessary when learning a shared  $\sigma$  value.

# 3.2 DISCRETE DECODERS

It is possible to use discrete decoding distributions to generate images, as color values are commonly restricted to a fixed set of integer pixel intensities (e.g. 0..255). In the most general case, a discrete decoding distribution factorized per each pixel and channel would be specified by a probability mass vector  $\hat{x}$  with 256 entries, one per each possible intensity value, similarly to a per-pixel classifier of the intensity value. We can implement it with a soft-max layer, yielding the following log-likelihood loss (sometimes called the cross-entropy loss) for a true pixel with intensity  $i$ :

$$
- \ln p (x | z) = - \ln \frac {\exp (\hat {x} _ {i})}{\sum_ {j} \exp (\hat {x} _ {j})},
$$

We will evaluate these and further choices of discrete decoders, described in Appendix D.

# 4 OPTIMAL VARIANCE ESTIMATION FOR CALIBRATED GAUSSIAN DECODERS

In this section, we propose a simple but novel analytic way of obtaining a calibrated decoder for continuous distributions that further improves performance. The Gaussian decoders with learned variance described in Section 3.1 are calibrated and work better than naive unit variance decoders. However, for  $\sigma$ -VAE optimized with gradient descent or Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015), we observe that careful learning rate tuning can yield significantly better performance, which is in line with prior work that reported poor performance of gradient descent for optimizing Gaussian distributions

(Amari, 1998; Peters & Schaal, 2008). A smaller learning rate often produces better performance, but slows down the training, as the likelihood values  $p(x|z)$  will be very suboptimal in the beginning. Instead, here we propose an analytic solution for the value of  $\sigma$ , which computes it analytically and does not require gradient descent.

The maximum likelihood estimate of the variance given a known mean is the average squared distance from the mean:

$$
\sigma^ {*} = \underset {\sigma} {\arg \max } \mathcal {N} (x | \mu , \sigma^ {2} I) = \operatorname {M S E} (x, \mu), \tag {5}
$$

where  $\mathrm{MSE}(x,\mu) = \frac{1}{D}\sum_{i}(x_{i} - \mu_{i})^{2}$ . Eq. 5 can be easily shown using manual differentiation, and is a generalization of the fact that the MLE estimate of the variance is the sample variance.

The optimal variance for the decoder distribution under the maximum likelihood criterion is then simply the average MSE loss over the data and the encoder distribution. We leverage this to create an optimal analytic solution for the variance. In the batch setting, the optimal variance would be simply the MSE loss, and can be updated after every gradient update for the other parameters of the decoder. In the mini-batch setting, we use a batchwise estimate of the variance computed for the current minibatch. We analyze these approximations in Appendix C. At test time, a running average of the variance over the training data is used. This method, which we call optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE, allows us to learn very efficiently as we use the optimal variance estimate at every training step. It is also easier to implement, as no separate optimizer for the variance parameter is needed. If the variance is not needed at test time, it can also be simply discarded after training.

Per-image optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE. Optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE uses a single variance value shared across all data points. However, the optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE also allows more powerful variance estimates, such as learning a variance value per each pixel, or even a variance value per each image, the difference in implementation simply being the dimensions across which the averaging in Equation 5 operates. This approach can be interpreted as a variational variance prediction in the framework of Stirn & Knowles (2020).

# 5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We now provide an empirical analysis of different decoding distributions, and validate the benefits of our  $\sigma$ -VAE approach. We use a small convolutional VAE model on SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), a larger hierarchical HVAE model (Maaloe et al., 2019) on the CelebA (Liu et al., 2015) and CIFAR (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) datasets, and a sequence VAE model called SVG (Denton & Fergus, 2018) on the BAIR Pushing dataset (Finn & Levine, 2017). We evaluate the ELBO values as well as visual quality measured by the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID, Heusel et al. (2017)). Images are  $28 \times 28$  for SVHN and  $32 \times 32$  for CelebA and CIFAR, while video experiments were performed on  $64 \times 64$  frames as in (Denton & Fergus, 2018). Further experimental details are in App. B.

Figure 2: Images or videos (bottom right) sampled from the proposed optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE and a unit variance Gaussian VAE models. The Gaussian VAE does not have a means to control the expressivity of the latent variable and produces suboptimal, blurry samples. The  $\sigma$ -VAE controls the expressivity by learning a calibrated decoder, and produces higher quality sequences on all datasets.

# 5.1 DO CALIBRATED DECODERS BALANCE THE VAE OBJECTIVE WITHOUT TUNING  $\beta$ ?

As detailed in Section 3.1, a  $\beta$ -VAE with a unit variance Gaussian decoder commonly used in prior work is equivalent to a  $\sigma$ -VAE with constant, manually tuned variance. There is a simple relationship between beta and the variance:  $\sigma = \sqrt{\beta / 2}$ . To compare the variance that the  $\sigma$ -VAE learns to the manually tuned variance in the case of the  $\beta$ -VAE, we compare the ELBO values and the corresponding values of  $\beta$  in Table 1. We find that learning the variance produces similar values of  $\beta$  to the manually tuned values in the  $\beta$ -VAE case, indicating that the  $\sigma$ -VAE is able to learn the balance between the two objective terms in a single training run, without hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, the  $\sigma$ -VAE

outperforms the best  $\beta$ -VAE run. This is because end-to-end learning produces better estimates of the variance than is possible with manual search, improving the likelihood (as measured by the lower bound) and the visual quality. Figure 3 shows the qualitative results from this experiment.

We further validate our results on both single-image and sequential VAE models on a range of datasets in Table 2 and Figure 2. Single-sample ELBO values are reported, and ELBO values on discretized data are reported for discrete distributions. We see that learning a shared variance in a Gaussian decoders (shared  $\sigma$ -VAE) outperforms the naive unit variance decoder (Gaussian VAE) as well as tuning the  $\beta$  constant for the Gaussian VAE manually. We also see that calibrated discrete decoders, such as full categorical distribution or mixture of discretized logistics, perform better than the naive Gaussian VAE. Using Bernoulli distribution by treating the color intensities as probabilities (Gregor et al., 2015;

![](images/00c52748b490f4589f52d44ef0a060fdec5d0939886127be27b53d59722dd0c7.jpg)  
Figure 3: Analysis of learned variance on SVHN. The parameter  $\beta$  is tuned manually in  $\beta$ -VAE and learned in  $\sigma$ -VAE. Higher values of  $\beta$  cause the images to lose detail, while lower values of  $\beta$  might make samples unrealistic. The proposed optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE is able to learn the balance end-to-end, here converging to an equivalent of  $\beta$ -VAE with  $\beta = 0.006$ . is because end-to-end learning produces better estimates of a search, improving the likelihood (as measured by the lower shows the qualitative results from this experiment.  
Table 1: Analysis of learned variance on SVHN. The parameter  $\beta$  is tuned manually in  $\beta$ -VAE and learned in  $\sigma$ -VAE.  $\sigma$ -VAE achieves better performance, while the value of  $\beta$  (implicitly defined via the decoder variance) automatically converges close the value found by manual tuning.

# 5.2 HOW DOES LEARNING CALIBRATED DECODERS IMPACT THE LATENT VARIABLE INFORMATION CONTENT?

We saw above that calibrated decoders result in higher log-likelihood bounds. Are calibrated decoders also beneficial for representation learning? We evaluate the mutual information  $I_{e}(x;z)$  between the data  $p_d(x)$  and encoder samples  $q(z|x)$ , as well as the mismatch between the prior  $p(z)$  and the marginal encoder distribution  $m(z) = E_{p_d(x)}q(z|x)$ , measured by the marginal KL  $D_{KL}(m(z)||p(z))$ . These terms are related to the rate term of the VAE objective as follows (Alemi et al., 2017):

$$
\begin{array}{l} E _ {p _ {d} (x)} \left[ D _ {K L} (q (z | x) | | p (z)) \right] = E _ {p _ {d} (x)} \left[ D _ {K L} (q (z | x) | | m (z)) \right] + D _ {K L} (m (z) | | p (z)) \\ = I _ {e} (x; z) + D _ {K L} (m (z) | | p (z)). \\ \end{array}
$$

That is, the rate term decomposes into the true mutual information and the marginal KL term. We want to learn expressive latent variables with high mutual information. However, doing so by tuning the  $\beta$  value relaxes the constraint that the encoder and the prior distributions match, and leads to degraded quality of samples from the prior, which creates a trade-off between expressive representations and ability to generate good samples. To compare the  $\beta$ -VAE and  $\sigma$ -VAE in terms of these quantities, we estimate the marginal KL term via Monte Carlo sampling, as proposed by Rosca et al. (2018), and plot the results in Figure 4. As expected, we see that lower  $\beta$  values lead to higher mutual information. However, after a certain point, lower values of  $\beta$  also cause a significant mismatch between the marginal and the prior distributions. By calculating the "effective"  $\beta$  for the  $\sigma$ -VAE, as per Section 4, we can see that the  $\sigma$ -VAE captures an inflection point in the  $D_{KL}(m(z)||p(z))$  term, learning a representation with the highest possible MI, but without degrading sample quality. This explains the high visual quality of the optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE samples: since the marginal and the prior distributions match, the samples from

![](images/7eba296dc5e2e56b5d7813bcff2a9862f8ef19d9885712c5cf6db79684564db6.jpg)  
Figure 4: Comparison of  $\beta$ -VAE and  $\sigma$ -VAE on SVHN in terms of mutual information  $I_{e}(x;z)$  and marginal KL divergence  $KL(m(z)||p(z))$  (see Sec. 5.2).  $I_{e}(x;z)$  increases with lower  $\beta$ , yielding expressive representations and better reconstruction. However, after a certain point, lowering  $\beta$  leads to a rapid increase in the marginal KL, yielding poor samples from the prior. The  $\sigma$ -VAE is able to automatically find the inflection point after which the marginal KL begins to increase, capturing as much information as possible while still producing good samples.

the prior look similar to reconstructions, while for a  $\beta$ -VAE with low  $\beta$ , the samples from the prior are poor. We see that, in contrast to the  $\beta$ -VAE, where the mutual information is controlled by a hyperparameter, the  $\sigma$ -VAE can adjust the appropriate amount of information automatically and is able to find the setting that produces both informative latents and high quality samples.

An alternative discussion of tuning  $\beta$  is presented by Alemi et al. (2017), who show that  $\beta$  controls the rate-distortion trade-off. Here, we show that the crucial trade-off also controlled by  $\beta$  is the trade-off between two components of the rate itself, which control expressivity of representations and the match between the variational and the prior distributions, respectively.

# 5.3 WHAT ARE THE COMMON CHALLENGES IN LEARNING THE VARIANCE THAT PREVENT PRACTITIONERS FROM USING IT, AND HOW TO RECTIFY THEM?

If learning the decoder variance improves generation, why are learned variances not used more often? In this section, we discuss how the naive approach to learning variances, where the decoder outputs a variance for each pixel along with the mean, leads to poor results. First, we find that this method often diverges very quickly due to numerical instability, as the network is able to predict

Table 2: Generative modeling performance of the proposed  $\sigma$ -VAE on different models and datasets. For SVG, we compare with the original method (Denton & Fergus, 2018), which uses  $\beta$ -VAE. We see that uncalibrated decoders such as mean-only Gaussian perform poorly.  $\beta$ -VAE allows to calibrate the decoder but needs careful hyperparameter tuning. Calibrated decoders such as categorical or  $\sigma$ -VAE perform best. [1] Gregor et al. (2015), [2] Takahashi et al. (2018), [3] Higgins et al. (2017).

certain pixels with very high certainty, leading to degenerate variances. In contrast, learning a shared variance is always numerically stable in our experiments. We can rectify this numerical instability by bounding the output variance (Section 3.1). However, even with bounded variance, we observe that learning per-pixel variances leads to poor results in Table 3. While the per-pixel variance achieves a good ELBO value, it produces very poor samples, as measured by FID and visual inspection. We hypothesize that the per-pixel decoder allocates significant capacity to learning the variance, which prevents it from learning to produce good samples.

# 5.4 CAN AN ANALYTIC SOLUTION FOR OPTIMAL VARIANCE FURTHER IMPROVE LEARNING?

We evaluate the optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE which uses an analytic solution for the variance (Section 4). Table 2 shows that it achieves superior results in terms of log-likelihood. We also note that the optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE converges to a good variance estimate instantaneously, which speeds up learning (highlighted in Figure 9 in the Appendix). In addition, we evaluate the per-image optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE, in which a single variance is computed per image. This model achieves significantly higher visual quality. While producing this per-image variance with a neural network would require additional architecture tuning, optimal  $\sigma$ -VAE is extremely simple to implement (it can be im

pleted simply as changing the axes of summation), not requiring any new tunable parameters.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We presented a simple and effective method for learning calibrated decoders, as well as an evaluation of different decoding distributions with several VAE and sequential VAE models. The proposed method outperforms methods that use naive unit variance Gaussian decoders and tune a heuristic weight  $\beta$  on the KL-divergence loss, as commonly done in prior work. Moreover, it does not use the heuristic weight  $\beta$ , making it easier to train than this prior work. We expect that the simple techniques for learning calibrated decoders can allow practitioners to speed up the development cycle, obtain better results, and reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
