# ABSTRACT

Learning policies from fixed offline datasets is a key challenge to scale up reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms towards practical applications. This is often because off-policy RL algorithms suffer from distributional shift, due to mismatch between dataset and the target policy, leading to high variance and over-estimation of value functions. In this work, we propose variance regularization for offline RL algorithms, using stationary distribution corrections. We show that by using Fenchel duality, we can avoid double sampling issues for computing the gradient of the variance regularizer. The proposed algorithm for offline variance regularization (OVR) can be used to augment any existing offline policy optimization algorithms. We show that the regularizer leads to a lower bound to the offline policy optimization objective, which can help avoid over-estimation errors, and explains the benefits of our approach across a range of continuous control domains when compared to existing algorithms.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Offline batch reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are key towards scaling up RL for real world applications, such as robotics (Levine et al., 2016) and medical problems. This is because offline RL provides the appealing ability for agents to learn from fixed datasets, similar to supervised learning, avoiding continual interaction with the environment, which could be problematic for safety and feasibility reasons. However, significant mismatch between the fixed collected data and the policy that the agent is considering can lead to high variance of value function estimates, a problem encountered by most off-policy RL algorithms (Precup et al., 2000). A complementary problem is that the value function can become overly optimistic in areas of state space that are outside the visited batch, leading the agent in data regions where its behavior is poor Fujimoto et al. (2019). Recently there has been some progress in offline RL (Kumar et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019b; Fujimoto et al., 2019), trying to tackle both of these problems.

In this work, we study the problem of offline policy optimization with variance minimization. To avoid overly optimistic value function estimates, we propose to learn value functions under variance constraints, leading to a pessimistic estimation, which can significantly help offline RL algorithms, especially under large distribution mismatch. We propose a framework for variance minimization in offline RL, such that the obtained estimates can be used to regularize the value function and enable more stable learning under different off-policy distributions.

We develop a novel approach for variance regularized offline actor-critic algorithms, which we call Offline Variance Regularizer (OVR). The key idea of OVR is to constrain the policy improvement step via variance regularized value function estimates. Our algorithmic framework avoids the double sampling issue that arises when computing gradients of variance estimates, by instead considering the variance of stationary distribution corrections with per-step rewards, and using the Fenchel transformation (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004) to formulate a minimax optimization objective. This allows minimizing variance constraints by instead optimizing dual variables, resulting in simply an augmented reward objective for variance regularized value functions.

We show that even with variance constraints, we can ensure policy improvement guarantees, where the regularized value function leads to a lower bound on the true value function, which mitigates the usual overestimation problems in batch RL. The use of Fenchel duality in computing the variance allows us to avoid double sampling, which has been a major bottleneck in scaling up variance-constrained

actor-critic algorithms in prior work A. & Ghavamzadeh (2016); A. & Fu (2018). Practically, our algorithm is easy to implement, since it simply involves augmenting the rewards with the dual variables only, such that the regularized value function can be implemented on top of any existing offline policy optimization algorithms. We evaluate our algorithm on existing offline benchmark tasks based on continuous control domains. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed variance regularization approach is particularly useful when the batch dataset is gathered at random, or when it is very different from the data distributions encountered during training.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES AND BACKGROUND

We consider an infinite horizon MDP as  $(S, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \gamma)$  where  $S$  is the set of states,  $\mathcal{A}$  is the set of actions,  $\mathcal{P}$  is the transition dynamics and  $\gamma$  is the discount factor. The goal of reinforcement learning is to maximize the expected return  $\mathcal{J}(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim d_{\beta}}[V^{\pi}(s)]$ , where  $V^{\pi}(s)$  is the value function  $V^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t} r(s_{t}, a_{t}) \mid s_{0} = s]$ , and  $\beta$  is the initial state distribution. Considering parameterized policies  $\pi_{\theta}(a|s)$ , the goal is to maximize the returns by following the policy gradient (Sutton et al., 1999), based on the performance metric defined as:

$$
J \left(\pi_ {\theta}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {s _ {0} \sim \rho , a _ {0} \sim \pi (s _ {0})} \left[ Q ^ {\pi_ {\theta}} \left(s _ {0}, a _ {0}\right) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\pi_ {\theta}} (s, a)} \left[ r (s, a) \right] \tag {1}
$$

where  $Q^{\pi}(s,a)$  is the state-action value function, since  $V^{\pi}(s) = \sum_{a}\pi (a|s)Q^{\pi}(s,a)$ . The policy optimization objective can be equivalently written in terms of the normalized discounted occupancy measure under the current policy  $\pi_{\theta}$ , where  $d_{\pi}(s,a)$  is the state-action occupancy measure, such that the normalized state-action visitation distribution under policy  $\pi$  is defined as:  $d_{\pi}(s,a) = (1 - \gamma)\sum_{t = 0}^{\infty}\gamma^{t}P(s_{t} = s,a_{t} = a|s_{0}\sim \beta ,a\sim \pi (s_{0}))$ . The equality in equation 1 holds and can be equivalently written based on the linear programming (LP) formulation in RL (see (Puterman, 1994; Nachum & Dai, 2020) for more details). In this work, we consider the off-policy learning problem under a fixed dataset  $\mathcal{D}$  which contains  $s,a,r,s'$  tuples under a known behaviour policy  $\mu (a|s)$ . Under the off-policy setting, importance sampling (Precup et al., 2000) is often used to reweight the trajectory under the behaviour data collecting policy, such as to get unbiased estimates of the expected returns. At each time step, the importance sampling correction  $\frac{\pi(a_t|s_t)}{\mu(a_t|s_t)}$  is used to compute the expected return under the entire trajectory as  $J(\pi) = (1 - \gamma)\mathbb{E}_{(s,a)\sim d_{\mu}(s,a)}[\sum_{t = 0}^{T}\gamma^{t}r(s_{t},a_{t})\left(\prod_{t = 1}^{T}\frac{\pi(a_{t}|s_{t})}{\mu(a_{t}|s_{t})}\right)]$ . Recent works (Fujimoto et al., 2019) have demonstrated that instead of importance sampling corrections, maximizing value functions directly for deterministic or reparameterized policy gradients (Lillicrap et al., 2016; Fujimoto et al., 2018) allows learning under fixed datasets, by addressing the over-estimation problem, by maximizing the objectives of the form  $\max_{\theta}\mathbb{E}_{s\sim \mathcal{D}}\Bigl [Q^{\pi_{\theta}}(s,\pi_{\theta}(s)\Bigr ]$ .

# 3 VARIANCE REGULARIZATION VIA DUALITY IN OFFLINE POLICY OPTIMIZATION

In this section, we first present our approach based on variance of stationary distribution corrections, compared to importance re-weighting of episodic returns in section 3.1. We then present a derivation of our approach based on Fenchel duality on the variance, to avoid the double sampling issue, leading to a variance regularized offline optimization objective in section 3.2. Finally, we present our algorithm in 1, where the proposed regularizer can be used in any existing offline RL algorithm.

# 3.1 VARIANCE OF REWARDS WITH STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION CORRECTIONS

In this work, we consider the variance of rewards under occupancy measures in offline policy optimization. Let us denote the returns as  $D^{\pi} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^{t} r(s_{t}, a_{t})$ , such that the value function is  $V^{\pi} = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[D^{\pi}]$ . The 1-step importance sampling ratio is  $\rho_{t} = \frac{\pi(a_{t}|s_{t})}{\mu(a_{t}|s_{t})}$ , and the T-steps ratio can be denoted  $\rho_{1:T} = \prod_{t=1}^{T} \rho_{t}$ . Considering per-decision importance sampling (PDIS) (Precup et al., 2000), the returns can be similarly written as  $D^{\pi} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^{t} r_{t} \rho_{0:t}$ . The variance of episodic returns, which we denote by  $\mathcal{V}_{\mathcal{P}}(\pi)$ , with off-policy importance sampling corrections can be written as:

$$
\mathcal {V} _ {\mathcal {P}} (\pi) = \mathbb {E} _ {s \sim \beta , a \sim \mu (\cdot | s), s ^ {\prime} \sim \mathcal {P} (\cdot | s, a)} \Big [ \Big (D ^ {\pi} (s, a) - J (\pi) \Big) ^ {2} \Big ].
$$

Instead of importance sampling, several recent works have instead proposed for marginalized importance sampling with stationary state-action distribution corrections (Liu et al., 2018; Nachum et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2020; Uehara & Jiang, 2019), which can lead to lower variance estimators at the cost of introducing bias. Denoting the stationary distribution ratios as  $\omega(s,a) = \frac{d_{\pi}(s,a)}{d_{\mu}(s,a)}$ , the returns can be written as  $W^{\pi}(s,a) = \omega(s,a)r(s,a)$ . The variance of marginalized IS is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {V} _ {\mathcal {D}} (\pi) = \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mu} (s, a)} \left[ \left(W ^ {\pi} (s, a) - J (\pi)\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mu} (s, a)} \left[ W ^ {\pi} (s, a) ^ {2} \right] - \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mu} (s, a)} \left[ W ^ {\pi} (s, a) \right] ^ {2} \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Our key contribution is to first consider the variance of marginalized IS  $V_{\mathcal{D}}(\pi)$  itself as a risk constraints, in the offline batch optimization setting. We show that constraining the offline policy optimization objective with variance of marginalized IS, and using the Fenchel-Legendre transformation on  $V_{\mathcal{D}}(\pi)$  can help avoid the well-known double sampling issue in variance risk constrained RL (for more details on how to compute the gradient of the variance term, see appendix B). We emphasize that the variance here is solely based on returns with occupancy measures, and we do not consider the variance due to the inherent stochasticity of the MDP dynamics.

# 3.2 VARIANCE REGULARIZED OFFLINE MAX-RETURN OBJECTIVE

We consider the variance regularized off-policy max return objective with stationary distribution corrections  $\omega_{\pi / \mathcal{D}}$  (which we denote  $\omega$  for short for clarity) in the offline fixed dataset  $\mathcal{D}$  setting:

$$
\max  _ {\pi_ {\theta}} J \left(\pi_ {\theta}\right) := \mathbb {E} _ {s \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ Q ^ {\pi_ {\theta}} \left(s, \pi_ {\theta} (s)\right) \right] - \lambda \mathcal {V} _ {\mathcal {D}} (\omega , \pi_ {\theta}) \tag {3}
$$

where  $\lambda \geq 0$  allows for the trade-off between offline policy optimization and variance regularization (or equivalently variance risk minimization). The max-return objective under  $Q^{\pi_{\theta}}(s,a)$  has been considered in prior works in offline policy optimization (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019). We show that this form of regularizer encourages variance minimization in offline policy optimization, especially when there is a large data distribution mismatch between the fixed dataset  $\mathcal{D}$  and induced data distribution under policy  $\pi_{\theta}$ .

# 3.3 VARIANCE REGULARIZATION VIA FENCHEL DUALITY

At first, equation 3 seems to be difficult to optimize, especially for minimizing the variance regularization w.r.t  $\theta$ . This is because finding the gradient of  $\mathcal{V}(\omega, \pi_{\theta})$  would lead to the double sampling issue since it contains the squared of the expectation term. The key contribution of OVR is to use the Fenchel duality trick on the second term of the variance expression in equation 2, for regularizing policy optimization objective with variance of marginalized importance sampling. Applying Fenchel duality,  $x^{2} = \max_{y}(2xy - y^{2})$ , to the second term of variance expression, we can transform the variance minimization problem into an equivalent maximization problem, by introducing the dual variables  $\nu(s, a)$ . We have the Fenchel conjugate of the variance term as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {V} (\omega , \pi_ {\theta}) = \max  _ {\nu} \left\{- \frac {1}{2} \nu (s, a) ^ {2} + \nu (s, a) \omega (s, a) r (s, a) + \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}}} \left[ \omega (s, a) r (s, a) ^ {2} \right] \right\} \tag {4} \\ = \max  _ {\nu} \quad \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}}} \left[ - \frac {1}{2} \nu (s, a) ^ {2} + \nu (s, a) \omega (s, a) r (s, a) + \omega (s, a) r (s, a) ^ {2} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Regularizing the policy optimization objective with variance under the Fenchel transformation, we therefore have the overall max-min optimization objective, explicitly written as :

$$
\max  _ {\theta} \min  _ {\nu} J (\pi_ {\theta}, \nu) := \mathbb {E} _ {s \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ Q ^ {\pi_ {\theta}} (s, \pi_ {\theta} (s)) \right] - \lambda \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}}} \left[ \left(- \frac {1}{2} \nu^ {2} + \nu \cdot \omega \cdot r + \omega \cdot r ^ {2}\right) (s, a) \right] \tag {5}
$$

# 3.4 AUGMENTED REWARD OBJECTIVE WITH VARIANCE REGULARIZATION

In this section, we explain the key steps that leads to the policy improvement step being an augmented variance regularized reward objective. The variance minimization step involves estimating the stationary distribution ration (Nachum et al., 2019a), and then simply computing the closed form solution for the dual variables. Fixing dual variables  $\nu$ , to update  $\pi_{\theta}$ , note that this leads to a standard maximum return objective in the dual form, which can be equivalently solved in the primal form,

using augmented rewards. This is because we can write the above above in the dual form as :

$$
\begin{array}{l} J (\pi_ {\theta}, \nu , \omega) := \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}} (s, a)} \Big [ \omega (s, a) \cdot r (s, a) - \lambda \Big (- \frac {1}{2} \nu^ {2} + \nu \cdot \omega \cdot r + \omega \cdot r ^ {2} \Big) (s, a) \Big ] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}} (s, a)} \left[ \omega (s, a) \cdot \left(r - \lambda \cdot \nu \cdot r - \lambda \cdot r ^ {2}\right) (s, a) + \frac {\lambda}{2} \nu (s, a) ^ {2} \right] \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}} (s, a)} \left[ \omega (s, a) \cdot \tilde {r} (s, a) + \frac {\lambda}{2} \nu (s, a) ^ {2} \right] \tag {6} \\ \end{array}
$$

where we denote the augmented rewards as :

$$
\tilde {r} (s, a) \equiv [ r - \lambda \cdot \nu \cdot r - \lambda \cdot r ^ {2} ] (s, a) \tag {7}
$$

The policy improvement step can either be achieved by directly solving equation 6 or by considering the primal form of the objective with respect to  $Q^{\pi_{\theta}}(s, \pi_{\theta})$  as in (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019). However, solving equation 6 directly can be troublesome, since the policy gradient step involves finding the gradient w.r.t  $\omega(s, a) = \frac{d_{\pi_{\theta}}(s, a)}{d_{\mathcal{D}}(s, a)}$  too, where the distribution ratio depends on  $d_{\pi_{\theta}}(s, a)$ . This means that the gradient w.r.t  $\theta$  would require finding the gradient w.r.t to the normalized discounted occupancy measure, i.e.,  $\nabla_{\theta} d_{\pi_{\theta}}(s)$ . Instead, it is therefore easier to consider the augmented reward objective, using  $\tilde{r}(s, a)$  as in equation 7 in any existing offline policy optimization algorithm, where we have the variance regularized value function  $\tilde{Q}^{\pi_{\theta}}(s, a)$ .

Note that as highlighted in (Sobel, 1982), the variance of returns follows a Bellman-like equation. Following this, (Bisi et al., 2019) also pointed to a Bellman-like solution for variance w.r.t occupancy measures. Considering variance of the form in equation 2, and the Bellman-like equation for variance, we can write the variance recursively as a Bellman equation:

$$
\mathcal {V} _ {\mathcal {D}} ^ {\pi} (s, a) = \left(r (s, a) - J (\pi)\right) ^ {2} + \gamma \mathbb {E} _ {s ^ {\prime} \sim \mathcal {P}, a ^ {\prime} \sim \pi^ {\prime} (\cdot | s ^ {\prime})} \left[ \mathcal {V} _ {\mathcal {D}} ^ {\pi} \left(s ^ {\prime}, a ^ {\prime}\right) \right] \tag {8}
$$

Since in our objective, we augment the policy improvement step with the variance regularization term, we can write the augmented value function as  $Q_{\lambda}^{\pi}(s,a) \coloneqq Q^{\pi}(s,a) - \lambda \mathcal{V}_{\mathcal{D}}^{\pi}(s,a)$ . This suggests we can modify existing policy optimization algorithms with augmented rewards on value function.

Remark : Applying Fenchel transformation to the variance regularized objective, however, at first glance, seems to make the augmented rewards dependent on the policy itself, since  $\tilde{r}(s,a)$  depends on the dual variables  $\nu(s,a)$  as well. This can make the rewards non-stationary, thereby the policy maximization step cannot be solved directly via the maximum return objective. However, as we discuss next, the dual variables for minimizing the variance term has a closed form solution  $\nu(s,a)$ , and thereby does not lead to any non-stationarity in the rewards, due to the alternating minimization and maximization steps.

Variance Minimization Step : Fixing the policy  $\pi_{\theta}$ , the dual variables  $\nu$  can be obtained using closed form solution given by  $\nu(s, a) = \omega(s, a) \cdot \tilde{r}(s, a)$ . Note that directly optimizing for the target policies using batch data, however, requires a fixed point estimate of the stationary distribution corrections, which can be achieved using existing algorithms (Nachum et al., 2019a; Liu et al., 2018). Solving the optimization objective additionally requires estimating the state-action distribution ratio,  $\omega(s, a) = \frac{d_{\pi}(s, a)}{d_{\mathcal{D}}(s, a)}$ . Recently, several works have proposed estimating the stationary distribution ratio, mostly for the off-policy evaluation case in infinite horizon setting (Zhang et al., 2020; Uehara & Jiang, 2019). We include a detailed discussion of this in appendix E.4.

Algorithm: Our proposed variance regularization approach with returns under stationary distribution corrections for offline optimization can be built on top of any existing batch off-policy optimization algorithms. We summarize our contributions in Algorithm 1. Implementing our algorithm requires estimating the state-action distribution ratio, followed by the closed form estimate of the dual variable  $\nu$ . The augmented stationary reward with the dual variables can then be used to compute the regularized value function  $Q_{\lambda}^{\pi}(s,a)$ . The policy improvement step involves maximizing the variance regularized value function, e.g with BCQ (Fujimoto et al., 2019).

# 4 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

In this section, we provide theoretical analysis of offline policy optimization algorithms in terms of policy improvement guarantees under fixed dataset  $\mathcal{D}$ . Following then, we demonstrate that using the variance regularizer leads to a lower bound for our policy optimization objective, which leads to a pessimistic exploitation approach for offline algorithms.

end for

# 4.1 VARIANCE OF MARGINALIZED IMPORTANCE SAMPLING AND IMPORTANCE SAMPLING

We first show in lemma 1 that the variance of rewards under stationary distribution corrections can similarly be upper bounded based on the variance of importance sampling corrections. We emphasize that in the off-policy setting under distribution corrections, the variance is due to the estimation of the density ratio compared to the importance sampling corrections.

Lemma 1. The following inequality holds between the variance of per-step rewards under stationary distribution corrections, denoted by  $\mathcal{V}_{\mathcal{D}}(\pi)$  and the variance of episodic returns with importance sampling corrections  $\mathcal{V}_{\mathcal{P}}(\pi)$

$$
\mathcal {V} _ {\mathcal {P}} (\pi) \leq \frac {\mathcal {V} _ {\mathcal {D}} (\pi)}{(1 - \gamma) ^ {2}} \tag {9}
$$

The proof for this and discussions on the variance of episodic returns compared to per-step rewards under occupancy measures is provided in the appendix B.1.

# 4.2 POLICY IMPROVEMENT BOUND UNDER VARIANCE REGULARIZATION

In this section, we establish performance improvement guarantees (Kakade & Langford, 2002) for variance regularized value function for policy optimization. Let us first recall that the performance improvement can be written in terms of the total variation  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}$  divergence between state distributions (Touati et al., 2020) (for more discussions on the performance bounds, see appendix C)

Lemma 2. For all policies  $\pi'$  and  $\pi$ , we have the performance improvement bound based on the total variation of the state-action distributions  $d_{\pi'}$  and  $d_{\pi}$

$$
J \left(\pi^ {\prime}\right) \geq \mathcal {L} _ {\pi} \left(\pi^ {\prime}\right) - \epsilon^ {\pi} \mathcal {D} _ {T V} \left(d _ {\pi^ {\prime}} \mid \mid d _ {\pi}\right) \tag {10}
$$

where  $\epsilon^{\pi} = \max_{s}|\mathbb{E}_{a\sim \pi^{\prime}(\cdot |s)}[A^{\pi}(s,a)]|,$  and  $\mathcal{L}_{\pi}(\pi^{\prime}) = J(\pi) + \mathbb{E}_{s\sim d_{\pi},a\sim \pi^{\prime}}[A^{\pi}(s,a)]$  . For detailed proof and discussions, see appendix C. Instead of considering the divergence between state visitation distributions, consider having access to both state-action samples generated from the environment. To avoid importance sampling corrections we can further consider the bound on the objective based on state-action visitation distributions, where we have an upper bound following from (Nguyen et al., 2010):  $D_{\mathrm{TV}}(d_{\pi '}(s)||d_{\pi}(s))\leq D_{\mathrm{TV}}(d_{\pi '}(s,a)||d_{\pi}(s,a))$  . Following Pinsker's inequality, we have:

$$
J \left(\pi^ {\prime}\right) \geq J (\pi) + \mathbb {E} _ {s \sim d _ {\pi} (s), a \sim \pi^ {\prime} (| s)} \left[ A ^ {\pi} (s, a) \right] - \epsilon^ {\pi} \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\pi} (s, a)} \left[ \sqrt {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(d _ {\pi^ {\prime}} (s , a) \mid \mid d _ {\pi} (s , a)\right)} \right] \tag {11}
$$

Furthermore, we can exploit the relation between KL, total variation (TV) and variance through the variational representation of divergence measures. Recall that the total divergence between P and Q distributions is given by:  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}(p,q) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{x}|p(x) - q(x)|$ . We can use the variational representation of the divergence measure. Denoting  $d_{\pi}^{\prime}(s,a) = \beta_{\pi^{\prime}}(s,a)$ , we have

$$
D _ {\mathrm {T V}} \left(\beta_ {\pi^ {\prime}} \mid \mid \beta_ {\pi}\right) = \sup  _ {f: \mathcal {S} \times \mathcal {A} \rightarrow \mathbb {R}} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim \beta_ {\pi^ {\prime}}} [ f (s, a) ] - \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim \beta (s, a)} \left[ \phi^ {*} \circ f (s, a) \right]\right] \tag {12}
$$

where  $\phi^{*}$  is the convex conjugate of  $\bar{\phi}$  and  $f$  is the dual function class based on the variational representation of the divergence. Similar relations with the variational representations of f-divergences have also been considered in (Nachum et al., 2019b; Touati et al., 2020). We can finally obtain a bound for the policy improvement following this relation, in terms of the per-step variance:

Theorem 1. For all policies  $\pi$  and  $\pi'$ , and the corresponding state-action visitation distributions  $d_{\pi'}$  and  $d_{\pi}$ , we can obtain the performance improvement bound in terms of the variance of rewards under state-action occupancy measures.

$$
J \left(\pi^ {\prime}\right) - J (\pi) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {s \sim d _ {\pi} (s), a \sim \pi^ {\prime} (a | s)} \left[ A ^ {\pi} (s, a) \right] - \operatorname {V a r} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\pi} (s, a)} \left[ f (s, a) \right] \tag {13}
$$

where  $f(s, a)$  is the dual function class from the variational representation of variance.

Proof. For detailed proof, see appendix C.1.

# 4.3 LOWER BOUND OBJECTIVE WITH VARIANCE REGULARIZATION

In this section, we show that augmenting the policy optimization objective with a variance regularizer leads to a lower bound to the original optimization objective  $J(\pi_{\theta})$ . Following from (Metelli et al., 2018), we first note that the variance of marginalized importance weighting with distribution corrections can be written in terms of the  $\alpha$ -Renyi divergence. Let  $p$  and  $q$  be two probability measures, such that the Renyi divergence is  $\mathcal{F}_{\alpha} = \frac{1}{\alpha}\log \sum_{x}q(x)\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right)^{\alpha}$ . When  $\alpha = 1$ , this leads to the well-known KL divergence  $\mathcal{F}_1(p||q) = \mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{KL}}(p||q)$ .

Let us denote the state-action occupancy measures under  $\pi$  and dataset  $\mathcal{D}$  as  $d_{\pi}$  and  $d_{\mathcal{D}}$ . The variance of state-action distribution ratios is  $\mathrm{Var}_{(s,a)\sim d_{\mathcal{D}}(s,a)}[\omega_{\pi /\mathcal{D}}(s,a)]$ . When  $\alpha = 2$  for the Renyi divergence, we have:

$$
\operatorname {V a r} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}} (s, a)} [ \omega_ {\pi / \mathcal {D}} (s, a) ] = \mathcal {F} _ {2} \left(d _ {\pi} \| d _ {\mathcal {D}}\right) - 1 \tag {14}
$$

Following from (Metelli et al., 2018), and extending results from importance sampling  $\rho$  to marginalized importance sampling  $\omega_{\pi / \mathcal{D}}$ , we provide the following result that bounds the variance of the approximated density ratio  $\hat{\omega}_{\pi / \mathcal{D}}$  in terms of the Renyi divergence:

Lemma 3. Assuming that the rewards of the MDP are bounded by a finite constant,  $||r||_{\infty} \leq R_{max}$ . Given random variable samples  $(s,a) \sim d_{\mathcal{D}}(s,a)$  from dataset  $\mathcal{D}$ , for any  $N > 0$ , the variance of marginalized importance weighting can be upper bounded as:

$$
\operatorname {V a r} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}} (s, a)} \left[ \hat {\omega} _ {\pi / \mathcal {D}} (s, a) \right] \leq \frac {1}{N} \| r \| _ {\infty} ^ {2} \mathcal {F} _ {2} \left(d _ {\pi} \| d _ {\mathcal {D}}\right) \tag {15}
$$

See appendix D.1 for more details. Following this, our goal is to derive a lower bound objective to our off-policy optimization problem. Concentration inequalities has previously been studied for both off-policy evaluation (Thomas et al., 2015a) and optimization (Thomas et al., 2015b). In our case, we can adapt the concentration bound derived from Cantelli's inequality and derive the following result based on variance of marginalized importance sampling. Under state-action distribution corrections, we have the following lower bound to the off-policy policy optimization objective with stationary state-action distribution corrections

Theorem 2. Given state-action occupancy measures  $d_{\pi}$  and  $d_{\mathcal{D}}$ , and assuming bounded reward functions, for any  $0 < \delta \leq 1$  and  $N > 0$ , we have with probability at least  $1 - \delta$  that:

$$
J (\pi) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {(s, a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}} (s, a)} \left[ \omega_ {\pi / \mathcal {D}} (s, a) \cdot r (s, a) \right] - \sqrt {\frac {1 - \delta}{\delta} \operatorname {V a r} _ {(s , a) \sim d _ {\mathcal {D}} (s , a)} \left[ \omega_ {\pi / \mathcal {D}} (s , a) \cdot r (s , a) \right]} \tag {16}
$$

Equation 16 shows the lower bound policy optimization objective under risk-sensitive variance constraints. The key to our derivation in equation 16 of theorem 2 shows that given off-policy batch data collected with behaviour policy  $\mu(a|s)$ , we are indeed optimizing a lower bound to the policy optimization objective, which is regularized with a variance term to minimize the variance in batch off-policy learning.

# 5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON BENCHMARK OFFLINE CONTROL TASKS

Experimental Setup : We demonstrate the significance of variance regularizer on a range of continuous control domains (Todorov et al., 2012) based on fixed offline datasets from (Fu et al., 2020), which is a standard benchmark for offline algorithms. To demonstrate the significance of our variance regularizer OVR, we mainly use it on top of the BCQ algorithm and compare it with other existing baselines, using the benchmark D4RL (Fu et al., 2020) offline datasets for different tasks and off-policy distributions. Experimental results are given in table 1

Performance on Optimal and Medium Quality Datasets : We first evaluate the performance of OVR when the dataset consists of optimal and mediocre logging policy data. We collected the dataset using a fully (expert) or partially (medium) trained SAC policy. We build our algorithm OVR on top of BCQ, denoted by  $\mathrm{BCQ} + \mathrm{VAR}$ . Note that the OVR algorithm can be agnostic to the behaviour policy too for computing the distribution ratio (Nachum et al., 2019a) and the variance. We observe that even

Table 1: The results on D4RL tasks compare BCQ (Fujimoto et al., 2019) with and without OVR, bootstrapping error reduction (BEAR) (Kumar et al., 2019), behavior-regularized actor critic with policy (BRAC-p) (Wu et al., 2019a), AlgeaDICE (aDICE) (Nachum et al., 2019b) and offline SAC (SAC-off) (Haarnoja et al., 2018). The results presented are the normalized returns on the task as per Fu et al. (2020) (see Table 3 in Fu et al. (2020) for the unnormalized scores on each task). We see that in most tasks we are able to significant gains using OVR. Our algorithm can be applied to any policy optimization baseline algorithm that trains the policy by maximizing the expected rewards. Unlike BCQ, BEAR (Kumar et al., 2019) does not have the same objective, as they train the policy using and MMD objective.

though performance is marginally improved with OVR under expert settings, since the demonstrations are optimal itself, we can achieve significant improvements under medium dataset regime. This is because OVR plays a more important role when there is larger variance due to distribution mismatch between the data logging and target policy distributions. Experimental results are shown in first two columns of figure 1.

Performance on Random and Mixed Datasets : We then evaluate the performance on random datasets, i.e., the worst-case setup when the data logging policy is a random policy, as shown in the last two columns of figure 1. As expected, we observe no improvements at all, and even existing baselines such as BCQ (Fujimoto et al., 2019) can work poorly under random dataset setting. When we collect data using a mixture of random and mediocre policy, denoted by mixed, the performance is again improved for OVR on top of BCQ, especially for the Hopper and Walker control domains. We provide additional experimental results and ablation studies in appendix E.1.

# 6 RELATED WORKS

We now discuss related works in offline RL, for evaluation and optimization, and its relations to variance and risk sensitive algorithms. We include more discussions of related works in appendix A.1. In off-policy evaluation, per-step importance sampling (Precup et al., 2000; 2001) have previously been used for off-policy evaluation function estimators. However, this leads to high variance estimators, and recent works proposed using marginalized importance sampling, for estimating stationary state-action distribution ratios (Liu et al., 2018; Nachum et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2019), to reduce variance but with additional bias. In this work, we build on the variance of marginalized IS, to develop variance risk sensitive offline policy optimization algorithm. This is in contrast to prior works on variance constrained online actor-critic (A. & Ghavamzadeh, 2016; Chow et al., 2017; Castro et al., 2012) and relates to constrained policy optimization methods (Achiam et al., 2017; Tessler et al., 2019).

For offline policy optimization, several works have recently addressed the overestimation problem in batch RL (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019b), including the very recently proposed Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) algorithm (Kumar et al., 2020). Our work is done in parallel to CQL, due to which we do not include it as a baseline in our experiments. CQL learns a value function which is guaranteed to lower-bound the true value function. This helps prevent value over-estimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, which is an important issue in offline RL. We

note that our approach is orthogonal to CQL in that CQL introduces a regularizer on the state action value function  $Q^{\pi}(s,a)$  based on the Bellman error (the first two terms in equation 2 of CQL), while we introduce a variance regularizer on the stationary state distribution  $d_{\pi}(s)$ . Since the value of a policy can be expressed in two ways - either through  $Q^{\pi}(s,a)$  or occupancy measures  $d_{\pi}(s)$ , both CQL and our paper are essentially motivated by the same objective of optimizing a lower bound on  $J(\theta)$ , but through different regularizers. Our work can also be considered similar to AlgaeDICE (Nachum et al., 2019b), since we introduce a variance regularizer based on the distribution corrections, instead of minimizing the f-divergence between stationary distributions in AlgaeDICE. Both our work and AlgaeDICE considers the dual form of the policy optimization objective in the batch setting, where similar to the Fenchel duality trick on our variance term, AlgaeDICE instead uses the variational form, followed by the change of variables tricks, inspired from (Nachum et al., 2019a) to handle their divergence measure.

# 7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We proposed a new framework for offline policy optimization with variance regularization called OVR, to tackle high variance issues due to distribution mismatch in offline policy optimization. Our work provides a practically feasible variance constrained actor-critic algorithm that avoids double sampling issues in prior variance risk sensitive algorithms (Castro et al., 2012; A. & Ghavamzadeh, 2016). The presented variance regularizer leads to a lower bound to the true offline optimization objective, thus leading to pessimistic value function estimates, avoiding both high variance and overestimation problems in offline RL. Experimentally, we evaluate the significance of OVR on standard benchmark offline datasets, with different data logging off-policy distributions, and show that OVR plays a more significant role when there is large variance due to distribution mismatch. While we only provide a variance related risk sensitive approach for offline RL, for future work, it would be interesting other risk sensitive approaches (Chow & Ghavamzadeh, 2014; Chow et al., 2017) and examine its significance in batch RL. We hope our proposed variance regularization framework would provide new opportunities for developing practically robust risk sensitive offline algorithms.
