# ABSTRACT

Determining the optimal size of a neural network for a given task is a challenging problem that is often addressed through a combination of expert tuning, random search or black-box bayesian optimization. These methods have two drawbacks: (A) They are expensive because training has to be started anew for each network size considered and (B) They cannot seize upon performance improvements that may arise by altering the network architecture during a single training cycle. In this paper, we present a framework for adapting the network size during training so as to find a good architecture automatically while possibly squeezing additional performance from that architecture. We do this by continuously adding new units to the network during training while removing the least useful units via an  $\ell_2$  penalty. We train the network with a novel algorithm, which we term "Adaptive Radial-Angular Gradient Descent" or AdaRad.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Sigmoid or ReLU? Dropout or DropConnect?  $\ell_2$  or  $\ell_1$ ? These are just some of the many modelling choices that have to be made when designing a neural network. Making these choices is very challenging. Some reasons for this are (A) the incredibly large space of possible network configurations - e.g. we could choose a different non-linearity for each individual unit - (B) the fact that many choices are discrete - e.g. between different regularization or data augmentation schemes - or structured - e.g. we can only choose a nonlinearity for a layer if that layer was chosen to exist in the first place - and (C) many choices can have a small or no impact on performance while the impact of a few choices, which are not known in advance, is significant.

Formally, let  $\Theta$  be the space of all neural network models considered. The goal of model selection is then, usually, to find the value of the hyperparameter  $\theta \in \Theta$  that maximizes a certain criterion  $c(\theta)$ , such as the validation error achieved by the network configuration represented by  $\theta$  when trained to convergence. Because  $\Theta$  is large, structured and heterogeneous,  $c$  is complex, and gradients of  $c$  are generally not available, the most popular methods for optimizing  $c$  are zero-order, black-box optimization schemes that do not use any information about  $c$  except its value for certain values of  $\theta$ . These methods select one or more values of  $\theta$ , evaluate  $c$  at those values and, based on the results, select new values of  $\theta$  until convergence is achieved or a time limit is reached. The most popular such methods are grid search, random search (e.g. Bergstra & Bengio (2012)) and bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes (e.g. Snoek et al. (2012)).

The black-box methods have two drawbacks. (A) To obtain each value of  $c$ , they must execute a full network training cycle. Each cycle can take weeks on many cores or multiple GPUs. (B) They do not exploit opportunities to improve the value of  $c$  further by altering  $\theta$  during each network training cycle.

One of the most important modelling choices is the size of the network (i.e. the number of units in each layer). In this paper, we present a framework called nonparametric neural networks for selecting network size. It dynamically shrinks and expands the network as needed to select a good network size automatically during a single training cycle. Further, by altering network size during training, it can achieve a higher accuracy for the network ultimately chosen than if that network had been trained from scratch and, in some cases, obtain a higher accuracy than is possible by black-box methods.

In section 2, we introduce the nonparametric framework and state its theoretical soundness, which we prove in section 7.1. In section 3, we develop the machinery for training nonparametric networks, including a novel normalization layer in section 3.1, CapNorm, and a novel training algorithm in section 3.2, AdaRad. We provide experimental evaluation and analysis in section 4, further relevant literature in section 5 and conclude in section 6.

# 2 NONPARAMETRIC NEURAL NETWORKS

For the purpose of this section, we define a parametric neural network as a function  $f(x) = \sigma_L(\sigma_{L-1}(. \sigma_2(\sigma_1(xW_1)W_2)) W_L)$  of a  $d_0$ -dimensional row vector  $x$ , where  $W_l \in \mathbb{R}^{d_l - 1 * d_l}$ ,  $1 \leq l \leq L$  are dense weight matrices of fixed dimension and  $f_l: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, 1 \leq l \leq L$  are fixed non-linear transformations that are applied elementwise, as signified by the .() operator. The number of layers  $L$  is also fixed. Further, the weight matrices are trained by solving the following minimization problem:  $\min_{\mathbf{W}=(W)_l} \frac{1}{|D|} \sum_{(x,y) \in D} e(f(x,\mathbf{W}),y) + \Omega(\mathbf{W})$ , where  $D$  is the dataset,  $e$  is an error function that consumes a vector of fixed length  $d_L$  and the label  $y$ , and  $\Omega$  is the regularizer.

We define a nonparametric neural network in the same way, except that the dimensionality of the weight matrices is undetermined. Hence, the optimization problem becomes:

$$
\min  _ {\mathbf {d} = (d) _ {l}, d _ {l} \in \mathbb {Z} _ {+}, 1 \leq l \leq L - 1} \min  _ {\mathbf {W} = (W) _ {l}, W _ {l} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {l} - 1 * d _ {l}}, 1 \leq l \leq L} \frac {1}{| D |} \sum_ {(x, y) \in D} e (f (\mathbf {W}, x), y) + \Omega (\mathbf {W}) \tag {1}
$$

Note that the dimensions  $d_0$  and  $d_L$  are fixed because the data and the error function  $e$  are fixed. The parameter value now takes the form of a pair  $(\mathbf{d}, \mathbf{W})$ .

In the nonparametric setting, because the existence of a global minimum is not guaranteed, we may be able to reduce the error further and further by using larger and larger networks. This would be problematic, because as networks become better and better with regards to the objective, they would become more and more undesirable in practice. It turns out that in an important case, this degeneration does not occur. Define the fan-in regularizer  $\Omega_{in}$  and the fan-out regularizer  $\Omega_{out}$  as follows:

$$
\Omega_ {i n} (\mathbf {W}, \lambda , p) = \lambda \sum_ {l = 1} ^ {L} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {d _ {l}} | | [ W _ {l} (1, j), W _ {l} (2, j),.., W _ {l} (d _ {l - 1}, j) ] | | _ {p} \tag {2}
$$

$$
\Omega_ {o u t} (\mathbf {W}, \lambda , p) = \lambda \sum_ {l = 1} ^ {L} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {d _ {l - 1}} | | [ W _ {l} (i, 1), W _ {l} (i, 2),.., W _ {l} (i, d _ {l}) ] | | _ {p} \tag {3}
$$

In plain language, we either penalize the incoming weights of each unit (fan-in) with a  $p$ -norm, or their outgoing weights (fan-out). We now state the core theorem that justifies our formulation of nonparametric networks. The proof is found in the appendix in section 7.1.

Theorem 1. A nonparametric neural network achieves its global training error minimum for some finite dimensionality  $\mathbf{d}_{opt}$  when  $\Omega$  is either a fan-in or fan-out regularizer with  $\lambda >0$  and  $1\leq p < \infty$ .

# 3 TRAINING NONPARAMETRIC NETWORKS

Training nonparametric networks is more difficult than training parametric networks, because the space over which we optimize the parameter  $(\mathbf{d},\mathbf{W})$  is no longer a space of form  $\mathbb{R}^d$ , but an infinite, discrete union of such spaces. However, we would still like to utilize local, gradient-based search. We notice, like (Wei et al., 2016), that there are pairs of parameter values with different dimensionality that are still in some sense "close" to one another. Specifically, we say that two parameter values  $(\mathbf{d}_1,\mathbf{W}_1)$  and  $(\mathbf{d}_2,\mathbf{W}_2)$  are  $f$ -equivalent if  $\forall x\in \mathbb{R}^{d_0}$ ,  $f(\mathbf{W}_1,x) = f(\mathbf{W}_2,x)$

where not necessarily  $\mathbf{d}_1 = \mathbf{d}_2$ . During iterative optimization, we can then "jump" between those two parameter values while maintaining  $f$  and thus preserving locality. We define a zero unit as any unit for which either the fan-in or fan-out is the zero vector. The most obvious way of generating an  $f$ -equivalent parameter value from an existing one is to add a zero unit to any hidden layer. Further, if we have a parameter value that already contains a zero unit, removing it yields an  $f$ -equivalent parameter value.

Thus, we will use the following strategy for training nonparametric networks: We use gradient-based methods to adjust  $\mathbf{W}$  while periodically adding and removing zero units. It should be noted that while adding and removing zero units leaves  $f$  invariant, it does change the value of the fan-in and fan-out regularizers and thus the value of the objective. While it is possible to design regularizers that do not penalize such zero units, this is highly undesirable as it would stifle the regularizers ability to "reign in" the growth of the network during training and would make it impossible to satisfy theorem 1 under practical conditions.

To be able to reduce the network size during training, we must produce zero units and, it turns out, the fan-in and fan-out regularizers naturally produce such units as they induce sparsity, i.e. they cause individual weights to become exactly zero. This is well studied under the umbrella of sparse regression (see e.g. Tibshirani (1996)). The cases  $p = 1$  and  $p = 2$  are especially attractive because it is computationally convenient to integrate them into a gradient-based optimization framework via a shrinkage / group shrinkage operator respectively (see e.g. Back & Teboulle (2006)). Further,  $p = 1$  and  $p = 2$  differ in their effect on the parameter value.  $p = 1$  sets individual weights to zero and thus leads to sparse fan-ins and fan-outs and thus ultimately to sparse weight matrices.  $p = 2$ , on the other hand, sets entire fan-ins (for the fan-in regularizer) or fan-outs (for the fan-out regularizer) to zero at once. (For a comparison, see Yuan & Lin (2006).) After the removal of these zero units, we obtain dense weight matrices. As neural network implementations are generally optimized for dense weight matrices, we will focus on the case  $p = 2$  for the remainder of the paper. Further, we will focus on fan-in rather than fan-out regularizers.

# 3.1 CAPPED BATCH NORMALIZATION (CapNorm)

Adding and removing units during training makes it challenging to maintain a proper conditioning of the network. Recently, Ioffe & Szegedy (2015) proposed a strategy called batch normalization that quickly became the standard for keeping feed-forward networks well-conditioned during training. In our experiments, nonparametric networks trained without batch normalization could not compete with parametric networks trained with it. Batch normalization cannot be applied directly to non-parametric networks with a fan-in or fan-out regularizer, as it would allow us to shrink the absolute value of individual weights arbitrarily while compensating with the batch normalization layer, thus negating the regularizer. Hence, we make a small adjustment which results in a strategy we term capped batch normalization or CapNorm. We subtract the mean of the activations of each hidden unit, but only scale their standard deviation if that standard deviation is greater than one. If it is less than one, we do not scale it. Also, after the normalization, we do not add or multiply the result with a free parameter. Hence, CapNorm replaces the hidden activation  $z$  with  $\frac{z - \mu}{\max(\sigma, 1)}$ , where  $\mu$  is the mini-batch mean and  $\sigma$  is the mini-batch standard deviation.

# 3.2 ADAPTIVE RADIAL-ANGULAR GRADIENT DESCENT (AdaRad)

The staple method for training neural networks is stochastic gradient descent. Further, there are several popular variants: momentum and nesterov momentum (Sutskever et al., 2013), AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) and AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012), RMSprop (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) and Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015). All of these methods center around two key principles: (1) averaging the gradient obtained over consecutive iterations to smooth out oscillations and (2) normalizing the gradient on each individual weight so that each weight learns at roughly the same speed. Principle (2) turns out to be especially important for nonparametric neural networks for the following reason: when a new unit is added, it does not initially contribute to the quality of the output. Hence, it does not receive much gradient and thus may take a very long time to learn anything useful.

We cannot normalize the gradient outright as in e.g. RMSprop, as this would scale up the amount of shrinkage applied, which would reduce the fan-in to zero before the unit can learn anything useful. Our solution is to decompose the gradient of each fan-in into its radial and orthogonal component.

Then, we normalize only the orthogonal component while keeping the radial component intact so that both the shrinkage operation and the component of the gradient that "balances" the shrinkage are unaltered. Finally, the normalized gradient is added in radial-angular coordinates instead of cartesian coordinates. This allows us to reap the benefits of normalization (fast training) under the mechanism of fan-in regularization.

Algorithm 1: AdaRad with  $\ell_2$  fan-in regularizer and unit addition / removal in its most instructive (bot not fastest) order of computation. Note that  $\mathbb{I}_i$  notation is used to indicate a vector over index  $i$ .

There are two step sizes: One for the radial and one for the angular component,  $\alpha_{r}$  and  $\alpha_{\phi}$  respectively. This is desirable as they both control the behavior of the training algorithm in very different ways. The radial step size controls how long it takes for a unit to be shrunk to a zero unit, i.e. the time a unit has to learn something useful. On the other hand, the angular step size controls the general speed of learning and is tuned to achieve the quickest possible descent along the error surface.

AdaRad is shown in detail in algorithm 1. Like RMSprop, this version does not make use of the principle of momentum. We have developed a variant called AdaRad-M that does. It is described in the appendix in section 7.2.

In color, we show how each element corresponds to our definition of a neural network in section 2. CapNorm does not fully fit our definition of nonlinearity as it requires information from multiple datapoints to compute its value. Hence, theorem 1 does not technically apply. However, CapNorm is a benign operation that does not lead to problems in practice.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We evaluated our method using three standard benchmark datasets - the mnist dataset, the rectangles images dataset and the convex dataset (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012). We used the network shown in Figure 1 utilizing ReLU nonlinearities (Dahl et al., 2013) and CapNorm, and trained it with AdaRad. We used two hidden layers ( $L = 3$ ) and started off with ten units in each layer and each fan-in initialized randomly with expected length 1. We add one new unit with random fan-in of expected length 1 and zero fan-out to each layer every epoch. While this does not lead to fast convergence - we have to wait until tens or hundreds of units are added - we believe that growing nets from scratch is a good test case for investigating the robustness of our method. After the validation error stopped improving, we ceased adding units, allowing the remaining unnecessary units to be eliminated. We set  $\alpha_{r} = \frac{1}{50\lambda}$  in all experiments, as this would allow each newly created unit  $\approx 50$  epochs to train before being eliminated by shrinkage, assuming no impact from the radial gradient.

For parametric training, we replaced CapNorm with batch normalization layers, either with or without trainable free mean and variance parameters. We trained the network using one of the following algorithms: SGD, momentum, nesterov momentum, RMSprop or Adam. Further experimental details can be found in the appendix in section 7.3.

# 4.1 PERFORMANCE

In this section, we investigate our two core questions: (A) Does nonparametric training yield good-sized networks? (B) Does nonparametric training produce nets with higher accuracy than would be possible if the same net was trained in parametric mode?

Through preliminary experiments, we determined a good starting angular step size for nonparametric training for all datasets. We chose to start with  $\alpha_{\phi} = 30$  and repeatedly divided the step size by 3 when the validation error stopped improving. By varying the random seed, we trained 10 nets each for several values of the regularization parameter  $\lambda$  per dataset and then chose a typical representative from among those 10 nets. Results are shown in black in figure 2. Values of  $\lambda$  are  $3 * 10^{-3}$ ,  $10^{-3}$  and  $3 * 10^{-4}$  for MNIST,  $3 * 10^{-5}$  and  $10^{-6}$  for rectangles images and  $10^{-5}$  and  $10^{-8}$  for convex.

Then, we trained networks of the same size as the chosen representatives in parametric mode. The top performers after an exhaustive grid search are shown in red in figure 2. Finally, we conducted an exhaustive random search where we also varied the size of both hidden layers. The top performers are shown in blue in the same figure.

We obtain different results for the three datasets. For mnist, nonparametric networks substantially outperform parametric networks of the same size. The best nonparametric network is close in performance to the best parametric network, while being substantially smaller (144 first layer units versus 694). For rectangles images, nonparametric training underperforms parametric training for larger  $\lambda$  and outperforms it for smaller  $\lambda$ . Here, the best nonparametric network has the globally best performance, as measured by the median test error over 10 random reruns, using substantially fewer parameters than the best parametric network.

While results for the first two datasets are very promising, our method performed badly for the convex dataset. Parametric networks of the same size perform substantially better than nonparametric networks, which also have a greater range of performance. Even if the architecture found by nonparametric training were re-trained in parametric mode, the tendency of nonparametric training to return small networks hurts us here as we would still miss out on a significant amount of performance.

We also conducted experiments with AdaRad-M, but found that performance was very similar to that of AdaRad. Hence, we omit the results. We also found no significant difference between RMSprop and Adam in parametric training.

# 4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE NONPARAMETRIC TRAINING PROCESS

In this section, we analyze in detail a single training run of a nonparametric network. We chose mnist as dataset, set  $\lambda = 3 * 10^{-4}$  and lowered the angular step size to 10 as we did not use step size annealing. We trained for 1000 epochs while adding one unit to each hidden layer per epoch, then trained another 1000 epochs without adding new units. The final network produced had 193 units the first hidden layer and 36 units in the second hidden layer. The results are shown in figure 3.

In part (A), we show the validation classification error. As a comparison, we trained the same network in parametric mode for 1000 epochs, once using SGD and the same  $\alpha$  and  $\lambda$  as the non-parametric network, and once using optimal settings (RMSprop,  $\alpha = 300$ ,  $\lambda = 0$ ). It is clear that parametric training reaches a good accuracy level much faster. This is not surprising, as the non-parametric network must wait for all its units to be added. Also, the parametric network converges much faster and attains a higher accuracy when the step size is increased ( $\alpha = 300$ ). This was true throughout our experimental evaluation.

In (B), we show the training cross-entropy error for the same training runs. Interestingly, parametric training reaches an error very close to zero. In fact, the unregularized model reaches a value of  $\approx 10^{-6}$  and the regularized model reaches a value of  $\approx 10^{-4}$ . Both made zero classification mistakes on the training set after training. In contrast, nonparametric training did not have a near-zero training error. Towards the end of training, it still misclassified around 30 out of 50.000 training examples. However, this discrepancy did not harm its performance on the validation or test set. In fact, the validation error of nonparametric networks tends to improve slowly for many epochs, whereas unregularized parametric networks (which were the best parametric networks when early stopping is used) tended to have a slightly increasing validation error in the long run.

In (C), we show the size of the two hidden layers during training. These curves are very typical of all training runs we examined. For the first  $\approx 50$  epochs, no units are eliminated. This is because we chose  $\alpha_{r} = \frac{1}{50\lambda}$ , which guarantees that units that are added with a fan-in of length 1 take 50 epochs to be eliminated, assuming no impact from the radial gradient. If the layer requires a relatively large number of neurons, it will keep growing linearly for a while and then either plateau or shrink slightly.

Figure 3: Detailed statistics of a nonparametric training run. See main text for details.

Once we no longer add units after 1000 epochs, both layers will shrink linearly by  $\approx 50$  neurons over  $\approx 50$  iterations, as the neurons that were added between epochs 950 and 1000 are eliminated in succession. Overall, this process shows the value of controlling  $\alpha_{\phi}$  and  $\alpha_{r}$  independently, as can we manage the "overhead" of extraneous units present during training while still ensuring an ideal speed of learning. In (D), we show the length of time individual units in the first hidden layer were present during training. On the x axis, we show the epoch during which a given unit was added. On the y axis, we show the number of epochs the unit was present. Green bars represent units that survived till the end, while black bars represent units that did not. As one might expect, units were more likely to survive the earlier they were added. Units that did not survive were eliminated in  $\approx 50$  epochs. The same graph for the second hidden layer is shown in figure 4.

In (E) and (F), we show the lengths of fan-ins (blue) and fan-outs (red) of units in the hidden layers. For each layer, we depict the following units in dark colors: three randomly chosen units that were initially present as well as units that were added at epochs 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, ..., 1000. In addition, in light colors, we show three units that were added late but not eliminated. We see a consistent pattern for individual units. First, their length decreases linearly as the CapNorm layer filters the radial gradient as long as the standard deviation of the activations  $\sigma$  exceeds 1. During this period, the unit learns something useful and so the fan-out increases in size. When finally  $\sigma < 1$ , the incoming radial gradient starts to slow down the decay and, if the unit has become useful enough, reverses it. It the decay is not reversed, the unit is eliminated. If it is reversed, both fan-in and fan-out will attain a size comparable to those of well-established units.

From a global perspective, we notice that fan-ins in the first layer are much smaller than 1. This is because first layer units encode primarily AND functions of highly correlated input features, meaning weights of small magnitude are sufficient to attain  $\sigma = 1$ . In contrast, lengths of fan-ins in the second layer are more chaotic. We found this is because  $\sigma = 1$  is generally NOT attained in the second layer. In fact, the network compensated for lower activation values in the second layer by assigning fan-ins of stable lengths between 3.5 and 4.5 to the 10 output units. Note that ReLU units have the property that  $f$  is invariant when each  $W_{l}$  is multiplied by a  $c_{l}$  with  $\prod_{l} c_{l} = 1$ , as long as CapNorm does not interfere. This will lead the network to assign variance to each layer depending on the number of units in it, so as to minimize  $\Omega$  overall.

# 5 FURTHER BACKGROUND

As mentioned in the introduction, the most popular zero-order, black-box model selection methods are grid search, random search (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012) and bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes (e.g. Snoek et al. (2012). Other proposed schemes utilize random forests (Hutter et al., 2009) and deep neural networks (Snoek et al., 2015).

Several strategies have been introduced to address the drawbacks of black-box methods. Maclaurin et al. (2015) indeed calculate the gradient of the validation error after training with respect to certain hyperparameters, though their method only applies to specific networks trained with specific algorithms. (Luketina et al., 2016) and (Larsen et al., 1998) train the hyperparameter jointly with the network using second order information. Such methods are limited to continuous hyperparameters and are often applied specifically to regularization hyperparameters. Saxe et al. (2011) speeds up the global search over network architectures by using the validation error with randomly initialized convolutional layers as a proxy for the validation error after training.

Several papers have achieved increased performance by altering the network size during the training process. Our main inspiration was Wei et al. (2016), who utilize a notion similar to our  $f$ -equivalence to enlarge the network during training, though they apply this in a somewhat ad-hoc way. Chen et al. (2016) is similar, but focuses on convergence speed. Pandey & Dukkipati (2014) transforms a trained small network into a larger network by multiplying weight matrices with large, random matrices.

The performance of a network of given size can be improved by injecting knowledge from other nets trained on the same task. Ba & Caruana (2014) use the predictions of a large network on a dataset to train a smaller network on those predictions, achieving an accuracy comparable to the large network. Hinton et al. (2015) compress the information stored in an ensemble of networks into a single network. Simonyan & Zisserman (2015) train very deep convolutional networks by initializing some layers with the trained layers of shallower networks. Romero et al. (2015) train deep, thin networks utilizing hints from wider, shallower networks.

Bayesian neural networks (e.g. McKay (1992), De Freitas (2003)) use a probabilistic prior instead of a regularizer to control the complexity of the network. Gaussian processes can be used to mimic "infinitely wide" neural networks (e.g. Williams (1997), Hazan & Jaakkola (2015)), thus eliminating the need to choose layer width and replacing it with the need to choose a Kernel. Compared to these and other Bayesian approaches, we work within the popular feedforward function optimization paradigm, which has advantages in terms of computational and algorithmic complexity.

Adding units to a network one at a time is an idea with a long history. Ash (1989) adds units to a single hidden layer, whereas Gallant (1986) builds up pyramid and tower structures and Fahlman & Lebiere (1990) effectively creates a new layer for each new unit. While these papers provided inspiration to us, the methods they present for determining when to add a new unit requires training the network to convergence first, which is impractical in modern settings. We circumvent this problem by adding units agnostically and providing a mechanism for removing unnecessary units.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We introduced nonparametric neural networks - a simple, general framework for adapting the size of a neural network during training. By doing so, we improved the performance of the resulting nets beyond what is achievable with parametric training of nets of the same size and achieved results competitive with those of an exhaustive random search, for two of three datasets. While we believe there is room for performance improvement in several areas - e.g. unit initialization, unit addition schedule and starting network size - we see this paper as validation of the basic concept. We proved the theoretical soundness of the framework and analyzed its behavior in detail.

In future work, we plan to extend our framework to convolutional layers as well as automatically choosing the depth of networks, to build very deep networks resembling e.g. residual networks (He et al., 2016). Part of our motivation to develop nonparametric networks was to control the layer size via a continuous parameter. We want to make use of this by tuning  $\lambda$  during training, either by simple annealing or in a comprehensive framework such as the one introduced in Luketina et al. (2016). Finally, we want to use nonparametric networks to learn more complicated network topologies for e.g. semi-supervised or multi-task learning.
