# ABSTRACT

Neural link predictors are immensely useful for identifying missing edges in large scale Knowledge Graphs. However, it is still not clear how to use these models for answering more complex queries that arise in a number of domains, such as queries using logical conjunctions (∧), disjunctions (∨) and existential quantifiers (∃), while accounting for missing edges. In this work, we propose a framework for efficiently answering complex queries on incomplete Knowledge Graphs. We translate each query into an end-to-end differentiable objective, where the truth value of each atom is computed by a pre-trained neural link predictor. We then analyse two solutions to the optimisation problem, including gradient-based and combinatorial search. In our experiments, the proposed approach produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods — black-box neural models trained on millions of generated queries — without the need of training on a large and diverse set of complex queries. Using orders of magnitude less training data, we obtain relative improvements ranging from 7% up to 23% in Hits@3 across different knowledge graphs containing factual information. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the outcome of our model in terms of the intermediate solutions identified for each of the complex query atoms.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are graph-structured knowledge bases, where knowledge about the world is stored in the form of relationship between entities. KGs are an extremely flexible and versatile knowledge representation formalism - examples include general purpose knowledge bases such as DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) and YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), domain-specific ones such as Bio2RDF (Dumontier et al., 2014) and Hetionet (Himmelstein et al., 2017) for life sciences and WordNet (Miller, 1992) for linguistics, and application-driven graphs such as the Google Knowledge Graph, Microsoft's Bing Knowledge Graph, and Facebook's Social Graph (Noy et al., 2019).

Neural link predictors (Nickel et al., 2016) tackle the problem of identifying missing edges in large KGs. However, in many complex domains, an open challenge is developing techniques for answering complex queries involving multiple and potentially unobserved edges, entities, and variables, rather than just single edges.

We focus on First-Order Logical Queries that use conjunctions  $(\land)$ , disjunctions  $(\lor)$ , and existential quantifiers  $(\exists)$ . A multitude of queries can be expressed by using such operators – for instance, the query “Which drugs  $D$  interact with proteins associated with diseases  $t_1$  or  $t_2$ ?” can be rewritten as  $?D: \exists P.\text{interacts}(D, P) \land [\text{assoc}(P, t_1) \lor \text{assoc}(P, t_2)]$ , which can be answered via sub-graph matching.

However, plain sub-graph matching cannot capture semantic similarities between entities and relations, and cannot deal with missing facts in the KG. One possible solution consists in computing all missing entries via KG completion methods (Getoor & Taskar, 2007; Raedt, 2008; Nickel et al., 2016), but that would materialise a significantly denser KG and would have intractable space and time complexity requirements (Krompaß et al., 2014).

In this work, we propose a framework for answering First-Order Logic Queries, where the query is compiled in an end-to-end differentiable function, modelling the interactions between its atoms. The truth value of each atom is computed by a neural link predictor (Nickel et al., 2016) – a differentiable

model that, given an atomic query, returns the likelihood that the fact it represents holds true. We then propose two approaches for identifying the most likely values for the variable nodes in a query - either by continuous or by combinatorial optimisation.

Recent work on embedding logical queries on KGs (Hamilton et al., 2018; Daza & Cochez, 2020; Ren et al., 2020) has suggested that in order to go beyond link prediction, more elaborate architectures, and a large and diverse dataset with millions of queries is required. In this work, we show that this is not the case, and demonstrate that it is possible to use an efficient neural link predictor trained for 1-hop query answering, to generalise to up to 8 complex query structures. By doing so, we produce more accurate results than state-of-the-art models, while using orders of magnitude less training data.

Summarising, in comparison with other approaches in the literature such as Query2Box (Ren et al., 2020), we find that the proposed framework i) achieves significantly better or equivalent predictive accuracy on a wide range of complex queries, ii) is capable of out-of-distribution generalisation, since it is trained on simple queries only and evaluated on complex queries, and iii) is more explainable, since the intermediate results for its sub-queries and variable assignments can be used to explain any given answer.

# 2 EXISTENTIAL POSITIVE FIRST-ORDER LOGICAL QUERIES

A Knowledge Graph  $\mathcal{G} \subseteq \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{E}$  can be defined as a set of subject-predicate-object  $\langle s, p, o \rangle$  triples, where each triple encodes a relationship of type  $p \in \mathcal{R}$  between the subject  $s \in \mathcal{E}$  and the object  $o \in \mathcal{E}$  of the triple, where  $\mathcal{E}$  and  $\mathcal{R}$  denote the set of all entities and relation types, respectively. One can think of a Knowledge Graph as a labelled multi-graph, where entities  $\mathcal{E}$  represent nodes, and edges are labelled with relation types  $\mathcal{R}$ . Without loss of generality, a Knowledge Graph can be represented as a First-Order Logic Knowledge Base, where each triple  $\langle s, p, o \rangle$  denotes an atomic formula  $p(s, o)$ , with  $p \in \mathcal{R}$  a binary predicate and  $s, o \in \mathcal{E}$  its arguments.

Conjunctive queries are a sub-class of First-Order Logical queries that use existential quantification  $(\exists)$  and conjunction  $(\land)$  operations. We consider conjunctive queries  $\mathcal{Q}$  in the following form:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {Q} [ A ] \triangleq ? A: \exists V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m}. e _ {1} \wedge \dots \wedge e _ {n} \\ \text {w h e r e} \quad e _ {i} = p (c, V), \text {w i t h} V \in \{A, V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m} \}, c \in \mathcal {E}, p \in \mathcal {R} \tag {1} \\ \begin{array}{l l} \text {o r} & e _ {i} = p (V, V ^ {\prime}), \text {w i t h} V, V ^ {\prime} \in \{A, V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m} \}, V \neq V ^ {\prime}, p \in \mathcal {R}. \end{array} \\ \end{array}
$$

In Eq. (1), the variable  $A$  is the target of the query,  $V_{1},\ldots ,V_{m}$  denote the bound variable nodes, while  $c\in \mathcal{E}$  represent the input anchor nodes. Each  $e_i$  denotes a logical atom, with either one  $(p(c,V))$  or two variables  $(p(V,V'))$ , and  $e_1\wedge \dots \wedge e_n$  denotes a conjunction between  $n$  atoms.

The goal of answering the logical query  $\mathcal{Q}$  consists in finding a set of entities  $[\mathcal{Q}]]\subseteq \mathcal{E}$  such that  $a\in [\mathcal{Q}]$  iff  $\mathcal{Q}[a]$  holds true, where  $[\mathcal{Q}]]$  is the answer set of the query  $\mathcal{Q}$ .

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the dependency graph of a conjunctive query  $\mathcal{Q}$  is a graph representation of  $\mathcal{Q}$  where nodes correspond to variable or non-variable atom arguments in  $\mathcal{Q}$  and edges correspond to atom predicates. We follow Hamilton et al. (2018) and focus on valid conjunctive queries – i.e. the dependency graph needs to be a directed acyclic graph, where anchor entities correspond to source nodes, and the query target  $A$  is the unique sink node.

Example 2.1 (Conjunctive Query). Consider the query "Which drugs interact with proteins associated with the disease  $t$ ?" This query can be formalised as a conjunctive query  $\mathcal{Q}$  such as  $?D: \exists P.\text{interacts}(D, P) \land \text{assoc}(P, t)$ , where  $t$  is an input anchor node, the variable  $D$  is the target of the query,  $P$  is a bound variable node, and the dependency graph is  $D \leftarrow P \leftarrow t$ . The answer set  $[[\mathcal{Q}]]$  of  $\mathcal{Q}$  corresponds to the set of all drugs in  $\mathcal{E}$  interacting with proteins associated with  $t$ .

Handling Disjunctions So far we focused on conjunctive queries defined using the existential quantification (∃) and conjunction (∧) logical operators. Our aim is answering a wider class of logical queries, namely Existential Positive First-Order (EPFO) queries (Dalvi & Suciu, 2004) that in addition to existential quantification and conjunction, also involve disjunction (∨). We follow Ren et al. (2020) and, without loss of generality, we transform a given EPFO query into Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF, Davey & Priestley, 2002), i.e. a disjunction of conjunctive queries.

Example 2.2 (Disjunctive Normal Form). Consider the following variant of query in Example 2.1: "Which drugs interact with proteins associated with the diseases  $t_1$  or  $t_2$ ?". This query can be formalised as a EPFO query  $\mathcal{Q}$  such as  $?D : \exists P.\text{interacts}(D, P) \land [assoc(P, t_1) \lor assoc(P, t_2)]$ . We can transform  $\mathcal{Q}$  in the following, equivalent DNF query:  $?D : \exists P.[interacts(D, P) \land assoc(P, t_1)] \lor [interacts(D, P) \land assoc(P, t_2)]$ .

In our framework, given a DNF query  $\mathcal{Q}$ , for each of its conjunctive sub-queries we produce a score for all the entities representing the likelihood that they answer that sub-query. Finally, such scores are aggregated using a t-conorm — a continuous relaxation of the logical disjunction.

# 3 COMPLEX QUERY ANSWERING VIA OPTIMISATION

We propose a framework for answering EPFO logical queries in the presence of missing edges. Given a query  $\mathcal{Q}$ , we define the score of a target node  $a \in \mathcal{E}$  as a candidate answer for a query as a function of the score of all atomic queries in  $\mathcal{Q}$ , given a variable-to-entity substitution for all variables in  $\mathcal{Q}$ .

Each variable is mapped to an embedding vector, that can either correspond to an entity  $c \in \mathcal{E}$  or to a virtual entity. The score of each of the query atoms is determined individually using a neural link predictor (Nickel et al., 2016). Then, the score of the query with respect to a given candidate answer  $\mathcal{Q}[a]$  is computed by aggregating all atom scores using t-norms and t-conorms – continuous relaxations of the logical conjunction and disjunction operators.

Neural Link Prediction A neural link predictor is a differentiable model where atom arguments are first mapped into a  $k$ -dimensional embedding space, and then used for producing a score for the atom. More formally, given a query atom  $p(s,o)$ , where  $p \in \mathcal{R}$  and  $s,o \in \mathcal{E}$ , the score for  $p(s,o)$  is computed as  $\phi_p(\mathbf{e}_s,\mathbf{e}_o)$ , where  $\mathbf{e}_s,\mathbf{e}_o \in \mathbb{R}^k$  are the embedding vectors of  $s$  and  $o$ , and  $\phi_p: \mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^k \mapsto [0,1]$  is a scoring function computing the likelihood that entities  $s$  and  $o$  are related by the relationship  $p$ .

In our experiments, as neural link predictor, we use ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) regularised using a variational approximation of the tensor nuclear  $p$ -norm proposed by Lacroix et al. (2018).

T-Norms A  $t$ -norm  $\top : [0,1] \times [0,1] \mapsto [0,1]$  is a generalisation of conjunction in logic (Klement et al., 2000; 2004). Some examples include the Gödel  $t$ -norm  $\top_{\min}(x,y) = \min\{x,y\}$ , the product  $t$ -norm  $\top_{\mathrm{prod}}(x,y) = x \cdot y$ , and the Lukasiewicz  $t$ -norm  $\top_{\mathrm{Luk}}(x,y) = \max\{0,x + y - 1\}$ . Analogously,  $t$ -conorms are dual to  $t$ -norms for disjunctions – given a  $t$ -norm  $\top$ , the complementary  $t$ -conorm is defined by  $\bot(x,y) = 1 - \top(1 - x,1 - y)$ .

Continuous Reformulation of Complex Queries Let  $\mathcal{Q}$  denote the following DNF query:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {Q} [ A ] \triangleq ? A: \exists V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m}. \left(e _ {1} ^ {1} \wedge \dots \wedge e _ {n _ {1}} ^ {1}\right) \vee .. \vee \left(e _ {1} ^ {d} \wedge \dots \wedge e _ {n _ {d}} ^ {d}\right) \\ \text {w h e r e} \quad e _ {i} ^ {j} = p (c, V), \text {w i t h} V \in \{A, V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m} \}, c \in \mathcal {E}, p \in \mathcal {R} \tag {2} \\ \text {o r} \quad e _ {i} ^ {j} = p (V, V ^ {\prime}), \text {w i t h} V, V ^ {\prime} \in \{A, V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m} \}, V \neq V ^ {\prime}, p \in \mathcal {R}. \\ \end{array}
$$

We want to know the variable assignments that render  $\mathcal{Q}$  true. To achieve this, we can cast this as an optimisation problem, where the aim is finding a mapping from variables to entities that maximises

the score of  $\mathcal{Q}$

$$
\operatorname * {a r g m a x} _ {A, V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m} \in \mathcal {E}} \left(e _ {1} ^ {1} \top \dots \top e _ {n _ {1}} ^ {1}\right) \perp .. \perp \left(e _ {1} ^ {d} \top \dots \top e _ {n _ {d}} ^ {d}\right)
$$

$$
\text {w h e r e} \quad e _ {i} ^ {j} = \phi_ {p} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {c}, \mathbf {e} _ {V}\right), \text {w i t h} V \in \{A, V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m} \}, c \in \mathcal {E}, p \in \mathcal {R} \tag {3}
$$

$$
\text {o r} \quad e _ {i} ^ {j} = \phi_ {p} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {V}, \mathbf {e} _ {V ^ {\prime}}\right), \text {w i t h} V, V ^ {\prime} \in \{A, V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m} \}, V \neq V ^ {\prime}, p \in \mathcal {R},
$$

where  $\top$  and  $\bot$  denote a t-norm and a t-conorm - a continuous generalisation of the logical conjunction and disjunction, respectively - and  $\phi_p(\mathbf{e}_s,\mathbf{e}_o)\in [0,1]$  denotes the neural link prediction score for the atom  $p(s,o)$ . We write the T-norm as an infix operator because it is associative.

Note that, in Eq. (3), the bound variable nodes  $V_{1},\ldots ,V_{m}$  are only used through their embedding vector: to compute  $\phi_p(\mathbf{e}_c,\mathbf{e}_V)$  we only use the embedding representation  $\mathbf{e}_V\in \mathbb{R}^k$ , of  $V$  and do not need to know which entity the variable  $V$  corresponds to. This means that we have two possible strategies for finding the optimal variable embeddings  $\mathbf{e}_V\in \mathbb{R}^k$  with  $V\in \{A,V_1,\dots ,V_m\}$  for maximising the objective in Eq. (3), namely continuous optimisation, where we optimise  $\mathbf{e}_V$  using gradient-based optimisation, and combinatorial optimisation, where we search for the optimal variable-to-entity assignment.

# 3.1 COMPLEX QUERY ANSWERING VIA CONTINUOUS OPTIMISATION

One way we can solve the optimisation problem in Eq. (3) is by finding the variable embeddings that maximise the score of a complex query. This can be formalised as the following continuous optimisation problem:

$$
\operatorname * {a r g   m a x} _ {\mathbf {e} _ {A}, \mathbf {e} _ {V _ {1}}, \ldots , \mathbf {e} _ {V _ {m}} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {k}} \left(e _ {1} ^ {1} \top \ldots \top e _ {n _ {1}} ^ {1}\right) \perp .. \perp \left(e _ {1} ^ {d} \top \ldots \top e _ {n _ {d}} ^ {d}\right)
$$

$$
\text {w h e r e} \quad e _ {i} ^ {j} = \phi_ {p} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {c}, \mathbf {e} _ {V}\right), \text {w i t h} V \in \{A, V _ {1}, \dots , V _ {m} \}, c \in \mathcal {E}, p \in \mathcal {R} \tag {4}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r l} \text {o r} & e _ {i} ^ {j} = \phi_ {p} (\mathbf {e} _ {V}, \mathbf {e} _ {V ^ {\prime}}), \text {w i t h} V, V ^ {\prime} \in \{A, V _ {1}, \ldots , V _ {m} \}, V \neq V ^ {\prime}, p \in \mathcal {R}. \end{array}
$$

In Eq. (4) we directly optimise the embedding representations  $\mathbf{e}_A, \mathbf{e}_{V_1}, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_{V_m} \in \mathbb{R}^k$  of variables  $A, V_1, \ldots, V_m$ , rather than exploring the combinatorial space of variable-to-entity mappings. In this way, we can tackle the maximisation problem in Eq. (4) using gradient-based optimisation methods, such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015). Then, after we identified the optimal representation for variables  $A, V_1, \ldots, V_m$ , we replace the query target embedding  $\mathbf{e}_A$  with the embedding representations  $\mathbf{e}_c \in \mathbb{R}^k$  of all entities  $c \in \mathcal{E}$ , and use the resulting complex query score to compute the likelihood that such entities answer the query.

# 3.2 COMPLEX QUERY ANSWERING VIA COMBINATORIAL OPTIMISATION

Another way we tackle the optimisation problem in Eq. (3) is by greedily searching for a set of variable substitutions  $S = \{A \gets a, V_1 \gets v_1, \dots, V_m \gets v_m\}$ , with  $a, v_1, \dots, v_m \in \mathcal{E}$ , that maximises the complex query score, in a procedure akin to beam search. We do so by traversing the dependency graph of a query  $\mathcal{Q}$  and, whenever we find an atom in the form  $p(c, V)$ , where  $p \in \mathcal{R}$ ,  $c$  is either an entity or a variable for which we already have a substitution, and  $V$  is a variable for which we do not have a substitution yet, we replace  $V$  with all entities in  $\mathcal{E}$  and retain the top- $k$  entities  $t \in \mathcal{E}$  that maximise  $\phi_p(\mathbf{e}_c, \mathbf{e}_t)$  - i.e. the most likely entities to appear as a substitution of  $V$  according to the neural link predictor.

Our procedure is akin to beam search: as we traverse the dependency graph of a query, we keep a beam with the most promising variable-to-entity substitutions identified so far.

Example 3.1 (Combinatorial Optimisation). Consider the query "Which drugs  $D$  interact with proteins associated with disease  $t$ ?" can be rewritten as:  $?D : \exists P.\text{interacts}(D, P) \land \text{assoc}(P, t)$ . In order to answer this query via combinatorial optimisation, we first find the top-  $k$  proteins  $p$  that are most likely to substitute the variable  $P$  in  $\text{assoc}(P, t)$ . Then, we search for the top-  $k$  drugs  $d$  that are most likely to substitute  $D$  in  $\text{interacts}(D, P)$ , ending up with at most  $k^2$  candidate drugs. Finally, we rank the candidate drugs  $d$  by using the query score produced by the  $t$ -norm.

Note that scoring all possible entities can be done efficiently and in a single step on a GPU by replacing  $V$  with the entity embedding matrix. In our experiments we did not notice any computational

bottlenecks due to the branching factors of longer queries. However, that could be handled by using alternate graph exploration strategies.

# 4 RELATED WORK

This work is closely related to approaches for learning to traverse Knowledge Graphs (Guu et al., 2015; Das et al., 2017; 2018), and more recent works on answering conjunctive queries via black-box neural models trained on generated queries (Hamilton et al., 2018; Daza & Cochez, 2020). The main difference is that we propose a tractable framework for handling a substantially larger subset of First-Order Logic queries.

More recently, Ren et al. (2020) proposed Query2Box, a neural model for Existential Positive First-Order logical queries, where queries are represented via box embeddings (Li et al., 2019). Such approaches for query answering require a dataset with millions of generated queries to generalise well – for instance, on the FB15k-237 dataset, approx.  $15 \times 10^{4}$  training queries for each query type are used, resulting in approx.  $1.2 \times 10^{6}$  training queries. Our framework, on the other hand, only uses a simple, state-of-the-art neural link predictor (Lacroix et al., 2018) trained on a set of 1-hop queries that is orders of magnitude smaller.

There is a large body of work on neural link predictors, that learn embeddings of entities and relations in KGs via a simple link prediction training objective (Bordes et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015; Trouillon et al., 2016; Lacroix et al., 2018). Due to their design, they are often evaluated for answering 1-hop queries only, as their application to more complex queries does not derive directly from their formulation.

Previous work has considered using such embeddings for complex query answering (Wang et al., 2018), by partitioning the query graph and using an ad-hoc aggregation function to score candidate answers. In contrast, our proposed method answers a query by using a single pass where aggregation steps are implemented with t-norms and t-conorms, which are continuous relaxations of conjunctions and disjunctions. Such t-norms have been proposed as differentiable formulations of logical operators suitable for gradient-based learning (Serafini & d'Avila Garcez, 2016; Guo et al., 2016; Minervini et al., 2017; van Krieken et al., 2020).

Further alternatives for using embeddings from neural link predictors, such as combinatorial optimisation, have been ruled out as unfeasible (Hamilton et al., 2018; Daza & Cochez, 2020). We show that this approach can scale well by reducing the set of possible intermediate answers, while outperforming the state-of-the-art in query answering.

The framework proposed in this paper is related to neural theorem provers (Rocktäschel & Riedel, 2017; Minervini et al., 2020a;b), a differentiable relaxation of the backward-chaining reasoning algorithm where comparison between symbols is replaced by a differentiable similarity function between their embedding vectors. During the reasoning process, neural theorem provers check which rules can be used for proving a given atomic query. Then it is checked whether the premise of such rules is satisfied, where the premise is a conjunctive query. The procedure they use for answering conjunctions is akin to the combinatorial optimisation procedure we propose in subsection 3.2. The main source of difference is how atomic queries are answered - we use the ComplEx neural link predictor (Trouillon et al., 2016), while neural theorem provers use the maximum similarity value between a given atomic query and all facts in the Knowledge Graph, which has linear complexity in the number of triples in the graph.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

We have described a method to answer a query by decomposing it into a continuous formulation, which we refer to as Continuous Query Decomposition (CQD). In this section we demonstrate the effectiveness of CQD for query answering, comprising experimental results for continuous optimisation (CQD-CO) and beam search (CQD-Beam). We also provide a qualitative analysis of how our method can be used to obtain explanations for a given complex query answer.

(2020) – the naming of each query structure corresponds to projection (p), intersection (i), and union (u), and reflects how they were implemented in the Query2Box model (Ren et al., 2020). An example of a "pi" query is  $?T : \exists T, V.p(a, V), q(V, T), r(b, T)$ , where  $a$  and  $b$  are anchor nodes,  $V$  is a variable node, and  $T$  is the query target node.

# 5.1 DATASETS

We make use of knowledge graphs used in the literature of link prediction and query answering. FB15k (Bordes et al., 2013) and FB15k-237 (Toutanova & Chen, 2015) are based on a subset of the Freebase knowledge graph and contain general facts. The NELL995 dataset (Xiong et al., 2017) is obtained from the NELL system (Mitchell et al., 2015), and aims to evaluate models for knowledge base completion that require multi-hop reasoning. In order to compare with previous work on query answering, we use the queries generated by Ren et al. (2020) from these datasets. Dataset statistics are detailed in Table 1. We consider a total of 9 query types, including queries that require 1-hop link prediction, and 2 queries that contain disjunctions - different query types are illustrated in Fig. 2. Note that in our framework, we only make use of type 1-chain queries to train the neural link predictor, while the evaluation is carried out with the complete set of query types.

# 5.2 MODEL DETAILS

To obtain embeddings for the query answering task, we use ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) a variational approximation of the nuclear tensor  $p$ -norm for regularisation (Lacroix et al., 2018). For FB15k and FB15k-237, we use the best set of hyperparameters identified by Lacroix et al. (2018) on held-out validation sets. For NELL995, we carry out hyperparameter optimisation with the validation set to select the best batch size and regularisation coefficient, with a fixed learning rate of 0.1. In all cases, we use a rank of 500.

For query answering we experimented with the Gödel and product t-norms and t-conorms. According to the validation set, we observed that the product t-norm and t-conorm resulted in the best performance.

For CQD-CO, we optimise variable and target embeddings with Adam, using the same initialization scheme as Lacroix et al. (2018), with a learning rate of 0.1 and a maximum of 1,000 iterations. In practice, we observed that the procedure converges in less than 300 iterations. For CQD-Beam, we use a beam size of  $k = 3$ .

# 5.3 EVALUATION

Similarly as for link prediction models (Bordes et al., 2013), we employ a ranking procedure to evaluate the query answering performance of our method. For each test query, we assign a score to every entity in the graph. We evaluate the Hits-at-3 metric  $(\mathrm{H}@\mathrm{3})$ , which for a given query has a

value of 1 if the correct entity is in the top-3 of entities, sorted by score in descending order. Since a query can have multiple answers, we implement a filtered setting, whereby for a given answer, we filter out other correct answers from the ranking before computing H@3.

As baselines we consider Graph Query Embedding (GQE, Hamilton et al., 2018) and Query2Box (Q2B, Ren et al., 2020), which follow the same described evaluation protocol. These are black-box neural models where embeddings have a dimension of 400, that were trained with large datasets containing all the query types that we evaluate on.

# 5.4 RESULTS

We detail the results of  $\mathrm{H}@\mathfrak{z}$  for all different query types, and on average, in Table 2.

We observe that on average, CQD outperforms the GQE and Q2B baselines, while using orders of magnitude less training data containing one type of query only. This constitutes strong evidence about the out-of-distribution generalisation of embeddings trained for link prediction. In particular, combinatorial optimisation in CQD-Beam consistently outperforms the baselines across all datasets. The relative improvements over the best baseline are  $23\%$  in FB15k,  $7\%$  in FB15k-237, and  $16\%$  in NELL995. This demonstrates that the low value of  $k = 3$  used during beam search is enough to obtain competitive results. CQD-CO outperforms the baselines with a relative improvement of  $12\%$  in FB15k and  $6\%$  in NELL995.

The results for chain-like queries show that CQD-Beam is effective, even when increasing the length of the chain. The most difficult case corresponds to 3p queries, where the number of candidate variable substitutions increases due to the branching factor of the search procedure. We further increased the number of candidates to  $k = 5$  and obtained a result of  $0.306\mathrm{H}@\mathrm{3}$  for this type of query on NELL. This amounts to a  $31\%$  relative increase over the best baseline and demonstrates how the performance of CQD-Beam can be further improved by increasing the size of the beam during the search process.

We also note that having more variables does not always translate into worse performance for CQD-CO: in FB15k-237 and NELL995, it yields the best ranking scores for  $ip$  and  $pi$  queries, which contain two variables.

Table 3: Intermediate variable assignments and scores for an example query, obtained with CQD-Beam. Values in bold indicate the highest score for each different organisation  $o$  .

Interestingly, the performance of Q2B is higher for 1-chain queries that require simple link prediction. This indicates that a training procedure that includes queries of diverse types acts as a form of data augmentation that boosts link prediction performance.

# 5.5 EXPLAINING ANSWERS TO COMPLEX QUERIES

A useful property of our framework is its transparency when computing scores for distinct atoms in a query. Unlike black-box neural models that encode a query into a vector, our framework is able to produce explanations at each step when answering a query, regardless of its complexity; we now show how this can be achieved.

Consider the following test query from the FB15k-237 knowledge graph: What international organisations contain the country of nationality of Thomas Aquinas? This query can be formalised as the following conjunctive query:  $?O : \exists C$ .nationality(TA,  $C$ ) ∧ memberOf(  $C, O$  ), where TA represents Thomas Aquinas.

The ground-truth answers to this query are the OECD, the EU, NATO, and the WTO. CQD-Beam correctly produces the following answers in the top-3: NATO, OECD, and the EU. We can further inspect the scores and intermediate assignments to the variable  $C$  in the query that led to these answers, as shown in Table 3.

In the last column, we have highlighted in bold the highest score for each organisation, which are the output scores that CQD produces for each candidate entity. We note that this ranking is the result of selecting the three countries in the first column as the top-3 candidates for the nationality of Thomas Aquinas. Even though this selection contains two European countries and it ultimately leads to correct answers, it does not contain Italy, which is the correct nationality. By inspecting these decisions we can thus identify failure modes of our framework, even when it produces seemingly correct answers.

# 6 CONCLUSIONS

We proposed a framework — Complex Query Decomposition (CQD) — for answering Existential Positive First-Order logical queries by reasoning over sets of entities in embedding space. In our framework, answering a complex query is reduced to answering each of its sub-queries, and aggregating the resulting scores via t-norms. The benefit of the method is that we only need to train a neural link prediction model on atomic queries to use our framework for answering a given complex query, without the need of training on millions of generated complex queries. This comes with the added value that we are able to explain each step of the query answering process regardless of query complexity, instead of using a black-box neural query embedding model. The proposed method is agnostic to the type of query, and is able to generalise without explicitly training on a specific variety of queries. Experimental results show that CQD produces significantly more accurate results than current state-of-the-art complex query answering methods on incomplete Knowledge Graphs.
