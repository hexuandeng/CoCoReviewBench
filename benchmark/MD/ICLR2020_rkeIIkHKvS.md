# ABSTRACT

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used for representation learning on graph data. However, there is limited understanding on how much performance GNNs actually gain from graph data. This paper introduces a context-surrounding GNN framework and proposes two smoothness metrics to measure the quantity and quality of information obtained from graph data. A new GNN model, called CS-GNN, is then designed to improve the use of graph information based on the smoothness values of a graph. CS-GNN is shown to achieve better performance than existing methods in different types of real graphs.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Graphs are powerful data structures that allow us to easily express various relationships (i.e., edges) between objects (i.e., nodes). In recent years, extensive studies have been conducted on GNNs, which utilize the relationship information in graph data for various tasks such as node classification, link predication, and graph isomorphism test, and significant performance improvements over traditional methods have been achieved on benchmark datasets (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017; Velickovic et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019). Such breakthrough results have led to the exploration of using GNNs and their variants different areas such as computer vision (Satorras & Estrach, 2018; Marino et al., 2017), natural language processing (Peng et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2019), chemistry (Duvenaud et al., 2015), biology (Fout et al., 2017), and social networks (Wang et al., 2018). Thus, understanding why GNNs can outperform traditional methods that are designed for Euclidean data is important, which can help analyze the performance of existing GNN models and develop new GNN models for different types of graphs.

Intuitively, one main reason why GNNs outperform existing Euclidean-based methods is because rich information about the neighborhood of an object can be captured. GNNs collect neighborhood information with aggregators (Zhou et al., 2018), such as the mean aggregator that takes the mean value of neighbors' feature vectors (Hamilton et al., 2017), the sum aggregator that applies summation (Duvenaud et al., 2015), and the attention aggregator that takes the weighted sum value (Velickovic et al., 2018). Then, the aggregated vector and a node's own feature vector are combined and transformed as the new feature vector. After some rounds, the feature vectors of nodes can be used for tasks such as node classification. Thus, the performance improvement brought by graph data is highly related to the quantity and quality of the neighborhood information. In this paper, we propose a context-surrounding framework to quantify the information gain and analyze the quality of the neighborhood information of nodes. In addition, we also introduce two smoothness metrics on node features and labels to measure the information gain's quantity and quality, which can also be used to analyze the performance improvements of GNNs over Euclidean methods.

In practice, not all neighbors of a node contain relevant information w.r.t. a specific task. Thus, neighborhood provides both positive information and negative disturbance for a given task. Simply aggregating the feature vectors of neighbors with manually-picked aggregators (i.e., users choose a type of aggregator for different graphs and tasks by trial or by experience) often cannot achieve optimal performance. Therefore, it would be more desirable if we can design an effective strategy that can selectively aggregate neighborhood information to amplify useful information and reduce negative disturbance. The attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate neighbors with weights (or coefficients) in Velickovic et al. (2018); Zhang et al. (2018b). However, existing attention mechanisms do not make use of rich side information (e.g., node/edge attributes, local topology features)

contained in graph data. To address the limitations of existing GNN models, we propose CS-GNN based on our context-surrounding framework. CS-GNN utilizes the feature and label smoothness of a graph to improve the gain of positive information and reduce negative noisy information from the neighborhood. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of our two smoothness measures and the performance improvements obtained by CS-GNN over existing methods.

# 2 MEASURING THE USEFULNESS OF NEIGHBORHOOD INFORMATION

We first introduce a general GNN framework and three representative GNN models. Then we propose a context-surrounding framework and two smoothness metrics to measure the quantity and quality of the information that nodes can obtain from their neighbors.

# 2.1 GNN FRAMEWORK AND MODELS

The notations used in this paper, together with their descriptions, are listed in Appendix A. We use  $\mathcal{G} = \{\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}\}$  to denote a graph, where  $\mathcal{V}$  and  $\mathcal{E}$  represent the set of nodes and edges of  $\mathcal{G}$ . We use  $e_{v,v^{\prime}}\in \mathcal{E}$  to denote the edge that connects nodes  $v$  and  $v^{\prime}$ , and  $\mathcal{N}_v = \{v':e_{v,v'}\in \mathcal{E}\}$  to denote the set of neighbors of a node  $v\in \mathcal{V}$ . Each node  $v\in \mathcal{V}$  has a feature vector  $x_{v}\in \mathcal{X}$  with dimension  $d$ . Consider a node classification task, for each node  $v\in \mathcal{V}$  with a class label  $y_{v}$ , the goal is to learn a representation vector  $h_v$  and a mapping function  $f(\cdot)$  to predict the class label  $y_{v}$  of node  $v$ , i.e.,  $\hat{y}_v = f(h_v)$  where  $\hat{y}_v$  is the predicted label.

GNNs are inspired by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test (Weisfeiler & Lehman, 1968; Shervashidze et al., 2011), which is an effective method for graph isomorphism. In a similar way, GNNs utilize a neighborhood aggregation scheme to learn a representation vector  $h_v$  for each node  $v$ , and then use neural networks to learn a mapping function  $f(\cdot)$ . Formally, consider the general GNN framework (Hamilton et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019) in Table 1 with  $K$  rounds of neighbor aggregation. In each round, only the features of 1-hop neighbors are aggregated, and the framework consists of two functions, AGGREGATE and COMBINE. We initialize  $h_v^{(0)} = x_v$ . After  $K$  rounds of aggregation, each node  $v \in \mathcal{V}$  obtains its representation vector  $h_v^{(K)}$ . We use  $h_v^{(K)}$  and a mapping function  $f(\cdot)$ , e.g., a fully connected layer, to obtain the final results for a specific task such as node classification.

Many GNN models have been proposed. We introduce three representative ones: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) (Velickovic et al., 2018). GCN merges the combination and aggregation functions, as shown in Table 1, where  $A(\cdot)$  represents the activation function and  $W$  is a learnable parameter matrix. Different from GCN, GraphSAGE uses concatenation  $||$  as the combination function, which can better preserve a node's own information. Different aggregators (e.g., mean, max pooling) are provided in GraphSAGE. However, GraphSAGE requires users to choose an aggregator to use for different graphs and tasks, which may lead to sub-optimal performance. GAT addresses this problem by an attention mechanism that learns coefficients of neighbors for aggregation. With the learned coefficients  $a_{i,j}^{(k-1)}$  on all the edges (including self-loops), GAT aggregates neighbors with a weighted sum aggregator. The attention mechanism can learn coefficients of neighbors in different graphs and achieves significant improvements over prior GNN models.

# 2.2 A CONTEXT-SURROUNDING FRAMEWORK AND SMOOTHNESS METRICS

The general GNN framework can be interpreted as two steps: using an aggregation function to aggregate the features of neighbors as the surrounding information, and then using a combination function to combine a node's own features with the surrounding information. If we regard the context  $c_v$  of a node  $v$  as the node's own information, then naturally we can use the representation vector  $h_v$  in Table 1 as  $c_v$ , though  $c_v$  can contain more information about  $v$  than just its representation vector. Similarly, we use  $s_v$  to denote the surrounding of  $v$ , which represents the aggregated feature vector computed from  $v$ 's neighbors. Since the neighborhood aggregation can be seen as a convolution operation on a graph (Defferrard et al., 2016), we generalize the aggregator as weight linear combination, which can be used to express most existing aggregators. Then, we can re-formulate the general GNN framework as a context-surrounding framework with two mapping functions  $f_1(\cdot)$  and  $f_2(\cdot)$  in round  $k$  as:

$$
c _ {v _ {i}} ^ {(k)} = f _ {1} \left(c _ {v _ {i}} ^ {(k - 1)}, s _ {v _ {i}} ^ {(k - 1)}\right), \quad s _ {v _ {i}} ^ {(k - 1)} = f _ {2} \left(\sum_ {v _ {j} \in \mathcal {N} _ {v _ {i}}} a _ {i, j} ^ {(k - 1)} \cdot c _ {v _ {j}} ^ {(k - 1)}\right). \tag {1}
$$

From equation (1), the key difference between GNNs and traditional neural-network-based methods for Euclidean data is that GNNs can integrate extra information from the surrounding of a node into its context. In graph signal processing (Ortega et al., 2018), features on nodes are regarded as signals and it is common to assume that observations contain both noises and true signals in a standard signal processing problem (Rabiner & Gold, 1975). Thus, we can decompose a context vector into two parts as  $c_{v_i}^{(k)} = \check{c}_{v_i}^{(k)} + \check{n}_{v_i}^{(k)}$ , where  $\check{c}_{v_i}^{(k)}$  is the true signal and  $\check{n}_{v_i}^{(k)}$  is the noise.

Theorem 1. Assume that the noise  $\check{n}_{v_i}^{(k)}$  follows the same distribution for all nodes. If the noise power of  $\check{n}_{v_i}^{(k)}$  is defined by its variance  $\sigma^2$ , then the noise power of the surrounding input  $\sum_{v_j\in \mathcal{N}_{v_i}}a_{i,j}^{(k - 1)}\cdot c_{v_j}^{(k - 1)}$  is  $\sum_{v_j\in \mathcal{N}_{v_i}}(a_{i,j}^{(k - 1)})^2\cdot \sigma^2$ .

The proof can be found in Appendix B. Theorem 1 shows that the surrounding input has less noise power than the context when a proper aggregator (i.e., coefficient  $a_{i,j}^{(k-1)}$ ) is used. Specifically, the mean aggregator has the best denoising performance and the pooling aggregator (e.g., max-pooling) cannot reduce the noise power. For the sum aggregator, where all coefficients are equal to 1, the noise power of the surrounding input is larger than that of the context.

We first analyze the information gain from the surrounding without considering the noise. In the extreme case when the context is the same as the surrounding input, the surrounding input contributes no extra information to the context. To quantify the information obtained from the surrounding, we present the following definition based on information theory.

Definition 2 (Information Gain from Surrounding). For normalized feature space  $\mathcal{X}_k = [0,1]^{d_k}$ , if  $\sum_{v_j\in \mathcal{N}_{v_i}}a_{i,j}^{(k)} = 1$ , the feature space of  $\sum_{v_j\in \mathcal{N}_{v_i}}a_{i,j}^{(k)}\cdot \check{c}_{v_j}^{(k)}$  is also in  $\mathcal{X}_k = [0,1]^{d_k}$ . The probability density function (PDF) of  $\check{c}_{v_j}^{(k)}$  over  $\mathcal{X}_k$  is defined as  $C^{(k)}$ , which is the ground truth and can be estimated by nonparametric methods with a set of samples, where each sample point  $\check{c}_{v_i}^{(k)}$  is sampled with probability  $|\mathcal{N}_{v_i}| / 2|\mathcal{E}|$ . Correspondingly, the PDF of  $\sum_{v_j\in \mathcal{N}_{v_i}}a_{i,j}^{(k)}\cdot \check{c}_{v_j}^{(k)}$  is  $S^{(k)}$ , which can be estimated with a set of samples  $\{\sum_{v_j\in \mathcal{N}_{v_i}}a_{i,j}^{(k)}\cdot \check{c}_{v_j}^{(k)}\}$ , where each point is sampled with probability  $|\mathcal{N}_{v_i}| / 2|\mathcal{E}|$ . The information gain from the surrounding in round  $k$  can be computed by Kullback-Leibler divergence (Kullback & Leibler, 1951) as

$$
D _ {K L} (S ^ {(k)} | | C ^ {(k)}) = \int_ {\mathcal {X} _ {k}} S ^ {(k)} (\boldsymbol {x}) \cdot \log \frac {S ^ {(k)} (\boldsymbol {x})}{C ^ {(k)} (\boldsymbol {x})} d \boldsymbol {x}.
$$

The Kullback-Leibler divergence is a measure of information loss when the context distribution is used to approximate the surrounding distribution (Kurt, 2017). Thus, we can use the divergence to measure the information gain from the surrounding into the context of a node. When all the context vectors are equal to their surrounding inputs, the distribution of the context is totally the same with that of the surrounding. In this case, the divergence is equal to 0, which means that there is no extra information that the context can obtain from the surrounding. On the other hand, if the context and the surrounding of a node have different distributions, the divergence value is strictly positive. Note

that in practice, the ground-truth distributions of the context and surrounding signals are unknown. In addition, for learnable aggregators, e.g., the attention aggregator, the coefficients are unknown. Thus, we propose a metric  $\lambda_{f}$  to estimate the divergence. Graph smoothness (Zhou & Scholkopf, 2004) is an effective measure of the signal frequency in graph signal processing (Rabiner & Gold, 1975). Inspired by that, we define the feature smoothness on a graph.

Definition 3 (Feature Smoothness). Consider the condition of the first round, where  $c_v^{(0)} = x_v$ , we define the feature smoothness  $\lambda_f$  over normalized space  $\mathcal{X} = [0,1]^d$  as

$$
\lambda_ {f} = \frac {\left| \left| \sum_ {v \in \mathcal {V}} \left(\sum_ {v ^ {\prime} \in \mathcal {N} _ {v}} (x _ {v} - x _ {v ^ {\prime}})\right) ^ {2} \right| \right| _ {1}}{| \mathcal {E} | \cdot d},
$$

where  $||\cdot ||_1$  is the Manhattan norm.

According to Definition 3, a larger  $\lambda_{f}$  indicates that the feature signal of a graph has higher frequency, meaning that the feature vectors  $x_{v}$  and  $x_{v^{\prime}}$  are more likely dissimilar for two connected nodes  $v$  and  $v^{\prime}$  in the graph. In other words, nodes with dissimilar features tend to be connected. Intuitively, for a graph whose feature sets have high frequency, the context of a node can obtain more information gain from its surrounding, since the PDFs (given in Definition 2) of the context and the surrounding have the same probability but fall in different places in space  $\mathcal{X}$ . Formally, we state the relation between  $\lambda_{f}$  and the information gain from the surrounding in the following theorem. For simplicity, we let  $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{X}_0$ ,  $d = d_0$ ,  $C = C^{(0)}$  and  $S = S^{(0)}$ .

Theorem 4. For a graph  $\mathcal{G}$  with the set of features  $\mathcal{X}$  in space  $[0,1]^d$  and using the mean aggregator, the information gain from the surrounding  $D_{KL}(S||C)$  is positively correlated to its feature smoothness  $\lambda_f$ , i.e.,  $D_{KL}(S||C) \sim \lambda_f$ . In particular,  $D_{KL}(S||C) = 0$  when  $\lambda_f = 0$ .

The proof can be found in Appendix C. According to Theorem 4, a large  $\lambda_{f}$  means that a GNN model can obtain much information from graph data. Note that  $D_{KL}(S||C)$  here is under the condition when using the mean aggregator. Others aggregators, e.g., pooling and weight could have different  $D_{KL}(S||C)$  values, even if the feature smoothness  $\lambda_{f}$  is a constant.

After quantifying the information gain with  $\lambda_{f}$ , we next study how to measure the effectiveness of information gain. Consider the node classification task, where each node  $v\in \mathcal{V}$  has a label  $y_{v}$ , we define  $v_{i}\simeq v_{j}$  if  $y_{v_i} = y_{v_j}$ . The surrounding input can be decomposed into two parts based on the node labels as

$$
\sum_ {v _ {j} \in \mathcal {N} _ {v _ {i}}} a _ {i, j} ^ {(k - 1)} \check {c} _ {v _ {j}} ^ {(k - 1)} = \sum_ {v _ {j} \in \mathcal {N} _ {v _ {i}}} \mathbb {I} (v _ {i} \simeq v _ {j}) a _ {i, j} ^ {(k - 1)} \check {c} _ {v _ {j}} ^ {(k - 1)} + \sum_ {v _ {j} \in \mathcal {N} _ {v _ {i}}} (1 - \mathbb {I} (v _ {i} \simeq v _ {j})) a _ {i, j} ^ {(k - 1)} \check {c} _ {v _ {j}} ^ {(k - 1)},
$$

where  $\mathbb{I}(\cdot)$  is an indicator function. The first term includes neighbors whose label  $y_{v_j}$  is the same as  $y_{v_i}$ , and the second term represents neighbors that have different labels. Assume that the classifier has good linearity, the label of the surrounding input is shifted to  $\sum_{v_j\in \mathcal{N}_{v_i}}a_{i,j}^{(k - 1)}\cdot y_{v_j}$  (Zhang et al., 2018a), where the label  $y_{v_j}$  is represented as a one-hot vector here. Note that in GNNs, even if the context and surrounding of  $v_i$  are combined, the label of  $v_i$  is still  $y_{v_i}$ . Thus, for the node classification task, it is reasonable to consider that neighbors with the same label contribute positive information and other neighbors contribute negative disturbance.

Definition 5 (Label Smoothness). To measure the quality of surrounding information, we define the label smoothness as

$$
\lambda_ {l} = \sum_ {e _ {v _ {i}, v _ {j}} \in \mathcal {E}} \left(1 - \mathbb {I} (v _ {i} \simeq v _ {j})\right) / | \mathcal {E} |.
$$

According to Definition 5, a larger  $\lambda_{l}$  implies that nodes with different labels tend to be connected together, in which case the surrounding contributes more negative disturbance for the task. In other words, a small  $\lambda_{l}$  means that a node can gain much positive information from its surrounding. To use  $\lambda_{l}$  to qualify the surrounding information, we require labeled data for the training. When some graphs do not have many labeled nodes, we may use a subset of labeled data to estimate  $\lambda_{l}$ , which is often sufficient for obtaining good results as we show for the BGP dataset used in our experiments.

In summary, we propose a context-surrounding framework, and introduce two smoothness metrics to estimate how much information that the surrounding can provide (i.e., larger  $\lambda_{f}$  means more information) and how much information is useful (i.e., smaller  $\lambda_{l}$  means more positive information) for a given task on a given graph.

# 3 CONTEXT-SURROUNDING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS

In this section, we present a new GNN model, called CS-GNN, which utilizes the two smoothness metrics to improve the use of the information from the surrounding.

# 3.1 THE USE OF SMOOTHNESS FOR CONTEXT-SURROUNDING GNNS

The aggregator used in CS-GNN is weighted sum and the combination function is concatenation. To compute the coefficients for each of the  $K$  rounds, we use a multiplicative attention mechanism similar to Vaswani et al. (2017). We obtain  $2|\mathcal{E}|$  attention coefficients by multiplying the leveraged representation vector of each neighbor of a node with the node's context vector, and applying the softmax normalization. Formally, each coefficient  $a_{i,j}^{(k)}$  in round  $k$  is defined as follows:

$$
a _ {i, j} ^ {(k)} = \frac {\exp \left(A \left(p _ {v _ {i}} ^ {(k)} \cdot q _ {i , j} ^ {(k)}\right)\right)}{\sum_ {v _ {l} \in \mathcal {N} _ {v _ {i}}} \exp \left(A \left(p _ {v _ {i}} ^ {(k)} \cdot q _ {i , l} ^ {(k)}\right)\right)}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $p_{v_i}^{(k)} = (W_p^{(k)} \cdot h_{v_i}^{(k)})^\top$ ,  $q_{i,j}^{(k)} = p_{v_i}^{(k)} - W_q^{(k)} \cdot h_{v_j}^{(k)}$ ,  $W_p^{(k)}$  and  $W_q^{(k)}$  are two learnable matrices.

To improve the use of the surrounding information, we utilize feature and label smoothness as follows. First, we use  $\lambda_{l}$  to drop neighbors with negative information, i.e., we set  $a_{i,j}^{(k)} = 0$  if  $a_{i,j}^{(k)}$  is less than the value of the  $r$ -th ( $r = \lceil 2|\mathcal{E}|\lambda_l\rceil$ ) smallest attention coefficient. As these neighbors contain noisy disturbance to the task, dropping them is helpful to retain a node's own features.

Second, as  $\lambda_{f}$  is used to estimate the quantity of information gain, we use it to set the dimension of a context vector as  $\lceil d_k\cdot \sqrt{\lambda_f}\rceil$ , which is obtained empirically to achieve good performance. Setting the appropriate dimension is important because a large dimension causes the attention mechanism to fluctuate while a small one limits its expressive power.

Third, in contrast to existing graph attention networks (Velickovic et al., 2018), which use the leveraged representation vector  $W^{(k)} \cdot h_{v_j}^{(k)}$  to compute the attention coefficients, in equation (2) we use  $q_{i,j}^{(k)}$ , which is the difference of the context vector of node  $v_i$  and the leveraged representation vector of neighbor  $v_j$ . The definition of  $q_{i,j}^{(k)}$  is inspired by the fact that a larger  $\lambda_f$  indicates that the features of a node and its neighbor are more dissimilar, meaning that the neighbor can contribute greater information gain. Thus, using  $q_{i,j}^{(k)}$ , we obtain a larger/smaller  $a_{i,j}^{(k)}$  when the features of  $v_i$  and its neighbor  $v_j$  are more dissimilar/similar. For example, if the features of a node and its neighbors are very similar, then  $q_{i,j}^{(k)}$  is small and hence  $a_{i,j}^{(k)}$  is also small.

Using the attention coefficients, we perform  $K$  rounds of aggregations with the weighted sum aggregator to obtain the representation vectors for each node as

$$
h _ {v _ {i}} ^ {(k)} = A \Big (W _ {l} ^ {(k)} \cdot \big (h _ {v _ {i}} ^ {(k - 1)} \big | \big | \sum_ {v _ {j} \in \mathcal {N} _ {v _ {i}}} a _ {i, j} ^ {(k - 1)} \cdot h _ {v _ {j}} ^ {(k - 1)} \big) \Big),
$$

where  $W_{l}^{(k)}$  is a learnable parameter matrix to leverage feature vectors. Then, for a task such as node classification, we use a fully connected layer to obtain the final results  $\hat{y}_{v_i} = A(W\cdot h_{v_i}^{(K)})$ , where  $W$  is a learnable parameter matrix and  $\hat{y}_{v_i}$  is the predicted classification result of node  $v_{i}$ .

# 3.2 SIDE INFORMATION ON GRAPHS

Real-world graphs often contain side information such as attributes on both nodes and edges, local topology features and edge direction. We show that CS-GNN can be easily extended to include rich side information to improve performance. Generally speaking, side information can be divided into two types: context and surrounding. Usually, the side information attached on nodes belongs to the context and that on edges or neighbors belongs to the surrounding. To incorporate the side information into our CS-GNN model, we use the local topology features as an example.

One of the simplest type of local topology features is the number of neighbors (Ribeiro et al., 2017). But there are other local topology features that contain much richer information, e.g.,  $K$ -hop neighborhood of a node and cliques containing a node. To capture these complex features, we use a

method inspired by GraphWave (Donnat et al., 2018), which uses heat kernel in spectral graph wavelets to simulate heat diffusion characteristics as topology features. Specifically, we construct  $|\mathcal{V}|$  subgraphs,  $\mathbb{G} = \{G_{v_1}, G_{v_2}, \ldots, G_{v_{|\mathcal{V}|}}\}$ , from a graph  $\mathcal{G} = \{\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}\}$ , where  $G_{v_i}$  is composed of  $v$  and its neighbors within  $K$  hops (usually  $K$  is small,  $K = 2$  as default in our algorithm), as well as the connecting edges. For each  $G_{v_i} \in \mathbb{G}$ , the local topology feature vector  $t_{v_i}$  of node  $v_i$  is obtained by a method similar to GraphWave.

Since the topology feature vector  $t_{v_i}$  itself does not change during neighborhood aggregation, we do not merge it into the representation vector. We use  $t_{v_i}$  in the last fully connected layer to obtain the predicted class label  $\hat{y}_{v_i} = A(W \cdot (h_{v_i}^{(K)}||t_{v_i}))$ . But in the attention mechanism, we regard  $t_{v_i}$  as a part of the context information, by incorporating it into  $p_{v_i}^{(k)} = (W_p^{(k)} \cdot (h_{v_i}^{(k)}||t_{v_i}))^\top$ .

# 3.3 COMPARISON WITH EXISTING GNN MODELS

We also analyze the major differences between CS-GNN and representative GNN models shown in Table 1. Let us consider the combination function and aggregation function used in these models. GCN and GAT use additive combination merged with aggregation, where the features of each node are aggregated with the features of its neighbors. GraphSAGE and CS-GNN use concatenation as the combination function, where the feature vector of each node is concatenated to the aggregated feature vector of its neighbors. The difference between additive combination and concatenation is that concatenation can retain a node's own feature. Different from GCN and GraphSAGE, GAT and CS-GNN improve the performance of a task on a given graph by an attention mechanism to learn the coefficients. Compared with GAT, CS-GNN's attention mechanism utilizes feature smoothness and label smoothness to improve the use of neighborhood information as discussed in Section 3.1. In addition, CS-GNN is also more flexible in the use of side information as discussed in Section 3.2.

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

We first compare CS-GNN with representative methods on the node classification task. Then we evaluate the effects of different feature smoothness and label smoothness on the performance of neural networks-based methods.

# 4.1 BASELINE METHODS, DATASETS, AND SETTINGS

Baseline. We selected three types of methods for comparison: topology-based methods, feature-based methods, and GNN methods. For each type, some representatives were chosen. The topology-based representatives are struc2vec (Ribeiro et al., 2017), GraphWave (Donnat et al., 2018) and Label Propagation (Zhu & Ghahramani, 2002), which only utilize graph structure. struc2vec learns latent representations for the structural identity of nodes by random walk (Perozzi et al., 2014), where node degree is used as topology features. GraphWave is a graph signal processing method (Ortega et al., 2018) that leverages heat wavelet diffusion patterns to represent each node and is capable of capturing complex topology features (e.g., loops and cliques). Label Propagation propagates labels from labeled nodes to unlabeled nodes. The feature-based methods are Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which only use node features. The GNN representatives are GCN, GraphSAGE and GAT, which utilize both graph structure and node features.

Datasets. We used five real-world datasets: three citation networks (i.e., CiteSeer, Cora (Sen et al., 2008) PubMed (Namata et al., 2012)), one computer co-purchasing network in Amazon (McAuley et al., 2015), and one Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Network (Luckie et al., 2013). The BGP network describes the Internet's inter-domain structure and only about  $16\%$  of the nodes have labels. Thus, we created two datasets: BGP (full), which is the original graph, and BGP (small), which was obtained by removing all unlabeled nodes and edges connected to them. The details (e.g., statistics and descriptions) of the datasets are given in Appendix D.

Settings. We use F1-Micro score to measure the performance of each method for node classification. To avoid under-fitting,  $70\%$  nodes in each graph are used for training,  $10\%$  for validation and  $20\%$  for testing. For each baseline method, we set their the parameters either as their default values or the same as in CS-GNN. For the GNNs and MLP, the number of hidden layers (rounds) was set as  $K = 2$  to avoid over-smoothing. More detailed settings are given in Appendix E.

Note that GraphSAGE allows users to choose an aggregator. We tested four aggregators for GraphSAGE (details in Appendix F) and report the best result for each dataset in our experiments below.

# 4.2 PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF NODE CLASSIFICATION

Table 2 presents three sets of results for the task of node classification: the smoothness values of datasets, the F1-Micro scores, and the improvements of GNNs over non-GNN methods.

Smoothness. Amazon has a much larger  $\lambda_{f}$  value (i.e.,  $89.67 \times 10^{-2}$ ) than the rest, while PubMed has the smallest value, which imply that the feature vectors of most nodes in Amazon are dissimilar and conversely for PubMed. For label smoothness  $\lambda_{l}$ , BGP (small) has a fairly larger value (i.e., 0.71) than the others, which means that  $71\%$  of connected nodes have different labels. Since BGP (full) contains many unlabeled nodes, we used BGP (small)'s  $\lambda_{l}$  as an estimation.

F1-Micro scores. The F1-Micro scores are further divided into three groups. For the topology-based methods, Label Propagation has relatively good performance for the citation networks and the co-purchasing Amazon network. This is because Label Propagation is effective in community detection and these graphs contain many community structures, which can also be inferred from their small  $\lambda_{l}$  values (i.e., many nodes have the same class label as their neighbors, while nodes that are connected together and in the same class tend to form a community). In contrast, for the BGP graph in which the role (class) of the nodes is mainly decided by topology features, struc2vec and GraphWave give better performance. GraphWave ran out of memory (512 GB) on the larger graphs as it is a spectrum-based method. For the feature-based methods, Logistic Regression and MLP have comparable performance on all the graphs.

For the GNN methods, GCN and GraphSAGE have comparable performance except on the PubMed and BGP graphs, and similar results are observed for GAT and CS-GNN. The main reason is that PubMed has a small  $\lambda_{f}$ , which means that a small amount of information gain is obtained from the surrounding, and BGP has large  $\lambda_{l}$ , meaning that most information obtained from the surrounding is negative disturbance. Under these two circumstances, using concatenation as the combination function allows GraphSAGE and CS-GNN to retain a node's own features. This is also why Logistic Regression and MLP also achieve good performance on PubMed and BGP because they only use the node features. However, for the other datasets, GAT and CS-GNN have considerably higher F1-Micro scores than all the other methods. Overall, CS-GNN is the only method that achieves competitive performance on all the datasets.

Improvements over non-GNN methods. We also evaluate whether GNNs are always better methods, in other words, whether graph information is always useful. The last set of results in Table 2 list the improvements (in %) of existing GNNs (i.e., GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT) and CS-GNN over the topology-based and feature-based methods, respectively, where the improvements are calculated based on the average F1-Micro scores of each group of methods. The results show that using the topology alone, even if the surrounding neighborhood is considered, is not sufficient. This is true even for the BGP graphs for which the classes of nodes are mainly determined by the graph topology.

Compared with feature-based methods, GNN methods gain more information from the surrounding, which is converted into performance improvements. However, for graphs with small  $\lambda_{f}$  and large  $\lambda_{l}$ , existing GNN methods fail to obtain sufficient useful information or obtain too much negative noisy information, thus leading to even worse performance than purely feature-based methods. In contrast, CS-GNN utilizes smoothness to increase the gain of positive information and reduce negative noisy information for a given task, thus achieving good performance on all datasets.

# 4.3 SMOOTHNESS ANALYSIS

Although the results in Section 4.2 are consistent with that GNNs can achieve good performance by gaining surrounding information in graphs with large  $\lambda_{f}$  and small  $\lambda_{l}$ , the experiments were conducted on different graphs and there could be other factors than just the smoothness values of the graphs. Thus, in this experiment we aim to verify the effects of smoothness using one graph only.

Figure 1: The effects of smoothness

To adjust  $\lambda_{f}$  in a graph, we broadcast the feature vector of each node to its neighbors in rounds. In each round, when a node receives feature vectors, it updates its feature vector as the mean of its current feature vector and those feature vectors received, and then broadcast the new feature vector to its neighbors. If we keep broadcasting iteratively, all node features converge to the same value due to over-smoothness. To adjust  $\lambda_{l}$ , we randomly drop a fraction of edges that connect two nodes with different labels. The removal of such edges decreases the value of  $\lambda_{l}$  and allows nodes to gain more positive information from their neighbors. We used the Amazon graph for the evaluation because the graph is dense and has large  $\lambda_{f}$ .

Figure 1 reports the F1-Micro scores of the neural-network-based methods (i.e., MLP and the GNNs). Figure 1 (left) shows that as we broadcast from  $2^{0}$  to  $2^{8}$  rounds,  $\lambda_{f}$  also decreases accordingly. As  $\lambda_{f}$  decreases, the performance of the GNN methods also worsens due to over-smoothness. However, the performance of MLP first improves significantly and then worsens, and becomes the poorest at the end. This is because the GNN methods can utilize the surrounding information by their design but MLP cannot. Thus, the broadcast of features makes it possible for MLP to first attain the surrounding information. But after many rounds of broadcast, the effect of over-smoothness becomes obvious and MLP's performance becomes poor. The results are also consistent with the fact that GNN models cannot be deep due to the over-smoothness effect. Figure 1 (right) shows that when  $\lambda_{l}$  decreases, the performance of the GNN methods improves accordingly. On the contrary, since MLP does not use surrounding information, dropping edges has no effect on its performance. In summary, Figure 1 further verifies that GNNs can achieve good performance on graphs with large  $\lambda_{f}$  and small  $\lambda_{l}$ , where they can obtain more positive information gain from the surrounding.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

We studied how to measure the quantity and quality of the information that GNNs can obtain from graph data. We then proposed CS-GNN to apply the smoothness measures to improve the use of graph information. We validated the usefulness of our method for measuring the smoothness values of a graph for a given task and that CS-GNN is able to gain more useful information to achieve improved performance over existing methods.
