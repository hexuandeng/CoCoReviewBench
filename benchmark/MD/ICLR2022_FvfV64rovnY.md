# ABSTRACT

The test loss of well-trained neural networks often follows precise power-law scaling relations with either the size of the training dataset or the number of parameters in the network. We propose a theory that explains and connects these scaling laws. We identify variance-limited and resolution-limited scaling behavior for both dataset and model size, for a total of four scaling regimes. The variance-limited scaling follows simply from the existence of a well-behaved infinite data or infinite width limit, while the resolution-limited regime can be explained by positing that models are effectively resolving a smooth data manifold. In the large width limit, this can be equivalently obtained from the spectrum of certain kernels, and we present evidence that large width and large dataset resolution-limited scaling exponents are related by a duality. We exhibit all four scaling regimes in the controlled setting of large random feature and pretrained models and test the predictions empirically on a range of standard architectures and datasets. We also observe several empirical relationships between datasets and scaling exponents: super-classing image tasks does not change exponents, while changing input distribution (via changing datasets or adding noise) has a strong effect. We further explore the effect of architecture aspect ratio on scaling exponents.

# 1 SCALING LAWS FOR NEURAL NETWORKS

For a large variety of models and datasets, neural network performance has been empirically observed to scale as a power-law with model size and dataset size (Hestness et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020; Rosenfeld et al., 2020b; Henighan et al., 2020). These exponents determine how quickly performance improves with more data and larger models. We would like to understand why these power-laws emerge, and what features of the data and models determine the values of the power law exponents.

In this work, we present a theoretical framework for understanding scaling laws in trained neural networks. We identify four related scaling regimes with respect to the number of model parameters  $P$  and the dataset size  $D$ . With respect to each of  $D, P$ , there is both a variance-limited regime and a resolution-limited regime.

Variance-Limited Regime In the limit of infinite data or an arbitrarily wide model, some aspects of neural network training simplify. Specifically, if we fix one of  $D$ ,  $P$  and study scaling with respect to the other parameter as it becomes arbitrarily large, then the difference between the finite test loss and its limiting value scales as  $1 / x$ , i.e. as a power-law with exponent 1, with  $x = D$  or  $\sqrt{P} \propto$  width in deep networks and  $x = D$  or  $P$  in linear models.

Resolution-Limited Regime In this regime, one of  $D$  or  $P$  is effectively infinite, and we study scaling as the other parameter increases. In this case, a variety of works have empirically observed power-law scalings  $1 / x^{\alpha}$ , typically with  $0 < \alpha < 1$  for both  $x = P$  or  $D$ . We derive exponents in this regime precisely in the setting of random feature models (c.f. next section). Empirically, we find that our theoretical predictions for exponents hold in pretrained, fine-tuned models even though these lie outside our theoretical setting.

Figure 1: (a) Four scaling regimes Here we exhibit the four regimes we focus on in this work. (top-left, bottom-right) Variance-limited scaling of under-parameterized models with dataset size and over-parameterized models with number of parameters (width) exhibit universal scaling  $(\alpha_{D} = \alpha_{W} = 1)$  independent of the architecture or underlying dataset. (top-right, bottom-left) Resolution-limited over-parameterized models with dataset or under-parameterized models with model size exhibit scaling with exponents that depend on the details of the data distribution. These four regimes are also found in random feature (Figure 2a) and pretrained models (see supplement). (b) Resolution-limited models interpolate the data manifold Linear interpolation between two training points in a four-dimensional input space (top). We show a teacher model and four student models, each trained on different sized datasets. In all cases teacher and student approximately agree on the training endpoints, but as the training set size increases they increasingly match everywhere. (bottom) We show  $4 / \alpha_{D}$  versus the data manifold dimension (input dimension for teacher-student models, intrinsic dimension for standard datasets). We find that the teacher-student models follow the  $4 / \alpha_{D}$  (dark dashed line), while the relationship for a four layer CNN (solid) and WRN (hollow) on standard datasets is less clear.

(b)

For more general nonlinear models, we propose a refinement of naive bounds into estimates via expansions that hold asymptotically. These rely on the idea that additional data (in the infinite model-size limit) or added model parameters (in the infinite data limit) are used by the model to carve up the data manifold into smaller components. For smooth manifolds, loss, and network, the test loss will depend on the linear size of a sub-region, while it is the  $d$ -dimensional sub-region volume that scales inversely with  $P$  or  $D$ , giving rise to  $\alpha \propto 1 / d$ . To test this empirically, we make measurements of the resolution-limited exponents in neural networks and intrinsic dimension of the data manifold, shown in Figure 1b.

Explicit Derivation We derive the scaling laws for these four regimes explicitly in the setting of random feature teacher-student models, which also applies to neural networks in the large width limit. This setting allows us to solve for the test error directly in terms of the feature covariance (kernel). The scaling of the test loss then follows from the asymptotic decay of the spectrum of the covariance matrix. For generic continuous kernels on a  $d$ -dimensional manifold, we can further relate this to the dimension of the data manifold.

# Summary of Contributions:

1. We propose four scaling regimes for neural networks. The variance-limited and resolution-limited regimes originate from different mechanisms, which we identify. To our knowledge,

this categorization has not been previously exhibited. We provide empirical support for all four regimes in deep networks on standard datasets.

2. We derive the variance-limited regime under simple yet general assumptions (Theorem 1).  
3. We present a hypothesis for resolution-limited scaling through refinement of naive bounds (Theorems 2, 3), for general nonlinear models. We empirically test the dependence of the estimates on intrinsic dimension of the data manifold for deep networks on standard datasets (Figure 1b).  
4. In the setting of random feature teacher-student networks, we derive both variance-limited and resolution-limited scaling exponents exactly. In the latter case, we relate this to the spectral decay of kernels. We identify a novel duality that exists between model and dataset size scaling.  
5. We empirically investigate predictions from the random features setting in pretrained, fine-tuned models on standard datasets and find they give excellent agreement.  
6. We study the dependence of the scaling exponent on changes in architecture and data, finding that (i) changing the input distribution via switching datasets and (ii) the addition of noise have strong effects on the exponent, while (iii) changing the target task via superclassing does not.

Related Works: There have been a number of recent works demonstrating empirical scaling laws (Hestness et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020; Rosenfeld et al., 2020b; Henighan et al., 2020; Rosenfeld et al., 2020a) in deep neural networks, including scaling laws with model size, dataset size, compute, and other observables such as mutual information and pruning. Some precursors (Ahmad & Tesauro, 1989; Cohn & Tesauro, 1991) can be found in earlier literature. Recently, scaling laws have also played a significant role in motivating work on the largest models that have yet been developed (Brown et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021).

There has been comparatively little work on theoretical ideas (Sharma & Kaplan, 2020; Bisla et al., 2021) that match and explain empirical findings in generic deep neural networks. In the particular case of large width, deep neural networks behave as random feature models (Neal, 1994; Lee et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2018; Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Dyer & Gur-Ari, 2020), and known results on the loss scaling of kernel methods can be applied (Spigler et al., 2020; Bordelon et al., 2020). Though not in the original, Bordelon et al. (2020) analyze resolution-limited dataset size scaling for power-law spectra in later versions.

During the completion of this work, Hutter (2021) presented a specific solvable model of learning exhibiting non-trivial power-law scaling for power-law (Zipf) distributed features. This does not directly relate to the setups studied in this work, or present bounds that supersede our results. Concurrent to our work, Bisla et al. (2021) presented a derivation of the resolution-limited scaling with dataset size, also stemming from nearest neighbor distance scaling on data manifolds. However, they do not discuss requirements on model versus dataset size or how this scaling behavior fits into other asymptotic scaling regimes.

In the variance-limited regime, scaling laws in the context of random feature models (Rahimi & Recht, 2008; Hastie et al., 2019; d'Ascoli et al., 2020), deep linear models (Advani & Saxe, 2017; Advani et al., 2020), one-hidden-layer networks (Mei & Montanari, 2019; Adlam & Pennington, 2020a;b), and wide neural networks treated as Gaussian processes or trained in the NTK regime (Lee et al., 2019; Dyer & Gur-Ari, 2020; Andreassen & Dyer, 2020; Geiger et al., 2020) have been studied. In particular, this behavior was used in (Kaplan et al., 2020) to motivate a particular ansatz for simultaneous scaling with data and model size. The resolution-limited analysis can perhaps be viewed as an attempt to quantify the ideal-world generalization error of Nakkiran et al. (2021).

This work makes use of classic results connecting the spectrum of a smooth kernel to the geometry it is defined over (Weyl, 1912; Reade, 1983; Kuhn, 1987; Ferreira & Menegatto, 2009) and on the scaling of iteratively refined approximations to smooth manifolds (Stein, 1999; Bickel et al., 2007; de Laat, 2011).

# 2 FOUR SCALING REGIMES

Throughout this work we will be interested in how the average test loss  $L(D, P)$  depends on the dataset size  $D$  and the number of model parameters  $P$ . Unless otherwise noted,  $L$  denotes the test loss averaged over initialization of the parameters and draws of a size  $D$  training set. Some of our results only pertain directly to the scaling with width  $w \propto \sqrt{P}$ , but we expect many of the intuitions apply more generally. We use the notation  $\alpha_{D}, \alpha_{P},$  and  $\alpha_{W}$  to indicate scaling exponents with respect to dataset size, parameter count, and width. All proofs appear in the supplement.

# 2.1 VARIANCE-LIMITED EXPONENTS

In the limit of large  $D$  the outputs of an appropriately trained network approach a limiting form with corrections which scale as  $D^{-1}$ . Similarly, recent work shows that wide networks have a smooth large  $P$  limit (Jacot et al., 2018), where fluctuations scale as  $1 / \sqrt{P}$ . If the loss is sufficiently smooth then its value will approach the asymptotic loss with corrections proportional to the variance,  $(1 / D$  or  $1 / \sqrt{P})$ . In Theorem 1 we present sufficient conditions on the loss to ensure this variance dominated scaling. We note, these conditions are satisfied by mean squared error and cross entropy loss, though we conjecture the result holds even more generally.

Theorem 1. Let  $\ell(f)$  be the test loss as a function of network output,  $(L = \mathbb{E}[\ell(f)])$ , and let  $f_T$  be the network output after  $T$  training steps, thought of as a random variable over weight initialization, draws of the training dataset, and optimization seed. Further let  $f_T$  be concentrating with  $\mathbb{E}[(f_T - \mathbb{E}[f_T])^k] = \mathcal{O}(\epsilon) \forall k \geq 2$ . If  $\ell$  is a finite degree polynomial, or has bounded second derivative, or is 2-Hölder, then  $\mathbb{E}[\ell(f_T)] - \ell(\mathbb{E}[f_T]) = \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ .

Dataset scaling Consider a neural network, and its associated training loss  $L_{\mathrm{train}}(\theta)$ . For every value of the weights, the training loss, thought of as a random variable over draws of a training set of size  $D$ , concentrates around the population loss, with a variance which scales as  $\mathcal{O}\left(D^{-1}\right)$ . If the optimization procedure is sufficiently smooth, the trained weights, network output, and higher moments, will approach their infinite  $D$  values,  $\mathbb{E}_D\left[(f_T - \mathbb{E}_D[f_T])^k\right] = \mathcal{O}(D^{-1})$ . Here, the subscript  $D$  on the expectation indicates an average over draws of the training set. This scaling together with Theorem 1 gives the variance limited scaling of loss with dataset size.

This concentration result with respect to dataset size has appeared for linear models in Rahimi & Recht (2008) and for single hidden layer networks with high-dimensional input data in Mei & Montanari (2019); Adlam & Pennington (2020a;b). In the supplement we prove this for GD and SGD with polynomial loss as well as present informal arguments more generally. Additionally, we present examples violating the smoothness assumption and exhibiting different scaling.

Large Width Scaling We can make a very similar argument in the  $w \to \infty$  limit. It has been shown that the predictions from an infinitely wide network, either under Bayesian inference (Neal, 1994; Lee et al., 2018), or when trained via gradient descent (Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019) approach a limiting distribution at large width equivalent to a linear model. Furthermore, corrections to the infinite width behavior are controlled by the variance of the full model around the linear model predictions. This variance (and higher moments) have been shown to scale as  $1 / w$  (Dyer & Gur-Ari, 2020; Yaida, 2020; Andreassen & Dyer, 2020),  $\mathbb{E}_w\left[(f_T - \mathbb{E}_w[f_T])^k\right] = \mathcal{O}\left(w^{-1}\right)$ . Theorem 1 then implies the loss will differ from its  $w = \infty$  limit by a term proportional to  $1 / w$ .

We note that there has also been work studying the combined large depth and large width limit, where Hanin & Nica (2020) found a well-defined infinite size limit with controlled fluctuations. In any such context where the model predictions concentrate, we expect the loss to scale with the variance of the model output. In the case of linear models, studied below, the variance is  $\mathcal{O}(P^{-1})$  rather than  $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{P})$ , and we see the associated variance scaling in this case.

# 2.2 RESOLUTION-LIMITED EXPONENTS

In this section we consider training and test data drawn uniformly from a compact  $d$ -dimensional manifold,  $x \in \mathcal{M}_d$ , and targets given by some smooth function  $y = \mathcal{F}(x)$  on this manifold.

# Over-Parameterized Dataset Scaling

Consider the double limit of an over-parameterized model with large training set size,  $P \gg D \gg 1$ . We further consider well-trained models, i.e. models that interpolate all training data. The goal is to understand  $L(D)$ . If we assume that the learned model  $f$  is sufficiently smooth, then the dependence of the loss on  $D$  can be bounded in terms of the dimension of the data manifold  $\mathcal{M}_d$ .

Informally, if our train and test data are drawn i.i.d. from the same manifold, then the distance from a test point to the closest training data point decreases as we add more and more training data points. In particular, this distance scales as  $\mathcal{O}(D^{-1 / d})$  (Levina & Bickel, 2005). Furthermore, if  $f$ ,  $\mathcal{F}$  are both sufficiently smooth, they cannot differ too much over this distance. If in addition the loss function,  $L$ , is a smooth function vanishing when  $f = \mathcal{F}$ , we have  $L = \mathcal{O}(D^{-1 / d})$ . This is summarized in the following theorem.

Theorem 2. Let  $L(f)$ ,  $f$  and  $\mathcal{F}$  be Lipschitz with constants  $K_{L}, K_{f}$ , and  $K_{\mathcal{F}}$ . Further let  $\mathcal{D}$  be a training dataset of size  $D$  sampled i.i.d from  $\mathcal{M}_d$  and let  $f(x) = \mathcal{F}(x)$ ,  $\forall x \in \mathcal{D}$  then  $L(D) = \mathcal{O}\left(K_{L}\max (K_{f},K_{\mathcal{F}})D^{-1 / d}\right)$ .

# Under-Parameterized Parameter Scaling

We will again assume that  $\mathcal{F}$  varies smoothly on an underlying compact  $d$ -dimensional manifold  $\mathcal{M}_d$ . We can obtain a bound on  $L(P)$  if we imagine that  $f$  approximates  $\mathcal{F}$  as a piecewise function with roughly  $P$  regions (see Sharma & Kaplan (2020)). Here, we instead make use of the argument from the over-parameterized, resolution-limited regime above. If we construct a sufficiently smooth estimator for  $\mathcal{F}$  by interpolating among  $P$  randomly chosen points from the (arbitrarily large) training set, then by the argument above the loss will be bounded by  $\mathcal{O}(P^{-1/d})$ .

Theorem 3. Let  $L(f)$ ,  $f$  and  $\mathcal{F}$  be Lipschitz with constants  $K_{L}, K_{f}$ , and  $K_{\mathcal{F}}$ . Further let  $f(x) = \mathcal{F}(x)$  for  $P$  points sampled i.i.d from  $\mathcal{M}_d$  then  $L(P) = \mathcal{O}\left(K_L\max (K_f,K_\mathcal{F})P^{-1 / d}\right)$ .

# From Bounds to Estimates

Theorems 2 and 3 are phrased as bounds, but we expect the stronger statement that these bounds also generically serve as estimates, so that  $\operatorname{eg} L(D) = \Omega(D^{-c/d})$  for  $c \geq 2$ , and similarly for parameter scaling. If we assume that  $\mathcal{F}$  and  $f$  are analytic functions on  $\mathcal{M}_d$  and that the loss function  $L(f, \mathcal{F})$  is analytic in  $f - \mathcal{F}$  and minimized at  $f = \mathcal{F}$ , then the loss at a given test input,  $x_{\mathrm{test}}$ , can be expanded around the nearest training point,  $\hat{x}_{\mathrm{train}}$ ,  $L(x_{\mathrm{test}}) = \sum_{m=n \geq 2}^{\infty} a_m (\hat{x}_{\mathrm{train}})(x_{\mathrm{test}} - \hat{x}_{\mathrm{train}})^m$ ,<sup>2</sup> where the first term is of finite order  $n \geq 2$  because the loss vanishes at the training point. As the typical distance between nearest neighbor points scales as  $D^{-1/d}$  on a  $d$ -dimensional manifold, the loss will be dominated by the leading term,  $L \propto D^{-n/d}$ , at large  $D$ . Note that if the model provides an accurate piecewise linear approximation, we will generically find  $n \geq 4$ .

# 2.3 EXPLICIT REALIZATION IN LINEAR MODELS

In the preceding sections we have conjectured typical case scaling relations for a model's test loss. We have further given intuitive arguments for this behavior which relied on smoothness assumptions on the loss and training procedure. In this section, we provide a concrete realization of all four scaling regimes within the context of linear models. Of particular interest is the resolution-limited regime, where the scaling of the loss is a consequence of the linear model kernel spectrum – the scaling of over-parameterized models with dataset size and under-parameterized models with parameters is a consequence of a classic result, originally due to Weyl (1912), bounding the spectrum of sufficiently smooth kernel functions by the dimension of the manifold they act on.

Linear predictors serve as a model system for learning. Such models are used frequently in practice when more expressive models are unnecessary or infeasible (McCullagh & Nelder, 1989; Rifkin & Lippert, 2007; Hastie et al., 2009) and also serve as an instructive test bed to study training dynamics (Advani et al., 2020; Goh, 2017; Hastie et al., 2019; Nakkiran, 2019; Grosse, 2021). Furthermore, in the large width limit, randomly initialized neural networks become Gaussian Processes (Neal, 1994; Lee et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2018; Novak et al., 2019; Garriga-Alonso et al., 2019; Yang, 2019), and in the low-learning rate regime (Lee et al., 2019; Lewkowycz et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) neural networks train as linear models at infinite width (Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Chizat et al., 2019).

Here we discuss linear models in general terms, though the results immediately hold for the special cases of wide neural networks. In this section we focus on teacher-student models with weights initialized to zero and trained with mean squared error (MSE) loss to their global optimum.

We consider a linear teacher,  $F$ , and student  $f$ ,  $F(x) = \sum_{M=1}^{S} \omega_{M} F_{M}(x)$ ,  $f(x) = \sum_{\mu=1}^{P} \theta_{\mu} f_{\mu}(x)$ . Here  $\{F_{M}\}$  are a (potentially infinite) pool of features and the teacher weights,  $\omega_{M}$  are taken to be normal distributed,  $\omega \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1/S)$ . The student model is built out of a subset of the teacher features. To vary the number of parameters in this simple model, we construct  $P$  features,  $f_{\mu=1,\dots,P}$ , by introducing a projector  $\mathcal{P}$  onto a  $P$ -dimensional subspace of the teacher features,  $f_{\mu} = \sum_{M} \mathcal{P}_{\mu M} F_{M}$ .

We train by sampling a training set of size  $D$  and minimizing the MSE loss,  $L_{\mathrm{train}} = \frac{1}{2D}\sum_{a=1}^{D}(f(x_a) - F(x_a))^2$ . We are interested in the test loss averaged over draws of our teacher and training dataset. The infinite data test loss,  $L(P) := \lim_{D\to \infty}L(D,P)$ , takes the form.

$$
L (P) = \frac {1}{2 S} \operatorname {T r} \left[ \mathcal {C} - \mathcal {C P} ^ {T} \left(\mathcal {P C P} ^ {T}\right) ^ {- 1} \mathcal {P C} \right]. \tag {1}
$$

Here we have introduced the feature-feature second moment-matrix,  $\mathcal{C} = \mathbb{E}_x\left[F(x)F^T (x)\right]$ .

If the teacher and student features had the same span, this would vanish, but due to the mismatch the loss is non-zero. On the other hand, if we keep a finite number of training points, but allow the

student to use all of the teacher features, the test loss,  $L(D) \coloneqq \lim_{P \to S} L(D, P)$ , takes the form,

$$
L (D) = \frac {1}{2} \mathbb {E} _ {x} \left[ \mathcal {K} (x, x) - \vec {\mathcal {K}} (x) \bar {\mathcal {K}} ^ {- 1} \vec {\mathcal {K}} (x) \right]. \tag {2}
$$

Here,  $\mathcal{K}(x,x^{\prime})$  is the data-data second moment matrix,  $\vec{\kappa}$  indicates restricting one argument to the  $D$  training points, while  $\bar{\kappa}$  indicates restricting both. This test loss vanishes as the number of training points becomes infinite but is non-zero for finite training size.

We present a full derivation of these expressions in the supplement. In the remainder of this section, we explore the scaling of the test loss with dataset and model size.

# 2.3.1 VARIANCE-LIMITED EXPONENTS

To derive the limiting expressions (1) and (2) for the loss one makes use of the fact that the sample expectation of the second moment matrix over the finite dataset, and finite feature set is close to the full covariance,  $\frac{1}{D}\sum_{a = 1}^{D}F(x_a)F^T (x_a) = \mathcal{C} + \delta \mathcal{C},\frac{1}{P} f^T (x)f(x') = \mathcal{K} + \delta \mathcal{K},$  with the fluctuations satisfying  $\mathbb{E}_D[\delta C^2 ] = \mathcal{O}(D^{-1})$  and  $\mathbb{E}_P[\delta K^2 ] = \mathcal{O}(P^{-1})$  , where expectations are taken over draws of a dataset of size  $D$  and over feature sets. Using these expansions yields the variance-limited scaling,  $L(D,P) - L(P) = \mathcal{O}(D^{-1}),L(D,P) - L(D) = \mathcal{O}(P^{-1})$  in the under-parameterized and over-parameterized settings respectively.

In Figure 2a we see evidence of these scaling relations for features built from randomly initialized ReLU networks on pooled MNIST independent of the pool size. In the supplement we provide an in-depth derivation of this behavior and expressions for the leading contributions to  $L(D, P) - L(P)$  and  $L(D, P) - L(D)$ .

# 2.3.2 RESOLUTION-LIMITED EXPONENTS

We now would like to analyze the scaling behavior of our linear model in the resolution-limited regimes, that is the scaling with  $P$  when  $1 \ll P \ll D$  and the scaling with  $D$  when  $1 \ll D \ll P$ . In these cases, the scaling is controlled by the shared spectrum of  $\mathcal{C}$  or  $\mathcal{K}$ . This spectrum is often well described by a power-law, where eigenvalues  $\lambda_{i}$  satisfy  $\lambda_{i} = \frac{1}{i^{1 + \alpha_{K}}}$ . See Figure 2b for example spectra on pooled MNIST. In this case, we will argue that the losses also obey a power law scaling, with the exponents controlled by the spectral decay factor,  $1 + \alpha_{K}$ .

$$
L (D) \propto D ^ {- \alpha_ {K}}, L (P) \propto P ^ {- \alpha_ {K}}. \tag {3}
$$

In other words, in this setting,  $\alpha_{P} = \alpha_{D} = \alpha_{K}$ . This is supported empirically in Figure 2b. We then argue that when the kernel function,  $\mathcal{K}$  is sufficiently smooth on a manifold of dimension  $d$ ,  $\alpha_{K} \propto d^{-1}$ , thus realizing the more general resolution-limited picture described above.

From spectra to scaling laws for the loss To be concrete let us focus on the over-parameterized loss. If we introduce the notation  $e_i$  for the eigenvectors of  $\mathcal{C}$  and  $\bar{e}_i$  for the eigenvectors of  $\frac{1}{D}\sum_{a=1}^{D}F(x_a)F^T(x_a)$ , the loss becomes,

$$
L (D) = \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {S} \lambda_ {i} \left(1 - \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {D} \left(e _ {i} \cdot \bar {e} _ {j}\right) ^ {2}\right). \tag {4}
$$

Before discussing the general asymptotic behavior of (4), we can gain some intuition by considering the case of large  $\alpha_{K}$ . In this case,  $\bar{e}_j\approx e_j$  (see e.g. Loukas (2017)), we can simplify (4) to,

$$
L (D) \propto \sum_ {D + 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {1}{i ^ {1 + \alpha_ {K}}} = \alpha_ {K} D ^ {- \alpha_ {K}} + \mathcal {O} \left(D ^ {- \alpha_ {K} - 1}\right). \tag {5}
$$

More generally in the supplement, following Bordelon et al. (2020); Canatar et al. (2021), we use replica theory methods to derive,  $L(D) \propto D^{-\alpha_K}$  and  $L(P) \propto P^{-\alpha_K}$ , without requiring the large  $\alpha_K$  limit.

Figure 3: Effect of data distribution on scaling exponents For CIFAR-100 superclassed to  $N$  classes (left), we find that the number of target classes does not have a visible effect on the scaling exponent. (right) For CIFAR-10 with the addition of Gaussian noise to inputs, we find the strength of the noise has a strong effect on performance scaling with dataset size. All models are WRN-28-10.

Data Manifolds and Kernels In Section 2.2, we discussed a simple argument that resolution-limited exponents  $\alpha \propto 1 / d$ , where  $d$  is the dimension of the data manifold. Our goal now is to explain how this connects with the linearized models and kernels discussed above: how does the spectrum of eigenvalues of a kernel relate to the dimension of the data manifold?

The key point is that sufficiently smooth kernels must have an eigenvalue spectrum with a bounded tail. Specifically, a  $C^t$  kernel on a  $d$ -dimensional space must have eigenvalues  $\lambda_n \lesssim \frac{1}{n^{1 + t / d}}$  (Kuhn, 1987). In the generic case where the covariance matrices we have discussed can be interpreted as kernels on a manifold, and they have spectra saturating the bound, linearized models will inherit scaling exponents given by the dimension of the manifold.

As a simple example, consider a  $d$ -torus. In this case we can study the Fourier series decomposition, and examine the case of a kernel  $K(x - y)$ . This must take the form  $K = \sum_{n_I} [a_{n_I} \sin(n_I \cdot (x - y)) + b_{n_I} \cos(n_I \cdot (x - y))]$ , where  $n_I = (n_1, \dots, n_d)$  are integer indices, and  $a_{n_I}, b_{n_I}$  are the overall Fourier coefficients. To guarantee that  $K$  is a  $C^t$  function, we must have  $a_{n_I}, b_{n_I} \lesssim \frac{1}{n^{d + t}}$  where  $n^d = N$  indexes the number of  $a_{n_I}$  in decreasing order. But this means that in this simple case, the tail eigenvalues of the kernel must be bounded by  $\frac{1}{N^{1 + t / d}}$  as  $N \to \infty$ .

# 2.4 DUALITY

We argued above that for kernels with pure power law spectra, the asymptotic scaling of the underparameterized loss with respect to model size and the over-parameterized loss with respect to dataset size share a common exponent. In the linear setup at hand, the relation between the underparameterized parameter dependence and over-parameterized dataset dependence is even stronger. The under-parameterized and over-parameterized losses are directly related by exchanging the projection onto random features with the projection onto random training points. Note, sample-wise double descent observed in Nakkiran (2019) is a concrete realization of this duality for a simple data distribution. In the supplement, we present examples exhibiting the duality of the loss dependence on model and dataset size outside of the asymptotic regime.

# 3 EXPERIMENTS

# 3.1 DEEP TEACHER-STUDENT MODELS

Our theory can be tested very directly in the teacher-student framework, in which a teacher deep neural network generates synthetic data used to train a student network. Here, it is possible to generate unlimited training samples and, crucially, controllably tune the dimension of the data manifold. We

accomplish the latter by scanning over the dimension of the inputs to the teacher. We have found that when scanning over both model size and dataset size, the interpolation exponents closely match the prediction of  $4 / d$ . The dataset size scaling is shown in Figure 1, while model size scaling experiments appear in the supplement and have previously been observed in Sharma & Kaplan (2020).

# 3.2 VARIANCE-LIMITED SCALING IN THE WILD

Variance-limited scaling, (Section 2.1), can be universally observed in real datasets. Figure 1a (top-left, bottom-right) measures the variance-limited dataset scaling exponent  $\alpha_{D}$  and width scaling exponent  $\alpha_{W}$ . In both cases, we find striking agreement with the theoretically predicted values  $\alpha_{D}, \alpha_{W} = 1$  across a variety of datasets, network architecture, stochastic batch size and loss type. Our testbed includes deep fully-connected and convolutional networks with Relu or Erf nonlinearities and MSE or softmax-cross-entropy losses. The supplement contains experimental details.

# 3.3 RESOLUTION-LIMITED SCALING IN THE WILD

In addition to teacher-student models, we explored resolution-limited scaling behavior in the context of standard classification datasets. Wide ResNet (WRN) models (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) were trained for a fixed number of steps with cosine decay. In Figure 1b we also include data from a four hidden layer CNN detailed in the supplement. As detailed above, we find dataset dependent scaling behavior in this context.

We further investigated the effect of the data distribution on the resolution-limited exponent,  $\alpha_{D}$ , by tuning the number of target classes and input noise (Figure 3). To probe the effect of the number of classes, we constructed tasks derived from CIFAR-100 by grouping classes into broader semantic categories. We found that performance depends on the number of categories, but  $\alpha_{D}$  is insensitive to this number. In contrast, the addition of Gaussian noise had a more pronounced effect on  $\alpha_{D}$ . This suggests a picture in which the network learns to model the input data manifold, independent of the classification task, consistent with observations in Nakkiran & Bansal (2020); Grathwohl et al. (2020).

We also explored the effect of aspect ratio on dataset scaling, finding that the exponent magnitude increases with width up to a critical width, while the dependence on depth is milder (see supplement).

# 4 DISCUSSION

We have presented a framework for categorizing neural scaling laws, along with derivations that help to explain their very general origins. Crucially, our predictions agree with empirical findings in settings which have often proven challenging for theory - deep neural networks on real datasets. The variance-scaling regime yields, for smooth test losses, a universal prediction of  $\alpha_{D} = 1$  (for  $D\gg P$ ) and  $\alpha_{W} = 1$  (for  $w\gg D$ ). The resolution-limited regime yields exponents whose numerical value is variable and data and model dependent.

There are many intriguing directions for future work; amongst these, we highlight one in particular. The invariance of the dataset scaling exponent to superclassing (Figure 3) suggests that deep networks may be largely learning properties of the input data manifold - akin to unsupervised learning - rather than significant task-specific structure, which may shed light on the versatility of learned deep network representations for different downstream tasks. This begs to be explored further.

Limitations One limitation is that our theoretical results are asymptotic, while experiments are performed with finite models and datasets. This is apparent in the resolution-limited regime which requires a hierarchy ( $D \gg P$  or  $P \gg D$ ). In Figures 1a and 2a top-right (bottom-left), we see a breakdown of the predicted scaling behavior as  $D(P)$  become large and the hierarchy is lost. Furthermore in the resolution-limited regime for deep networks, our theoretical tools rely on positing the existence of a data manifold. A precise definition of the data manifold, however, is lacking forcing us to use imperfect proxies, such as nearest neighbor distances of final embedding layers.

Ethics Statement Work on scaling laws provides an opportunity for discussion on how to define and measure progress in machine learning. The values of exponents allow us to estimate expected gains that come from increases in scale of dataset, model, and compute. Applying similar considerations to other metrics (i.e. transfer, bias, robustness) in principle allows one to quantify whether and how models are improving or degrading with scale and at what environmental or computational cost. On the other hand, one may require that truly non-trivial progress in machine learning be progress that occurs modulo scale: namely, improvements in performance across different tasks that are not simple extrapolations of existing behavior. And perhaps the right combinations of algorithmic, model, and dataset improvements can lead to emergent behavior at new scales. Large language models such as GPT-3 (Fig. 1.2 in Brown et al. (2020)) have exhibited this in the context of few-shot learning. We hope our work spurs further research in understanding and controlling neural scaling laws.
