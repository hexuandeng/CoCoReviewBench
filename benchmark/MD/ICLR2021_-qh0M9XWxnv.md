# ABSTRACT

In the recent literature of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), the expressive power of models has been studied through their capability to distinguish if two given graphs are isomorphic or not. Since the graph isomorphism problem is NP-intermediate, and Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test can give sufficient but not enough evidence in polynomial time, the theoretical power of GNNs is usually evaluated by the equivalence of WL-test order, followed by an empirical analysis of the models on some reference inductive and transductive datasets. However, such analysis does not account the signal processing pipeline, whose capability is generally evaluated in the spectral domain. In this paper, we argue that a spectral analysis of GNNs behavior can provide a complementary point of view to go one step further in the understanding of GNNs. By bridging the gap between the spectral and spatial design of graph convolutions, we theoretically demonstrate some equivalence of the graph convolution process regardless it is designed in the spatial or the spectral domain. Using this connection, we managed to re-formulate most of the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into one common framework. This general framework allows to lead a spectral analysis of the most popular GNNs, explaining their performance and showing their limits according to spectral point of view. Our theoretical spectral analysis is confirmed by experiments on various graph databases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of high and/or band-pass filters on a graph dataset, while the majority of GNN is limited to only low-pass and inevitably it fails.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Over the last five years, many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed in the literature of geometric deep learning (Veličković et al., 2018; Gilmer et al., 2017; Bronstein et al., 2017; Battaglia et al., 2018), in order to generalize the very efficient deep learning paradigm into the world of graphs. This large number of contributions explains a new challenge recently tackled by the community, which consists in assessing the expressive power of GNNs.

In this area of research, there is a consensus to evaluate the theoretic expressive power of GNNs according to equivalence of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test order (Morris et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Maron et al., 2019b;a). Hence, GNNs models are frequently classified as "as powerful as 1-WL", "as powerful as 2-WL", ..., "as powerful as k-WL". However, this perspective cannot make differences between two methods if they are as powerful as the same WL test order. Moreover, it does not always explain success or failure of any GNN on common benchmark datasets.

In this paper, we claim that analyzing theoretically and experimentally GNNs with a spectral point of view can bring a new perspective on their expressive power.

So far, GNNs have been generally studied separately as spectral based or as spatial based (Wu et al., 2019b; Chami et al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) (Gilmer et al., 2017) and GraphNets (Battaglia et al., 2018) are the only attempts to merge both approaches in the same framework. However, these models are not able to generalize custom designed spectral filters, as well as the effect of each convolution support in a multi convolution case. The spatial-spectral connection is also mentioned indirectly in several cornerstone studies by Defferrard et al. (2016); Kipf & Welling (2017); Levie et al. (2019). Since the spectral-spatial interchangeability is missing, they did not propose to show spectral behavior of any graph convolution.

Recent studies have also attempted to show, for a limited number of spatial GNNs, that they act as low-pass filters (NT & Maehara, 2019; Wu et al., 2019a). NT & Maehara (2019) concluded that using adjacency induces low-pass effects, while Wu et al. (2019a) studied a single spatial GNN's spectral behavior by assuming adding self-connection changes the given topology of the graph.

In this paper, we bridge the gap between spectral and spatial domains for GNNs. Our first contribution consists in demonstrating the equivalence of convolution processes regardless if they are defined as spatial or as spectral GNN. Using this connection, we propose a new general framework and taxonomy for GNNs as the second contribution. Taking advantage of this equivalence, our third contribution is to provide a spectral analysis of any GNN model. This spectral analysis is another perspective for the analyse of expressive power of GNNs. Our theoretical spectral analysis is confirmed by experiments on various well-known graph datasets. Furthermore, we show the necessity of high and/or band-pass filters in our experiments, while the majority of GNNs are limited to only low-pass filters and thus inevitably fail when dealing with these problems.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces convolutional GNNs and presents existing approaches. In Section 3 and Section 4, we describe the main contributions mentioned above. Section 5 presents a series of experiments and results which validate our propositions. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper.

# 2 PROBLEM STATEMENT AND STATE OF THE ART

Let  $G$  be a graph with  $n$  nodes and an arbitrary number of edges. Connectivity is given by the adjacency matrix  $A \in \{0,1\}^{n \times n}$  and features are defined on nodes by  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times f_0}$ , with  $f_0$  the length of feature vectors. For any matrix  $X$ , we used  $X_i$ ,  $X_{:j}$  and  $X_{i,j}$  to refer its  $i$ -th column vector,  $j$ -th row vector and scalar value on  $(i,j)$  location, respectively. A graph Laplacian is  $L = D - A$  (or  $L = I - D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$ ) where  $D \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  is the diagonal degree matrix and  $I$  is the identity. Through eigendecomposition,  $L$  can be written by  $L = U\mathrm{diag}(\lambda)U^T$  where each column of  $U \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  is an eigenvector of  $L$ ,  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^n$  gathers the eigenvalues of  $L$  and  $\mathrm{diag}(.)$  function creates a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are from a given vector. We use superscript to refer same kind variable as base. For instance,  $H^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times f_l}$  refers node representation on layer  $l$  whose feature dimension is  $f_l$ . A Graph Convolution layer takes the node representation of the previous layer  $H^{(l-1)}$  as input and produces a new representation  $H^{(l)}$ , with  $H^{(0)} = X$ .

# 2.1 SPECTRAL APPROACHES

Spectral GNNs rely on the spectral graph theory (Chung, 1997). In this framework, signals on graphs are filtered using the eigendecomposition of graph Laplacian (Shuman et al., 2013). By transposing the convolution theorem to graphs, the spectral filtering in the frequency domain can be defined by  $x_{flt} = U\mathrm{diag}(\Phi (\pmb {\lambda}))U^{\top}x$ , where  $\Phi (.)$  is the desired filter function. As a consequence, a graph convolution layer in spectral domain can be written by a sum of filtered signals followed by an activation function as in (Bruna et al., 2013), namely

$$
H _ {j} ^ {(l + 1)} = \sigma \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {f _ {l}} U \operatorname {d i a g} \left(F _ {i} ^ {(l, j)}\right) U ^ {\top} H _ {i} ^ {(l)}\right), \quad \text {f o r} j \in \{1, \dots , f _ {l + 1} \}. \tag {1}
$$

Here,  $\sigma$  is the activation function,  $F^{(l,j)}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times f_l}$  is the corresponding weight vector to be tuned as used in (Henaff et al., 2015) for the single-graph problem known as non-parametric spectral GNN.

A first drawback is the necessity of Fourier and inverse Fourier transform by matrix multiplication of  $U$  and  $U^T$ . Another drawback occurs when generalizing the approach to multi-graph learning problems. Indeed, the  $k$ -th element of the vector  $F_{i}^{(l,j)}$  weights the contribution of the  $k$ -th eigenvector to the output. Those weights are not shareable between graphs of different sizes, which means a different length of  $F_{i}^{(l,j)}$  is needed. Moreover, even though the graphs have the same number of nodes, their eigenvalues will be different if their structures differ.

To overcome these issues, a few spatially-localized filters have been defined such as cubic B-spline (Bruna et al., 2013), polynomial and Chebyshev polynomial (Defferrard et al., 2016) and Cayley polynomial parameterization (Levie et al., 2019). With such approaches, trainable parameters are

defined by  $F_{i}^{(l,j)} = B\left[W_{i,j}^{(l,1)}, \ldots, W_{i,j}^{(l,s_{e})}\right]^{\top}$ , where each column in  $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times s_{e}}$  is designed as a function of eigenvalues, namely  $B_{i,j} = \Phi_{j}(\lambda_{i})$  and  $s_{e}$  is the desired number of filters. Here,  $W^{(l,s)} \in \mathbb{R}^{f_l \times f_{l+1}}$  is the trainable matrix for the  $l$ -th layer's  $s$ -th filter's.

# 2.2 SPATIAL APPROACHES

Spatial GNNs consider an agg operator, which aggregates the neighborhood nodes, and an upd operator, which updates the concerned node as follows:

$$
H _ {: v} ^ {(l + 1)} = \operatorname {u p d} \left(g _ {0} \left(H _ {: v} ^ {(l)}\right), \operatorname {a g g} \left(g _ {1} \left(H _ {: u} ^ {(l)}\right): u \in \mathcal {N} (v)\right)\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $\mathcal{N}(v)$  is the set of neighborhood nodes and  $g_0, g_1: \mathbb{R}^{n \times f_l} \to \mathbb{R}^{n \times f_{l+1}}$  trainable models. The choice of  $agg, upd, g_0, g_1$ , and even  $\mathcal{N}(v)$ , determines the capability of model.

The vanilla GNN (known by GIN-0 in (Xu et al., 2019)) uses the same weights in  $g_{0}$  and  $g_{1}$ .  $\mathcal{N}(v)$  is the set of connected nodes to  $v$ ,  $agg$  is the sum of all connected node values and  $upd(x, y) := \sigma(x + y)$  where  $\sigma$  is an elementwise nonlinearity. GCN has the same selection but normalizes features as in (Kipf & Welling, 2017). Kearnes et al. (2016) used separated weights in  $g_{0}$  and  $g_{1}$ , which means that two sets of trainable weights are applied on self feature and neighbor nodes. Other approaches defined multi neighborhood and used different  $g_{i}$  for different kind of neighborhood. For instance, Duvenaud et al. (2015) defined the neighborhood according to node label and/or degree, Niepert et al. (2016) reordered the neighbor nodes and used the same model  $g_{i}$  to neighbors according to their order.

These spatial GNNs use sum or normalized sum over  $g_{i}$  in equation 2. Other methods weighted this summation by another trainable parameter, where the weights can be written by the function of node and/or edge features in order to make the convolutions more productive, such as graph attention networks (Veličković et al., 2018; Hamilton et al., 2017), MoNet (Monti et al., 2017), GatedGCN (Bresson & Laurent, 2018) and SplineCNN (Fey et al., 2018).

# 3 BRIDGING SPATIAL AND SPECTRAL GNNS

When  $upd(x,y) = \sigma (x + y)$ ,  $agg$  is a sum (or weighted sum) of the defined neighborhood nodes contributions and  $g_{i}$  applies linear transformation, one can trivially show that mentioned spatial GNNs can be generalized as propagation of the node features to the neighboring nodes followed by feature transformation and activation function of the form

$$
H ^ {(l + 1)} = \sigma \left(\sum_ {s} C ^ {(s)} H ^ {(l)} W ^ {(l, s)}\right), \tag {3}
$$

where  $C^{(s)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  is the  $s$ -th convolution support that defines how the node features are propagated to the neighboring nodes. Within this generalization, GNNs differ from each other by the choice of convolution supports  $C^{(s)}$ . This formulation generalizes many different kinds of Graph Convolutions, as well as Euclidean domain convolutions, which can be seen in Appendix A with the detailed schema.

Definition 1. A Trainable-support is a Graph Convolution Support  $C^{(s)}$  with at least one trainable parameter that can be tuned during training. If  $C^{(s)}$  has no trainable parameters, i.e. when the supports are pre-designed, it is called a fixed-support graph convolution.

In the trainable support case, supports can be different in each layer, which can be shown by  $C^{(l,s)}$  for the  $s$ -th support in layer  $l$ . Formally, we can define a trainable support by:

$$
\left(C ^ {(l, s)}\right) _ {v, u} = h _ {s, l} \left(H _ {: v} ^ {(l)}, H _ {: u} ^ {(l)}, E _ {v, u} ^ {(l)}, A\right), \tag {4}
$$

where  $E_{v,u}^{(l)}$  shows edge features on layer  $l$  from node  $v$  to node  $u$  if it is available and  $h(.)$  is any trainable model parametrized by  $(s,l)$ .

Theorem 1. Spectral GNN parameterized with  $B$  of entries  $B_{i,j} = \Phi_j(\lambda_i)$ , defined as

$$
H _ {j} ^ {(l + 1)} = \sigma \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {f _ {l}} U \operatorname {d i a g} \left(B \left[ W _ {i, j} ^ {(l, 1)}, \dots , W _ {i, j} ^ {(l, s _ {e})} \right] ^ {\top}\right) U ^ {\top} H _ {i} ^ {(l)}\right), \tag {5}
$$

is a particular case of framework in equation 3 with the convolution kernel set to

$$
C ^ {(s)} = U \operatorname {d i a g} \left(\Phi_ {s} (\boldsymbol {\lambda})\right) U ^ {\top}. \tag {6}
$$

The proof can be found in Appendix B. This theorem is general and it covers many well-known spectral GNNs, such as non-parametric spectral graph convolution (Henaff et al., 2015), polynomial parameterization (Defferrard et al., 2016), cubic B-spline parameterization (Bruna et al., 2013), CayleyNet (Levie et al., 2019) and also any custom designed graph convolution. From Theorem 1, one can see that the spatial and spectral GNNs work all the same way. Therefore, Fourier calculations are not necessary when convolutions are parameterized by  $B$ . As a consequence of Theorem 1, one can see that the separation of spectral and spatial GNNs is just an interpretation. The only difference is the way convolution supports are designed: either in the spectral domain or in the spatial one.

Definition 2. A Spectral-designed graph convolution refers to a convolution where supports are written as a function of eigenvalues  $(\Phi_s(\lambda))$  and eigenvectors  $(U)$  of the corresponding graph Laplacian (equation 6). Thus, each convolution support  $C^{(s)}$  has the same frequency response  $\Phi_s(\lambda)$  over different graphs. Graph convolution out of this definition is called spatial-designed graph convolution.

Corollary 1.1. The frequency profile of any given graph convolution support  $C^{(s)}$  can be defined in spectral domain by

$$
\Phi_ {s} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}) = \operatorname {d i a g} ^ {- 1} \left(U ^ {\top} C ^ {(s)} U\right). \tag {7}
$$

where  $\mathrm{diag}^{-1}(.)$  returns the vector made of the diagonal elements from the given matrix.

The proof of this corollary is given in Appendix C. This corollary leads to the spectral analysis of any given graph convolution support. Since the spatial-designed convolutions do not fit into equation 6,  $U^{\top}C^{(s)}U$  is not a diagonal matrix. Therefore, we also compute the full frequency profile by  $\Phi_s = U^\top C^{(s)}U$ , which includes all eigenvector pairwise contributions.

# 4 THEORETICAL FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF GRAPH CONVOLUTIONS

This section aims at providing a theoretical understanding of the graph convolution process through an analysis in the spectral domain of existing GNNs. To the best of our knowledge, no one has led such an analysis concerning graph convolutions in the literature. This analysis is based on a reformulation of existing graph convolutions in our general framework (equation 3), and based on deriving analytical expressions of  $\Phi_s(\lambda)$  (equation 7 in Corollary 1.1) for each convolution support of concerned graph convolution process. All proofs are provided in Appendices.

The theoretical frequency response of ChebNet (Defferrard et al., 2016) convolutions is given by the following theorem.

Theorem 2. The theoretical frequency response of each support of ChebNet can be defined as

$$
\Phi_ {1} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}) = \mathbf {1}, \quad \Phi_ {2} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}) = \frac {2 \boldsymbol {\lambda}}{\lambda_ {\max }} - \mathbf {1}, \quad \Phi_ {k} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}) = 2 \Phi_ {2} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}) \Phi_ {k - 1} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}) - \Phi_ {k - 2} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}), \tag {8}
$$

where  $\mathbf{1}$  is the vector of ones and  $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$  is the maximum eigenvalue.

The proof of Theorem 2 is given in Appendix D. Since it has no trainable parameter in the supports and all support frequency responses do not depend on the graph, we can classify ChebNet as spectral-designed fixed-support graph convolution.

The theoretical frequency response of CayleyNet (Levie et al., 2019) convolution is given in the following theorem, and its proof is given in Appendix E.

Theorem 3. The theoretical frequency response of each support of CayleyNet can be defined as

$$
\Phi_ {s} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1 & \text {i f} s = 1 \\ \cos \left(\frac {s}{2} \theta (h \boldsymbol {\lambda})\right) & \text {i f} s \in \{2, 4, \dots , 2 r \} \\ - \sin \left(\frac {s - 1}{2} \theta (h \boldsymbol {\lambda})\right) & \text {i f} s \in \{3, 5, \dots , 2 r + 1 \} \end{array} \right. \tag {9}
$$

where  $h$  is a trainable scalar and  $\theta(x) = \text{atan2}(-1, x) - \text{atan2}(1, x)$ .

Since it has a trainable parameter  $h$  in the supports and all support frequency responses do not depend on the graph, we can classify CayleyNet as spectral-designed trainable-support graph convolution.

GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017) uses a single convolution support and its theoretical frequency response is defined approximately in the following theorem, and its proof is given in Appendix F.

Theorem 4. The theoretical frequency response of GCN support can be approximated as

$$
\Phi (\boldsymbol {\lambda}) \approx \mathbf {1} - \boldsymbol {\lambda} \bar {p} / (\bar {p} + 1), \tag {10}
$$

where  $\overline{p}$  is the average node degree in the graph.

Since its support has no trainable parameter but the frequency response is not independent of the graph, we can classify GCN as spatial-designed fixed-support graph convolution.

Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) defined in Xu et al. (2019) has attracted a lot of interests from the community, mostly because of its simple convolution mechanism. It has a single convolution support and its theoretical frequency response is given in the following theorem:

Theorem 5. The theoretical frequency response of GIN support can be approximated as

$$
\Phi (\boldsymbol {\lambda}) \approx \bar {p} \left(\frac {1 + \epsilon}{\bar {p}} + \mathbf {1} - \boldsymbol {\lambda}\right) \tag {11}
$$

where  $\epsilon$  is a trainable scalar.

The proof of this theorem is in Appendix G. Since its support has trainable parameters but the frequency response depends on the graph structure, we classify GIN as spatial-designed trainable-support graph convolution.

Graph attention networks (GATs) in (Veličković et al., 2018) proposes an application for graph world of the attention mechanism from Vaswani et al. (2017). Due to the fact that graphs are invariant to the node order, GAT cannot use positional encoding. In addition, instead of considering that all nodes are connected to each other, GAT just assigns attention weights to the node itself and the connected ones according to adjacency (sparse attention). Thus, we can see its convolution support as weighted, self loop added adjacency. GAT can be represented in our framework in equation 3 by defining trainable convolution supports as follows:

$$
\left(C ^ {(l, s)}\right) _ {v, u} = \frac {e _ {v , u}}{\sum_ {k \in \tilde {\mathcal {N}} (v)} e _ {v , k}}, \tag {12}
$$

where  $e_{v,u} = \exp \left(\sigma (\mathbf{a}^{(l,s)}[H_{:v}^{(l)}W^{(l,s)}||H_{:u}^{(l)}W^{(l,s)}])\right)$ , and  $\mathbf{a}^{(l,s)}$  is another trainable weight. Convolution support will be calculated from node  $v$  to each element of  $\tilde{\mathcal{N}} (v)$ , which shows the selfconnection added neighborhood. Thus, we classify GAT as spatial-designed trainable-support graph neural network in our framework. Since convolution supports are function of connected node features, a theoretical frequency response is not possible to formulate.

# 5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

This section is dedicated to empirical spectral analysis of existing GNNs on some certain graphs to validate the theoretical results and also performance analysis of these GNNs on a benchmark graph dataset to demonstrate the necessity of having various frequency responses convolution supports.

# 5.1 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS RESULTS

All empirical analyses are based on obtaining convolution supports matrix for certain GNN model, followed by equation 7 to obtain the frequency response. In our analysis, we used three graphs independently: the first is a 1D signal encoded as a regular circular line graph with 1001 nodes; the other are the well known Cora and CiteSeer graphs with 2708 and 3327 nodes respectively (Yang et al., 2016). Besides, we used 2 different collections of graph datasets, ENZYMES and PROTEIN, which have 600 and 1113 graph respectively (Kersting et al., 2016). The details of the graphs can be found in Appendix I.

(b) First 5 ChebNet supports

Since ChebNet and CayleyNet are spectral-designed, their frequency responses do not change for different graphs. They are presented in Figure 1 for first 5 and 7 supports respectively. The results in Figure 1 confirm the theoretical analyses in Theorem 2 and Theorem 3. The full frequency profiles are not illustrated because they consist of zeros outside the diagonal. Analyzing the frequency profile of ChebNet, one can argue that the convolutions mostly cover the spectrum. However, none of the kernels focuses on some certain parts of the spectrum. As an example, the second kernel is mostly a low-pass and high-pass filter and stops the middle band, while the third one passes very high, very low and middle bands, but stops almost first and third quarter of the spectrum. Therefore, if the relation between input-output pairs can be figured out by just a low-pass, high-pass or some specific band-pass filter, a high number of convolution kernels is needed. However, in the literature, only 2 or 3 kernels are generally used in experiments (Defferrard et al., 2016; Kipf & Welling, 2017).

The scale parameter  $h$  in CayleyNet affects the x-axis scaling, but does not change the global shape. When  $h = 1$ , frequency profiles can be defined within the range [0, 2] (because  $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}} = 2$  in all three test graphs). If  $h = 1.5$ , the frequency profile can be defined till  $1.5\lambda_{\mathrm{max}} = 3$  in Figure 1 and rescale axis label from [0, 3] to [0, 2] in original range. Learning the scaling of eigenvalues may seem advantageous. However, it induces extra computational cost in order to calculate the new convolution supports in every learning epoch. In addition, similarly to ChebNet, CayleyNet does not have any band specific convolutions, even when considering different scaling factors.

(c) GIN on CiteSeer

When the given graph is a regular graph where each node degree is the same (2 for 1D graph case), theoretical frequency responses become certain as seen in Figure 1a in blue for GCN and Figure 1b for GIN. When  $\epsilon = 2$ , 1D graph's  $(\overline{p} = 2)$  frequency responses of GCN and GIN are the same except scaling factor as seen in blue Figure 1a yellow in Figure 1b. However in realistic graphs,

both GIN and GCN are not spectral-designed, their frequency responses differ for different graphs. As Theorem 4 and Theorem 5 say, GCN's and GIN's frequency responses depend on the average node degree. GCN's cut-off frequency decrease by increasing the  $\overline{p}$  while  $\overline{p}$  acts as scaling factor on GIN's frequency response. This analysis leads us to understand that GCN works as low-pass filter and does not cover the whole spectrum. This approach is not able to learn relations that can be represented by high-pass or band-pass filtering. Hence, even though it gives very good results on a single graph node classification problem in Kipf & Welling (2017), it may fail for problems where discriminant information lies in particular frequency bands. Therefore, such an approach can be considered as problem specific.

In order to create some variations between low-pass to high-pass, having trainable parameter in GIN's convolution support seems advantageous. But, since it is not spectral-designed, there is no guaranty that it works exact the same way for extremely diverse graph datasets. Besides, its low-pass shape (where  $\epsilon$  is high) is a linearly decreasing function, so it is not strong low-pass where generally natural graph problems needs. Using more stacked layer may be a solution. In addition, this convolution cannot focus on some certain bands if the problem needs.

Figure 3: Frequency profiles of GAT  
(c) Heat density map of learned frequency response on PROTEINS

Since the GAT's convolution supports are function of connected nodes feature, frequency profiles cannot be directly computed similarly to previous ones. Thus, we proposed to obtain frequency response by two ways, one is the expected frequency responses among simulations, the other is the frequency responses of trained model for any specific graph learning problem.

We calculated the expected frequency responses of GAT convolution supports on Cora graph by simulation of randomly created 240 possible attention weights. The expected value of simulated support's frequency response and its standard deviation are shown in Figure 3a. This result gives an idea about the capability of the model on spectral domain, without being the true learned convolution support. In addition, the simulation is just for the first layer, because the first layer's input is known without learning. Besides, we also provide in Figure 3b-c the frequency responses of all learned GAT attention head's in all layers for all the graphs of ENZYMES and PROTEINS datasets respectively (in our model, there are two GNN layer consisting of 25 attention head). Since there is no significant differences between frequency responses in different layer or different attention head, we stacked all together in the same heat map.

As one can see, the mean standard frequency profile has a similar shape than those of GCN and GIN-0 which are methods that use self-looped added (normalized or not) adjacency matrix as convolution support. Variations on the frequency profile induce more variations on output signal when compared to GCN and GIN-0. However, the variation on frequency profile might not be sufficient in problems that need some specific band-pass filters.

# 5.2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF GNNS

Although most of the graph benchmark problems naturally require low-pass filtering, other problems might need various kinds of filters, like image understanding problems. In our experiments, we use the superpixel version of MNIST dataset (MNIST-75) to show an example of graph problems that need various filtering.

superpixel segmentation algorithm Achanta et al. (2012). Regions constitute the nodes of the graph and edges correspond to connection between regions in the image. The average pixel value of this region was assigned to node, giving one continuous value. The dataset also includes the center position of each region, but we excluded that information to make the problem more realistic and harder in terms of graph research. The dataset consists of 55K graphs for training, 5K graphs for validation and 10K for testing. Details and some illustrations of the dataset can be found in Appendix I.

We use 3 hidden graph convolution layers which have fixed 64,128,128 features respectively followed by a global mean operator as graph readout layer, and ended by a fully connected layer with 10 outputs corresponding to the number of classes. Implementation details and hyperparameter tuning can be found in Appendix J.

To understand the effect of graph convolution, we apply the tests on 3 different inputs: the first one uses node degree as feature, the second uses pixel values and the later use both information. Hyperparameters were tuned just in case of using both pixel value and node degree. The same hyperparameters were applied to other cases.

Table 1 gives the mean and standard deviation of the accuracy obtained over 10 runs on the test set, with different seed numbers. It is well known that the image version of the MNIST dataset can be processed by any ordinary CNN architecture, which is able to apply various filterings. Hence, we argue that superpixel graph of mnist is a good candidate to show if the graph data needs various kind of filtering. As seen in the Table 1, MLP and GCN cannot do significantly better than random classifier when using only node degree or pixel value as input. That means that the distribution of node degrees or pixel values has no significant meaning for classification. When both node degree and pixel values are given, the accuracy of GCN is increased, but remains behind the best result. GIN and GAT perform better than GCN in each case, but their performance remains behind those of ChebNet and CayleyNet which are spectral designed and the supports of which cover the spectrum.

# 6 FINAL REMARKS

In this paper, we have shown that most influential graph convolutions such as (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Velicković et al., 2018) operate as low-pass filters. Interestingly, while being restricted to low-pass filters, they obtain state-of-the-art performance on reference node classification problems such as Cora and CiteSeer (Yang et al., 2016). These good results on these particular problems are induced by the nature of the graphs to be processed. Indeed, citation network problems are inherently low-pass filtering problems, similarly to image segmentation problems, which are efficiently tackled by low-pass filtering.

It is worth noting that, if we use enough convolution kernels, the frequency response of ChebNet kernels (Defferrard et al., 2016; Levie et al., 2019) covers nearly all frequency profiles. However, these frequency responses are not specific to special bands of frequency. It means that they can act as high-pass filters, but not as Gabor-like special band-pass filters.

As a conclusion, we claim that graph convolutions are problem specific and not problem agnostic. To have problem agnostic solution, graph convolutions need to be able to produce plenty of different frequencies in output signal profile. Experiments conducted in Section 5 provided empirical results to validate the theoretical analysis conducted in this paper.
