# ABSTRACT

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive predictive performance due to their ability to learn complex, non-linear relationships between variables. However, the inability to effectively visualize these relationships has led to DNNs being characterized as black boxes and consequently limited their applications. To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed method: agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features, along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned are predictive. We introduce ACD using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet, in order to diagnose incorrect predictions, identify dataset bias, and extract polarizing phrases of varying lengths. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better trust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to adversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the input and ignores spurious noise.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently demonstrated impressive predictive performance due to their ability to learn complex, non-linear, relationships between variables. However, the inability to effectively visualize these relationships has led DNNs to be characterized as black boxes. Consequently, their use has been limited in fields such as medicine (e.g. medical image classification (Litjens et al., 2017)), policy-making (e.g. classification aiding public policy makers (Brennan & Oliver, 2013)), and science (e.g. interpreting the contribution of a stimulus to a biological measurement (Angermueller et al., 2016)). Moreover, the use of black-box models like DNNs in industrial settings has come under increasing scrutiny as they struggle with issues such as fairness (Dwork et al., 2012) and regulatory pressure (Goodman & Flaxman, 2016).

To ameliorate these problems, we introduce the use of hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions. Our proposed method, agglomerative contextual decomposition  $(\mathrm{ACD})^{1}$ , is a general technique that can be applied to a wide range of DNN architectures and data types. Given a prediction from a trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features, along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned are predictive (see Fig 1).

The development of ACD consists of two novel contributions. First, importance scores for groups of features are obtained by generalizing contextual decomposition (CD), a previous method for obtaining importance scores for LSTMs (Murdoch et al., 2018). This work extends CD to arbitrary DNN architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Second, we introduce the idea of hierarchical saliency, where a group-level importance measure, in this case CD, is used as a joining metric in an agglomerative clustering procedure. While we focus on DNNs and use CD as our importance measure, this concept is general, and could be readily applied to any model with a suitable measure for computing importances of groups of variables.

We demonstrate the utility of ACD on both long short term memory networks (LSTMs) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) trained on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) (Socher et al., 2013) and CNNs trained on MNIST (LeCun, 1998) and ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015). Through human experiments, we show that ACD produces intuitive visualizations that enable users to better reason about and trust DNNs. In particular, given two DNN models, we show that users can use the output of ACD to select the model with higher predictive accuracy, and that overall they rank ACD as more trustworthy than prior interpretation methods. In addition, we demonstrate that ACD's hierarchy is robust to adversarial perturbations (Szegedy et al., 2013) in CNNs.

Figure 1: ACD illustrated through the toy example of predicting the phrase "not very good" as negative. Given the network and prediction, ACD constructs a hierarchy of meaningful phrases and provides importance scores for each identified phrase. In this example, ACD identifies that "very" modifies "good" to become the very positive phrase "very good", which is subsequently negated by "not" to produce the negative phrase "not very good".

# 2 BACKGROUND

Interpreting DNNs is a growing field spanning a range of techniques including feature visualization (Olah et al., 2017; Yosinski et al., 2015), analyzing learned weights (Tsang et al., 2017) and others (Frosst & Hinton, 2017; Andreas et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). Our work focuses on local interpretations, where the task is to interpret individual predictions made by a DNN.

Local interpretation Most prior work has focused on assigning importance to individual features, such as pixels in an image or words in a document. There are several methods that give feature-level importance for different architectures. They can be categorized as gradient-based (Springenberg et al., 2014; Sundararajan et al., 2017; Selvaraju et al., 2016; Baehrens et al., 2010), decomposition-based (Murdoch & Szlam, 2017; Shrikumar et al., 2016; Bach et al., 2015) and others (Dabkowski & Gal, 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2016; Zintgraf et al., 2017), with many similarities among the methods (Ancona et al., 2018; Lundberg & Lee, 2017).

By contrast, there are relatively few methods that can extract the interactions between features that a DNN has learned. In the case of LSTMs, Murdoch et al. (2018) demonstrated the limitations of prior work on interpretation using word-level scores, and introduced contextual decomposition (CD), an algorithm for producing phrase-level importance scores from LSTMs. Another simple baseline is occlusion, where a group of features is set to some reference value, such as zero, and the importance of the group is defined to be the resulting decrease in the prediction value (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Li et al., 2016). Given an importance score for groups of features, no existing work addresses how to search through the many possible groups of variables in order to find a small set to show to users. To address this problem, this work introduces hierarchical interpretations as a principled way to search for and display important groups.

Hierarchical importance Results from psychology and philosophy suggest that people prefer explanations that are simple but informative (Harman, 1965; Read & Marcus-Newhall, 1993) and include the appropriate amount of detail (Keil, 2006). However, there is no existing work that is both powerful enough to capture interactions between features, and simple enough to not require a user to manually search through the large number of available feature groups. To remedy this, we propose a hierarchical clustering procedure to identify and visualize, out of the considerable number of feature groups, which ones contain meaningful interactions and should be displayed to the end user. In doing so, ACD aims to be informative enough to capture meaningful feature interactions while displaying a sufficiently small subset of all feature groups to maintain simplicity.

# 3 METHOD

This section introduces ACD through two contributions: Sec 3.1 proposes a generalization of CD from LSTMs to arbitrary DNNs, and Sec 3.2 explains how to combine these CD scores with hierarchical clustering to produce ACD.

# 3.1 CONTEXTUAL DECOMPOSITION (CD) IMPORTANCE SCORES FOR GENERAL DNNS

In order to generalize CD to a wider range of DNNs, we first reformulate the original CD algorithm into a more generic setting than originally presented. For a given DNN  $f(x)$ , we can represent its output as a SoftMax operation applied to logits  $g(x)$ . These logits, in turn, are the composition of  $L$  layers  $g_{i}$ , such as convolutional operations or ReLU non-linearities.

$$
f (x) = \operatorname {S o f t M a x} (g (x)) = \operatorname {S o f t M a x} \left(g _ {L} \left(g _ {L - 1} (\dots \left(g _ {2} (g _ {1} (x)))\right)\right)\right) \tag {1}
$$

Given a group of features  $\{x_{j}\}_{j\in S}$ , our generalized CD algorithm,  $g^{CD}(x)$ , decomposes the logits  $g(x)$  into a sum of two terms,  $\hat{\beta} (x)$  and  $\gamma (x)$ .  $\beta (x)$  is the importance measure of the feature group  $\{x_{j}\}_{j\in S}$ , and  $\gamma (x)$  captures contributions to  $g(x)$  not included in  $\beta (x)$ .

$$
g ^ {C D} (x) = (\beta (x), \gamma (x)) \tag {2}
$$

$$
\beta (x) + \gamma (x) = g (x) \tag {3}
$$

To compute the CD decomposition for  $g(x)$ , we define layer-wise CD decompositions  $g_{i}^{CD}(x) = (\beta_{i},\gamma_{i})$  for each layer  $g_{i}(x)$ . Here,  $\beta_{i}$  corresponds to the importance measure of  $\{x_j\}_{j\in S}$  to layer  $i$ , and  $\gamma_{i}$  corresponds to the contribution of the rest of the input to layer  $i$ . To maintain the decomposition we require  $\beta_{i} + \gamma_{i} = g_{i}(x)$  for each  $i$ . We then compute CD scores for the full network by composing these decompositions.

$$
g ^ {C D} (x) = g _ {L} ^ {C D} \left(g _ {L - 1} ^ {C D} \left(\dots \left(g _ {2} ^ {C D} \left(g _ {1} ^ {C D} (x)\right)\right)\right)\right) \tag {4}
$$

Previous work (Murdoch et al., 2018) introduced decompositions  $g_{i}^{CD}$  for layers used in LSTMs. The generalized CD described here extends CD to other widely used DNNs, by introducing layerwise CD decompositions for convolutional, max-pooling, ReLU non-linearity and dropout layers. Doing so generalizes CD scores from LSTMs to a wide range of neural architectures, including CNNs with residual and recurrent architectures. For more intuition see Supplement S1.

When  $g_{i}$  is a convolutional or fully connected layer, the layer operation consists of a weight matrix  $W$  and a bias  $b$ . The weight matrix can be multiplied with  $\beta_{i-1}$  and  $\gamma_{i-1}$  individually, but the bias must be partitioned between the two. We partition the bias proportionally based on the absolute value of the layer activations. For the convolutional layer, this equation yields only one activation of the output; it must be repeated for each activation.

$$
\beta_ {i} = W \beta_ {i - 1} + \frac {\left| W \beta_ {i - 1} \right|}{\left| W \beta_ {i - 1} \right| + \left| W \gamma_ {i - 1} \right|} \cdot b \tag {5}
$$

$$
\gamma_ {i} = W \gamma_ {i - 1} + \frac {\left| W \gamma_ {i - 1} \right|}{\left| W \beta_ {i - 1} \right| + \left| W \gamma_ {i - 1} \right|} \cdot b \tag {6}
$$

When  $g_{i}$  is a max-pooling layer, we identify the indices, or channels, selected by max-pool when run by  $g_{i}(x)$ , denoted max_idxs below, and use the decompositions for the corresponding channels.

$$
\max  _ {i d x s} = \operatorname {a r g m a x} _ {i d x s} [ \operatorname {m a x p o o l} \left(\beta_ {i - 1} + \gamma_ {i - 1}; i d x s\right) ] \tag {7}
$$

$$
\beta_ {i} = \beta_ {i - 1} [ \max _ {-} i d x s ] \tag {8}
$$

$$
\gamma_ {i} = \gamma_ {i - 1} [ \max _ {-} i d x s ] \tag {9}
$$

Finally, for the ReLU, we update our importance score  $\beta_{i}$  by computing the activation of  $\beta_{i-1}$  alone and then update  $\gamma_{i}$  by subtracting this from the total activation.

$$
\beta_ {i} = \operatorname {R e L U} \left(\beta_ {i - 1}\right) \tag {10}
$$

$$
\gamma_ {i} = \operatorname {R e L U} \left(\beta_ {i - 1} + \gamma_ {i - 1}\right) - \operatorname {R e L U} \left(\beta_ {i - 1}\right) \tag {11}
$$

For a dropout layer, we simply apply dropout to  $\beta_{i - 1}$  and  $\gamma_{i - 1}$  individually, or multiplying each by a scalar. Computationally, a CD call is comparable to a forward pass through the network  $f$ .

# 3.2 AGGLOMERATIVE CONTEXTUAL DECOMPOSITION (ACD)

Given the generalized CD scores introduced above, Algorithm 1 describes the agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure used to produce ACD interpretations. After initializing by computing the CD scores of each feature individually, the algorithm iteratively selects all groups of features within  $k\%$  of the highest-scoring group (where  $k$  is a hyperparameter, fixed at 95 for images and 90 for text) and adds them to the hierarchy.

Each time a new group is added to the hierarchy, a corresponding set of candidate groups is generated by adding individual contiguous features to the original group. For text, the candidate groups correspond to adding one adjacent word onto the current phrase, and for images adding any adjacent pixel onto the current image patch. Candidate groups are ranked according to the difference between the score of the candidate group and the score of the original group from which it was constructed.

ACD terminates after an application-specific criterion is met. For sentiment classification, we stop once all words are selected. For images, we stop after some predefined number of iterations and then merge the remaining groups one by one using the same selection criteria described above.

Algorithm 1 Agglomeration algorithm.  
ACD(Example x, model m, hyperparameter k, function CD(x, blob; model))  
# initialize  
tree = Tree() # tree to output  
scoresQueue = PriorityQueue() # scores, sorted by importance  
for feature in x :  
    scoresQueue.push(feature, priority=CD(x, feature; m))  
# iteratively build up tree  
while scoresQueue is not empty :  
    selectedGroups = scoresQueue.topKPercentile(k) # pop off top k elements  
tree.add(selectGroups)  
# generate new groups of features based on current groups and add them to the queue  
for selectedGroup in selectedGroups :  
    candidateGroups = getCandidateGroups(selectGroup)  
for candidateGroup in candidateGroups :  
    scoresQueue.add(candidateGroup, priority=CD(x, candidateGroup; m)-CD(x, selectedGroup; m))  
return tree

Algorithm 1 is not specific to DNNs; it requires only a method to obtain importance scores for groups of input features. Here, we use CD scores to arrive at the ACD algorithm, which makes the method specific to DNNs, but given a feature group scoring function, Algorithm 1 can yield interpretations for any predictive model. CD is a natural score to use for DNNs as it aggregates saliency at different scales and converges to the final prediction once all the units have been selected.

# 4 RESULTS

We now present empirical validation of ACD on both LSTMs trained on SST and CNNs trained on MNIST and ImageNet. First, we introduce the reader to our visualization in Sec 4.2, and how it can (anecdotally) be used to understand models in settings such as diagnosing incorrect predictions, identifying dataset bias, and identifying representative phrases of differing lengths. We then provide quantitative evidence of the benefits of ACD in Sec 4.3 through human experiments and demonstrating the stability of ACD to adversarial perturbations.

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

We first describe the process for training the models from which we produce interpretations. As the objective of this paper is to interpret the predictions of models, rather than increase their predictive accuracy, we use standard best practices to train our models. All models are implemented using PyTorch. For SST, we train a standard binary classification LSTM model², which achieves 86.2% accuracy. On MNIST, we use the standard PyTorch example³, which attains accuracy of 97.7%. On ImageNet, we use a pre-trained VGG-16 DNN architecture Simonyan & Zisserman (2014) which attains top-1 accuracy of 42.8%. When using ACD on ImageNet, for computational reasons, we start the agglomeration process with 14-by-14 superpixels instead of individual pixels. We also smooth the computed image patches by adding pixels surrounded by the patch. The weakened models for the human experiments are constructed from the original models by randomly permuting a small percentage of their weights. For SST/MNIST/ImageNet, 25/25/0.8% of weights are randomized, reducing test accuracy from 85.8/97.7/42.8% to 79.8/79.6/32.3%.

# 4.2 QUALITATIVE EXPERIMENTS

Before providing quantitative evidence of the benefits of ACD, we first introduce the visualization and demonstrate its utility in interpreting a predictive model's behavior. To qualitatively evaluate ACD, in Supplement S3 we show the results of several more examples selected using the same criterion as in our human experiments described below.

# 4.2.1 UNDERSTANDING PREDICTIVE MODELS USING ACD

In the following examples, we demonstrate the use of ACD to diagnose incorrect predictions in SST and identify dataset bias in ImageNet. These examples are only a few of the potential uses of ACD.

![](images/b32fd084fc08b16fde7863870d71621c1eeb12012b74e3c2593220009d33e974.jpg)  
Figure 2: ACD interpretation of an LSTM predicting sentiment. Blue is positive sentiment, white is neutral, red is negative. The bottom row displays CD scores for individual words in the sentence. Higher rows display important phrases identified by ACD, along with their CD scores, converging to the model's (incorrect) prediction in the top row. (Best viewed in color)

Text example - diagnosing incorrect predictions In the first example, we show the result of running ACD for our SST LSTM model in Figure 2. We can use this ACD visualization to quickly diagnose why the LSTM made an incorrect prediction. In particular, note that the ACD summary of the LSTM correctly identifies two longer phrases and their corresponding sentiment a great ensemble cast (positive) and  $n$ -t lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the ordinary (negative). It is only when these two phrases are joined that the LSTM inaccurately predicts a positive sentiment. This suggests that the LSTM has erroneously learned a positive interaction between these two phrases. Prior methods would not be capable of detecting this type of useful information.

Figure 3: ACD interpretation for a VGG network prediction, described in 4.2.1. ACD shows that the CNN is focusing on skates to predict the class "puck", indicating that the model has captured dataset bias. The top row shows the original image, logits for the five top-predicted classes, and the CD superpixel-level scores for those classes. The second row shows separate image patches ACD has identified as being independently predictive of the class "puck". Starting from the left, each image shows a successive iteration in the agglomeration procedure. The third row shows the CD scores for each of these patches, where patch colors in the second row correspond to line colors in the third row. ACD successfully finds important regions for the target class (such as the puck), and this importance increases as more pixels are selected. Best viewed in color.

Vision example - identifying dataset bias Fig 3 shows an example using ACD for an ImageNet VGG model. Using ACD, we can see that to predict "puck", the CNN is not just focusing on the puck in the image, but also on the hockey player's skates. Moreover, by comparing the fifth and sixth plots in the third row, we can see that the network is only able to distinguish between the class "puck" and the other top classes when the orange skate and green puck patches merge into a single orange patch. This suggests that the CNN has learned that skates are a strong corroborating features for pucks. While intuitively reasonable in the context of ImageNet, this may not be desirable behavior if the model were used in other domains.

# 4.2.2 IDENTIFYING TOP-SCORING PHRASES

When feasible, a common means of scrutinizing what a model has learned is to inspect its most important features, and interactions. In Table 1, we use ACD to show the top-scoring phrases of different lengths for our LSTM trained on SST. These phrases were extracted by running ACD separately on each sample in SST's validation set. The score of each phrase was then computed by averaging over the score it received in each occurrence in a ACD hierarchy. The extracted phrases are clearly reflective of the corresponding sentiment, providing additional evidence that ACD is able to capture meaningful positive and negative phrases. Additional phrases are given in Supplement S2.

# 4.3 QUANTITATIVE EXPERIMENTS

Having introduced our visualization and provided qualitative evidence of its uses, we now provide quantitative evidence of the benefits of ACD.

# 4.3.1 HUMAN EXPERIMENTS

We now demonstrate through human experiments that ACD allows users to better trust and reason about the accuracy of DNNs. Human subjects consist of eleven graduate students at the author's institution, each of whom has taken a class in machine learning. Each subject was asked to fill out a survey with two types of questions: whether, using ACD, they could identify the more accurate of two models and whether they trusted a models output. In both cases, similar questions were asked on three datasets (SST, MNIST and ImageNet), and ACD was compared against three baselines: CD (Murdoch et al., 2018), Integrated Gradients (IG) (Sundararajan et al., 2017), and occlusion (Li et al., 2016; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014). The exact survey prompts are provided in Supplement S4.

Identifying an accurate model The objective of this section was to determine if subjects could use a small number of interpretations produced by ACD in order to identify the more accurate of two models. For each question in this section, two example predictions were chosen. For each of these two predictions, subjects were given interpretations from two different models (four total), and asked to identify which of the two models had a higher predictive accuracy. Each subject was asked to make this comparison using three different sets of examples for each combination of dataset and interpretation method, for 36 total comparisons. To remove variance due to examples, the same three sets of examples were used across all four interpretation methods.

The predictions shown were chosen to maximize disagreement between models, with SST also being restricted to sentences between five and twenty words, for ease of visualization. To prevent subjects from simply picking the model that predicts more accurately for the given example, for each question a user is shown two examples: one where only the first model predicts correctly and one where only the second model predicts correctly. The two models considered were the accurate models of the previous section and a weakened version of that same model (details given in Sec 4.1).

Fig 4A shows the results of the survey. For SST, humans were better able to identify the strongly predictive model using ACD compared to other baselines, with only ACD and CD outperforming random selection (50%). In the simple setting of MNIST, ACD performs similarly to other methods. When applied to ImageNet, a more complex dataset, ACD substantially outperforms prior, non-hierarchical methods, and is the only method to outperform random chance.

Evaluating trust in a model In this section, the goal is to gauge whether ACD helps a subject to better trust a model's predictions, relative to prior techniques. For each question, subjects were shown interpretations of the same prediction using four different interpretation methods, and were asked to rank the interpretations from one to four based on how much they instilled trust in trust the

ACD achieves consistently high correlation across different attack types, indicating that ACD hierarchies are largely robust to adversarial attacks. Using occlusion in place of CD produces substantially less stable hierarchies.

model. Subjects were asked to do this ranking for three different examples in each dataset, for nine total rankings. The interpretations were produced from the more accurate model from the previous section, and the examples were chosen using the same criteria as the previous section, except they were restricted to examples correctly predicted by the more accurate model.

Fig 4B shows the average ranking received by each method/dataset pair. ACD substantially outperforms other baselines, particularly for ImageNet, achieving an average rank of 3.5 out of 4, where higher ranks are better. As in the prior question, we found that the hierarchy only provided benefits in the more complicated ImageNet setting, with results on MNIST inconclusive.

# 4.3.2 ACD HIERARCHY IS ROBUST TO ADVERSARIAL PERTURBATIONS

While there has been a considerable amount of work on adversarial attacks, little effort has been devoted to qualitatively understanding this phenomenon. In this section, we provide evidence that, on MNIST, the hierarchical clustering produced by ACD is largely robust to adversarial perturbations. This suggests that ACD's hierarchy captures fundamental features of an image, and is largely immune to the spurious noise favored by adversarial examples.

To measure the robustness of ACD's hierarchy, we first qualitatively compare the interpretations produced by ACD on both an unaltered image and an adversarially perturbed version of that image. Empirically, we found that the extracted hierarchies are often very similar, see Supplement S5. To generalize these observations, we introduce a metric to quantify the similarity between two ACD hierarchies. This metric allows us to make quantitative, dataset-level statements about the stability of ACD feature hierarchies with respect to adversarial inputs. Given an ACD hierarchy, we compute a ranking of the input image's pixels according to the order in which they were added to the hierarchy. To measure the similarity between the ACD hierarchies for original and adversarial images, we compute the correlation between their corresponding rankings. As ACD hierarchies are class-specific, we average the correlations for the original and adversarially altered predictions.

We display the correlations for five different attacks (computed using the Foolbox package Rauber et al. (2017), examples shown in Supplement S6), each averaged over 100 randomly chosen predictions, in Table 2. As ACD is the first local interpretation technique to compute a hierarchy, there is little prior work available for comparison. As a baseline, we use our agglomeration algorithm with occlusion in place of CD. The resulting correlations are substantially lower, indicating that features detected by ACD are more stable to adversarial attacks than comparable methods. These results provide evidence that ACD's hierarchy captures fundamental features of an image, and is largely immune to the spurious noise favored by adversarial examples.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this work, we introduce agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD), a novel hierarchical interpretation algorithm. ACD is the first method to use a hierarchy to interpret individual neural network predictions. Doing so enables ACD to automatically detect and display non-linear contributions to individual DNN predictions, something prior interpretation methods are unable to do. The benefits of capturing the non-linearities inherent in DNNs are demonstrated through human experiments and examples of diagnosing incorrect predictions and dataset bias. We also demonstrate that ACD's hierarchy is robust to adversarial perturbations in CNNs, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the input and ignores spurious noise.
