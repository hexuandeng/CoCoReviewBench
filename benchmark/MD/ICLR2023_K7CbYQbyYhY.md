# ABSTRACT

Gradient-based learning algorithms have an implicit simplicity bias which in effect can limit the diversity of predictors being sampled by the learning procedure. This behavior can hinder the transferability of trained models by (i) favoring the learning of simpler but spurious features — present in the training data but absent from the test data — and (ii) by only leveraging a small subset of predictive features. Such an effect is especially magnified when the test distribution does not exactly match the train distribution—referred to as the Out of Distribution (OOD) generalization problem. However, given only the training data, it is not always possible to apriori assess if a given feature is spurious or transferable. Instead, we advocate for learning an ensemble of models which capture a diverse set of predictive features. Towards this, we propose a new algorithm D-BAT (Diversity-By-disAgreement Training), which enforces agreement among the models on the training data, but disagreement on the OOD data. We show how D-BAT naturally emerges from the notion of generalized discrepancy, as well as demonstrate in multiple experiments how the proposed method can mitigate shortcut-learning, enhance uncertainty and OOD detection, as well as improve transferability.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

While gradient-based learning algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), are nowadays ubiquitous in the training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), it is well known that the resulting models are (i) brittle when exposed to small distribution shifts (Beery et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2016; Amodei et al., 2016), (ii) can easily be fooled by small adversarial perturbations (Szegedy et al., 2014), (iii) tend to pick up spurious correlations (McCoy et al., 2019; Oakden-Rayner et al., 2020; Geirhos et al., 2020) — present in the training data but absent from the downstream task —, as well as (iv) fail to provide adequate uncertainty estimates (Kim et al., 2016; van Amersfoort et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021b). Recently those learning algorithms have been investigated for their implicit bias toward simplicity — known as Simplicity Bias (SB), seen as one of the reasons behind their superior generalization properties (Arpit et al., 2017; Dziugaite & Roy, 2017). While for deep neural networks, simpler decision boundaries are often seen as less likely to overfit, Shah et al. (2020), Pezeshki et al. (2021) demonstrated that the SB can still cause the aforementioned issues. In particular, they show how the SB can be extreme, compelling predictors to rely only on the simplest feature available, despite the presence of equally or even more predictive complex features.

Its effect is greatly increased when we consider the more realistic out of distribution (OOD) setting (Ben-Tal et al., 2009), in which the source and target distributions are different, known to be a challenging problem (Sagawa et al., 2020; Krueger et al., 2021). The difference between the two domains can be categorized into either a distribution shift — e.g. a lack of samples in certain parts of the data manifold due to limitations of the data collection pipeline —, or as simply having completely different distributions. In the first case, the SB in its extreme form would increase the chances of learning to rely on spurious features — shortcuts not generalizing to the target distribution. Classic manifestations of this in vision applications are when models learn to rely mostly on textures or backgrounds instead of more complex and likely more generalizable semantic features such as using shapes (Beery et al., 2018; Ilyas et al., 2019; Geirhos et al., 2020). In the second instance, by relying only on the simplest feature, and being invariant to more complex ones, the SB would cause confident predictions (low uncertainty) on completely OOD samples. This even if complex features are contradicting simpler ones. Which brings us to our goal of deriving a method which can (i) learn

Figure 1: Example of applying D-BAT on a simple 2D toy example similar to the LMS-5 dataset introduced by Shah et al. (2020). The two classes, red and blue, can easily be separated by a vertical boundary decision. Other ways to separate the two classes — with horizontal lines for instance — are more complex., i.e. they require more hyperplanes. The simplicity bias will push models to systematically learn the simpler feature, as in the second column (b). Using D-BAT, we are able to learn the model in column (c), relying on a more complex boundary decision, effectively overcoming the simplicity bias. The ensemble  $h_{\text{ens}}(x) = h_1(x) + h_2(x)$ , in column (d), outputs a flat distribution at points where the two models disagree, effectively maximizing the uncertainty at those points. In this experiments the samples from  $\mathcal{D}_{\text{ood}}$  were obtained through computing adversarial perturbations, see App. D.2 for more details.

(d) ensemble

more transferable features, better suited to generalize despite distribution shifts, and (ii) provides accurate uncertainty estimates also for OOD samples.

We aim to achieve those two objectives through learning an ensemble of diverse predictors  $(h_1,\ldots ,h_K)$ , with  $h:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{Y}$ , and  $K$  being the ensemble size. Suppose that our training data is drawn from the distribution  $\mathcal{D}$ , and  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  is the distribution of OOD data on which we will be tested. Importantly,  $\mathcal{D}$  and  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  may have non-overlapping support, and  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  is not known during training. Our proposed method, D-BAT (Diversity-By-disAgreement Training), relies on the following idea:

Diverse hypotheses should agree on the source distribution  $\mathcal{D}$  while disagreeing on the OOD distribution  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$ .

Intuitively, a set of hypotheses should agree on what is known i.e. on  $\mathcal{D}$ , while formulating different interpretations of what is not known, i.e. on  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$ . Even if each individual predictor might be wrongly confident on OOD samples, while predicting different outcomes — the resulting uncertainty of the ensemble on those samples will be increased. Disagreement on  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$  can itself be enough to promote learning diverse representations of instances of  $\mathcal{D}$ . In the context of object detection, if one model  $h_1$  is relying on textures only, this model will generate predictions on  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$  based on textures, when enforcing disagreement on  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$ , a second model  $h_2$  would be discouraged to use textures in order to disagree with  $h_1$  — and consequently look for a different hypothesis to classify instances of  $\mathcal{D}$  e.g. using shapes. This process is illustrated in Fig. 2. A 2D direct application of our algorithm can be seen in Fig. 1. Once trained, the ensemble can either be used by forming a weighted average of the probability distribution from each hypothesis, or by tuning the weights on a downstream task.

Contributions. Our results can be summarized as:

- We introduce D-BAT, a simple yet efficient novel diversity-inducing regularizer which enables training ensembles of diverse predictors.  
- We provide a proof, in a simplified setting, that D-BAT promotes diversity, encouraging the models to utilize different predictive features.  
- We show on several datasets of varying complexity how the induced diversity can help to (i) tackle shortcut learning, and (ii) improve uncertainty estimation and transferability.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Diversity in ensembles. It is intuitive that in order to gain from ensembling several predictors  $h_1, \dots, h_K$ , those should be diverse. The bias-variance-covariance decomposition (Ueda & Nakano,

1996), which generalizes the bias variance decomposition to ensembles, shows how the error decreases with the covariance of the members of the ensemble. Despite its importance, there is still no well accepted definition and understanding of diversity, and it is often derived from prediction errors of members of the ensemble (Zhou, 2012). This creates a conflict between trying to increase accuracy of individual predictors  $h$ , and trying to increase diversity. In this view, creating a good ensemble is seen as striking a good balance between individual performance and diversity. To promote diversity in ensembles, a classic approach is to add stochasticity into the training by using different subsets of the training data for each predictor (Breiman, 1996), or using different data augmentation methods (Stickland & Murray, 2020). Another approach is to add orthogonality constrains on the predictor's gradient (Ross et al., 2020; Kariyappa & Qureshi, 2019). Recently, the information bottleneck (Tishby et al., 2000) has been used to promote ensemble diversity (Rame & Cord, 2021; Sinha et al., 2021). Unlike the aforementioned methods, D-BAT can be trained on the full dataset, it importantly does not set constrains the output of in-distribution samples, but on a separate OOD distribution. Furthermore, as opposed to Sinha et al. (2021), our individual predictors do not share the same encoder.

Simplicity bias. While the simplicity bias, by promoting simpler decision boundary, can act as an implicit regularizer and improves generalization (Arpit et al., 2017; Gunasekar et al., 2018), it is also contributing to the brittleness of gradient-based machine-leaning (Shah et al., 2020). Recently Teney et al. (2021) proposed to evade the simplicity bias by adding gradient orthogonality constraints, not at the output level, but at an intermediary hidden representation obtained after a shared and fixed encoder. While their results are promising, the reliance on a pre-trained encoder limits the type of features that can be used to the set of features extracted by the encoder, especially, if a feature was already discarded by the encoder due to SB, it is effectively lost. In contrast, our method is not relying on a pre-trained encoder, also comparatively require a very small ensemble size to counter the simplicity bias. A more detailed comparison with D-BAT is provided in App F.1.

Shortcut learning. The failures of DNNs across application domains due to shortcut learning have been documented extensively in (Geirhos et al., 2020). They introduce a taxonomy of predictors distinguishing between (i) predictors which can be learnt from the training algorithms (ii) predictors performing well on in-distribution training data, (iii) predictors performing well on in-distribution test data, and finally (iv) predictors performing well on in-distribution and OOD test data. The last category being the intended solutions. In our experiments, by learning diverse predictors, D-BAT increases the chance of finding one solution generalizing to both in and out of distribution test data, see § 4.1 for more details.

OOD generalization. Generalizing to distributions not seen during training is accomplished by two approaches: robust training, and invariant learning. In the former, the test distribution is assumed to be within a set of known plausible distributions (say  $\mathcal{U}$ ). Then, robust training minimizes the loss over the worst possible distribution in  $\mathcal{U}$  (Ben-Tal et al., 2009). Numerous approaches exist to defining the set  $\mathcal{U}$  - see survey by (Rahimian & Mehrotra, 2019). Most recently, Sagawa et al. (2020) model the set of plausible domains as the convex hull over predefined subgroups of datapoints and Krueger et al. (2021) extend this by taking affine combinations beyond the convex hull. Our approach also borrows from this philosophy - when we do not know the labels of the OOD data, we assume the worst case and try predict as diverse labels as possible. This is similar to the notion of discrepancy introduced in domain adaptation theory (Mansour et al., 2009; Cortes & Mohri, 2011; Cortes et al., 2019). A different line of work defines a set of environments and asks that our outputs be 'invariant' (i.e. indistinguishable) among the different environments (Bengio et al., 2013; Arjovsky et al., 2019; Koyama & Yamaguchi, 2020). When only a single training environment is present, like in our setting, this is akin to adversarial domain adaptation. Here, the data of one domain is modified to be indistinguishable to the other (Ganin et al., 2016; Long et al., 2017). However, this approach is fundamentally limited. E.g. in Fig. 2 a model which classifies both the crane and the porcupine as a crane is invariant, but incorrect. Furthermore, it is worth noting that prior work in OOD generalization are often considering datasets where the spurious feature is not fully predictive in the training distribution (Zhang et al., 2021; Saito et al., 2017; 2018; Nam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a), and fail in our challenging settings of § 4.1 (see App. F for more in-depth comparisons). Lastly, parallel to our work, Lee et al. (2022) adopt a similar approach and improve OOD generalization by minimizing the mutual information on unlabeled target data between pairs of predictors. However, their work does not investigate uncertainty estimation and is not motivated by domain adaptation theory as ours is (Mansour et al., 2009), see App. F.7 for a more in-depth comparison.

Figure 2: Illustration of how D-BAT can promote learning diverse features. Consider the task of classifying bird pictures among several classes. The red color represents the attention of a first model  $h_1$ . This model learnt to use some simple yet discriminative feature to recognise an African Crowned Crane on the left. Now suppose we use the top image  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  on which the models must disagree.  $h_2$  cannot again use the same feature as  $h_1$  since then it will not disagree on  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$ . Instead,  $h_2$  would look for other distinctive features of the crane which are not present on the right e.g. using its beak and red throat pouch.

Uncertainty estimation. DNNs are notoriously unable to provide reliable confidence estimates, which is impeding the progress of the field in safety critical domains (Begoli et al., 2019), as well as hurting models interpretability (Kim et al., 2016). To improve the confidence estimates of DNNs, Gal & Ghahramani (2016) propose to use dropout at inference time, a method referred to as MC-Dropout. Other popular methods used for uncertainty estimation are Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) (Hernández-Lobato & Adams, 2015) and Gaussian Processes (Rasmussen & Williams, 2005). All those methods but gaussian processes, were recently shown to fail to adequately provide high uncertainty estimates on OOD samples away from the boundary decision (van Amersfoort et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021b). We show in our experiments how D-BAT can help to associate high uncertainty to those samples by maximizing the disagreement outside of  $\mathcal{D}$  (see § 4.2, as well as Fig.1).

Figure 3: If  $h_1$  is computed by minimizing the training loss on  $\mathcal{D}$ , its loss on the OOD task  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$  may be very large i.e.  $h_1$  may be very far from the optimal OOD model  $h_{\mathrm{odd}}$  as measured by  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}} (h_1, h_{\mathrm{odd}})$  (left). To mitigate this, we propose to learn a diverse ensemble  $\{h_1, \ldots, h_4\}$  which is maximally 'spread-out' (with distance measured using  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}} (\cdot, \cdot)$ ) and cover the entire space of possible solutions  $\mathcal{H}_t^\star$ . This minimizes the distance between the unknown  $h_{\mathrm{odd}}$  and our learned ensemble, ensuring we learn transferable features with good performance on  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$ .

We will first define some notation and explain why standard training fails for OOD generalization. Then, we introduce the concept of discrepancy which will motivate our D-BAT algorithm.

Setup. Let us formally define the OOD problem.  $\mathcal{X}$  is the input space,  $\mathcal{V}$  the output space, we define a domain as a pair of a distribution over  $\mathcal{X}$  and a labeling function  $h:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{V}$ . Given any distribution  $\mathcal{D}$  over  $\mathcal{X}$ , given two labeling functions  $h_1$  and  $h_2$ , given a loss function  $L:\mathcal{Y}\times \mathcal{Y}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+}$ , we define the expected loss as the expectation:  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{D}}(h_1,h_2) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mathcal{D}}[L(h_1(x),h_2(x))]$ .

Now, suppose that the training data is drawn from the distribution  $(\mathcal{D}_t, h_t)$ , but we will be tested on a different distribution  $(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}, h_{\mathrm{odd}})$ . While the labelling function  $h_{\mathrm{odd}}$  is unknown, we assume that we have access to unlabelled samples from  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$ .

Finally, let  $\mathcal{H}$  be the set of all labelling functions i.e. the set of all possible prediction models. And further define  $\mathcal{H}_t^\star$  and  $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{odd}}^{\star}$  to be the optimal labelling functions on the train and the OOD domains:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{t}^{\star}:= \operatorname *{arg  min}_{h\in \mathcal{H}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{D}_{t}}(h,h_{\mathrm{t}}),\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{odd}}^{\star}:= \operatorname *{arg  min}_{h\in \mathcal{H}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}}(h,h_{\mathrm{odd}}).
$$

We assume that there exists an ideal transferable function  $h^{\star} \in \mathcal{H}_t^\star \cap \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{odd}}^\star$ . This assumption captures the reality that the training task and the OOD testing task are closely related to each other. Otherwise, we would not expect any OOD generalization.

Beyond standard training. Just using the training data, standard training would train a model  $h_{\mathrm{ERM}} \in \mathcal{H}_t^\star$ . However, as we discussed in the introduction, if we use gradient descent to find the ERM solution, then  $h_{\mathrm{ERM}}$  will likely be the simplest model i.e. it will likely pick up spurious correlations in  $\mathcal{D}_t$  which are not present in  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$ . Thus, the error on OOD data might be very high

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} \left(h _ {\text {E R M}}, h _ {\mathrm {o o d}}\right) \leq \max  _ {h \in \mathcal {H} _ {t} ^ {\star}} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} \left(h, h _ {\mathrm {o o d}}\right).
$$

Instead, we would ideally like to minimize the right hand side in order to find  $h^{\star}$ . The main difficulty is that we do not have access to the OOD labels  $h_{\mathrm{odd}}$ . So we can instead use the following proxy:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} \left(h _ {1}, h _ {\mathrm {o o d}}\right) = \max  _ {h _ {2} \in \mathcal {H} _ {t} ^ {\star} \cap \mathcal {H} _ {\mathrm {o o d}} ^ {\star}} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} \left(h _ {1}, h _ {2}\right) \leq \max  _ {h _ {2} \in \mathcal {H} _ {t} ^ {\star}} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} \left(h _ {1}, h _ {2}\right)
$$

In the above we used the fact that  $\mathcal{H}_t^\star \cap \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{odd}}^\star$  is non-empty. Recall that  $\mathcal{H}_t^\star = \arg \min_{h\in \mathcal{H}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{D}_t}(h,h_\mathrm{t})$ . So this means we want to pick  $h_2$  to minimize our training data (i.e. belong to  $\mathcal{H}_t^\star$ ), but otherwise maximally disagree with  $h_1$  on the OOD data — this process is illustrated in Fig. 3. The latter is closely related to the concept of discrepancy in domain-adaption (Mansour et al., 2009; Cortes et al., 2019). However, the main difference between the definitions is that we restrict the maximum to the set of  $\mathcal{H}_t^\star$ , whereas the standard notions use an unrestricted maximum. Thus, our version is tighter when the train and OOD tasks are closely related.

Deriving D-BAT. We make two final changes to the discrepancy term above to derive D-BAT. First, if  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{D}}(h_1,h_2)$  is a loss function which quantifies dis-agreement, then suppose we have another loss function  $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{D}}(h_1,h_2)$  which quantifies agreement. Then, we can minimize agreement instead of maximizing dis-agreement

$$
\operatorname *{arg  min}_{h_{2}\in \mathcal{H}_{t}^{\star}}\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{D}}(h_{1},h_{2}) = \operatorname *{arg  max}_{h_{2}\in \mathcal{H}_{t}^{\star}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{D}}(h_{1},h_{2}).
$$

Secondly, we relax the constrained formulation  $h_2 \in \mathcal{H}_t^\star$  by adding a penalty term with weight  $\alpha$  as

$$
h _ {\mathrm {D - B A T}} \in \min  _ {h _ {2} \in \mathcal {H}} \underbrace {\mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {t}} (h _ {2} , h _ {t})} _ {\text {f i t t r a i n d a t a}} + \alpha \underbrace {\mathcal {A} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} (h _ {1} , h _ {2})} _ {\text {d i s a g r e e o n O O D}}.
$$

The above is the core of our D-BAT procedure - given a first model  $h_1$ , we train a second model  $h_2$  to fit the training data  $\mathcal{D}$  while disagreeing with  $h_1$  on  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$ . Thus, we have

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} (h _ {1}, h _ {\mathrm {o o d}}) \leq \max _ {h _ {2} \in \mathcal {H} _ {t} ^ {\star}} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} (h _ {1}, h _ {2}) \approx \mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} (h _ {1}, h _ {\mathrm {D - B A T}}),
$$

implying that D-BAT gives us a good proxy for the unknown OOD loss, and can be used for uncertainty estimation. Following a similar argument for  $h_1$ , we arrive the following training procedure:

$$
\min _ {h _ {1}, h _ {2}} \frac {1}{2} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {t}} \left(h _ {1}, h _ {t}\right) + \mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {t}} \left(h _ {2}, h _ {t}\right)\right) + \alpha \mathcal {A} _ {\mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} \left(h _ {1}, h _ {2}\right).
$$

However, we found the training dynamics for simultaneously learning  $h_1$  and  $h_2$  to be unstable. Hence, we propose a sequential variant which we describe next.

# 3.2 ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

Binary classification formulation. Concretely given a binary classification task, with  $\mathcal{V} = \{0,1\}$ , we train two models sequentially. The training of the first model  $h_1$  is done in a classical way, minimizing its empirical classification loss  $\mathcal{L}(h_1(\boldsymbol{x}),y)$  over samples  $(\boldsymbol{x},y)$  from  $\hat{\mathcal{D}}$ . Once  $h_1$  trained, we train the second model  $h_2$  adding a term  $\mathcal{A}_{\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}} (h_1,h_2)$  representing the agreement on samples  $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}$  of  $\hat{\mathcal{D}}_{\mathrm{odd}}$ , with some weight  $\alpha \geq 0$ :

$$
h _ {2} ^ {\star} \in \underset {h _ {2} \in \mathcal {H}} {\operatorname {a r g m i n}} \frac {1}{N} \Big (\sum_ {(\boldsymbol {x}, y) \in \hat {\mathcal {D}}} \mathcal {L} (h _ {2} (\boldsymbol {x}), y) + \alpha \sum_ {\tilde {\boldsymbol {x}} \in \hat {\mathcal {D}} _ {\mathrm {o o d}}} \mathcal {A} _ {\tilde {\boldsymbol {x}}} (h _ {1}, h _ {2}) \Big)
$$

Given  $p_{h,\boldsymbol{x}}^{(y)}$  the probability of class  $y$  predicted by  $h$  given  $\boldsymbol{x}$ , the agreement  $\mathcal{A}_{\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}} (h_1, h_2)$  is defined as:

$$
\mathcal {A} _ {\tilde {\boldsymbol {x}}} \left(h _ {1}, h _ {2}\right) = - \log \left(p _ {h _ {1}, \tilde {\boldsymbol {x}}} ^ {(0)} \cdot p _ {h _ {2}, \tilde {\boldsymbol {x}}} ^ {(1)} + p _ {h _ {1}, \tilde {\boldsymbol {x}}} ^ {(1)} \cdot p _ {h _ {2}, \tilde {\boldsymbol {x}}} ^ {(0)}\right) \tag {AG}
$$

The binary classification formulation of D-BAT is straightforward and can be seen in App. B.

Multi-class classification formulation. The previous formulation requires a distribution over two labels in order to compute the agreement term (AG). We extend the agreement term  $\mathcal{A}(h_1, h_2, \tilde{\boldsymbol{x}})$  to the multi-class setting by binarizing the softmax distributions  $h_1(\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}})$  and  $h_2(\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}})$ . A simple way to do this is to take as positive class the predicted class of  $h_1$ :  $\tilde{y} = \mathrm{argmax}(h_1(\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}))$  with associated probability  $p_{h_1, \tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}}^{(\tilde{y})}$ , while grouping the remaining complementary class probabilities in a negative class  $\neg \tilde{y}$ . We would then have  $p_{h_1, \tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}}^{(\neg \tilde{y})} = 1 - p_{h_1, \tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}}^{(\tilde{y})}$ . We can then use the same bins to binarize the softmax distribution of the second model  $h_2(\tilde{x})$ . Another similarly sound approach would be to do the opposite and use the predicted class of  $h_2$  instead of  $h_1$ . In our experiments both approaches performed well. In Alg.2 we show the second approach, which is a bit more computationally efficient in the case of ensembles of more than 2 predictors, as the binarization bins are built only once, instead of building them for each pair  $(h_i, h_m)$  for  $0 \leq i < m$ .

# 3.3 LEARNING DIVERSE FEATURES

It is possible, under some simplifying assumptions to rigorously prove that minimizing  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{D - BAT}}$  results in learning predictors which use diverse features. We introduce the following theorem:

Theorem 3.1 (D-BAT favors diversity). Given a joint source distribution  $\mathcal{D}$  of triplets of random variables  $(C, S, Y)$  taking values in  $\{0, 1\}^3$ . Assuming  $\mathcal{D}$  has the following PMF:  $\mathbb{P}_{\mathcal{D}}(C = c, S = s, Y = y) = 1/2$  if  $c = s = y$ , and 0 otherwise, which intuitively corresponds to experiments §4.1 in which two features (e.g. color and shape) are equally predictive of the label  $y$ . Assuming a first model learnt the posterior distribution  $\mathbb{P}_1(Y = 1 \mid C = c, S = s) = c$ , meaning that it is invariant to feature  $s$ . Given a distribution  $\mathcal{D}_{\text{odd}}$  uniform over  $\{0, 1\}^3$  outside of the support of  $\mathcal{D}$ , the posterior solving the D-BAT objective will be  $\mathbb{P}_2(Y = 1 \mid C = c, S = s) = s$ , invariant to feature  $c$ .

The proof is provided in App. C. It crucially relies on the fact that  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$  has positive weight on data points which only contain the alternative feature  $s$ , or only contain the feature  $c$ . Thus, as long as  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$  is supported on a diverse enough dataset with features present in different combinations (what we refer to as counterfactual correlations), we can expect D-BAT to learn models which utilize a variety of such features.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We conduct two main types of experiments, (i) we evaluate how D-BAT can mitigate shortcut learning, bypassing simplicity bias, and generalize to OOD distributions, and (ii) we test the uncertainty estimation and OOD detection capabilities of D-BAT models.

# 4.1 OOD GENERALIZATION AND AVOIDING SHORTCUTS

We estimate our method's ability to avoid spurious correlation and learn more transferable features on 6 different datasets. In this setup, we use a labelled training data  $\mathcal{D}$  which might have a lot of highly correlated spurious features, and an unlabelled perturbation dataset  $\mathcal{D}_{\text{ood}}$ . We then test the performance on the learnt model on a test dataset. This test dataset may be drawn from the same distribution as  $\mathcal{D}_{\text{ood}}$  (which tests how well D-BAT avoids spurious features), as well as from a completely different distribution from  $\mathcal{D}_{\text{ood}}$  (which tests if D-BAT generalizes to new domains). We compare the performance of D-BAT against ERM, both when used to obtain a single model or an ensemble.

Our results are summarized in Tab. 1. For each dataset, we report both the best-model accuracy and — when applicable — the best-ensemble accuracy. All experiments in Tab. 1 are with an ensemble of size 2. Among the two models of the ensemble, the best model is selected according to its validation accuracy. We show results for a larger ensemble size of 5 in Fig. 4. Finally in Fig. 4 C (right) we compare the performance of D-BAT against numerous other baseline methods. See Appendix D for additional details on the setup as well as numerous other results.

Training data  $(\mathcal{D})$ . We consider two kinds of training data: synthetic datasets with completely spurious correlation, and more real world datasets where do not have any control and naturally may have some spurious features. We use the former to have a controlled setup, and the latter to judge our performance in the real world.

Table 1: Test accuracies on the six datasets described in § 4.1. For each dataset, we compare single model and ensemble test accuracies for D-BAT and ERM. In the left column we consider the scenario where  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  is also our test distribution (we can imagine we have access to unlabeled data from the test distribution). In the right column we consider  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  and our test distribution to be different, e.g. belonging to different domains. see § 4.1 for more details and a summary of our findings. In bold are the best scores along with any score within standard deviation reach. For datasets with completely spurious correlations, as we know ERM models would fail to learn anything generalizable, we are not interested in using them in an ensemble, hence the missing values for those datasets.

Datasets with completely spurious correlation: To know whether we learn a shortcut, and estimate our method's ability to overcome the SB, we design three datasets of varying complexity with known shortcut in a similar fashion as Teney et al. (2021). The Colored-MNIST, or C-MNIST for short, consists of MNIST (Lecun & Cortes, 1998) images for which the color and the shape of the digits are equally predictive, i.e. all the 1 are pink, all the 5 are orange, etc. The color being simpler to learn than the shape, the simplicity bias will result in models trained on this dataset to rely solely on the color information while being invariant to the shape information. This dataset is a multiclass dataset with 10 classes. The test distribution consists of images where the label is carried by the shape of the digit and the color is random. Following a similar idea, we build the M/F-Dominoes (M/F-D) dataset by concatenating MNIST images of 0s and 1s with Fashion-MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017) images of coats and dresses. The source distribution consists in images where the MNIST and F-MNIST parts are equally predicite of the label. In the test distribution, the label is carried by the F-MNIST part and the MNIST part is a 0 or 1 MNIST image picked at random. The M/C-Dominoes (M/C-D) dataset is built in the same way concatenating MNIST digits 0s and 1s with CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) images of cars and trucks. See App. E to see samples from those datasets.

Natural datasets: To test our method in this more general case we run further experiments on three well-known domain adaptation datasets. We use the Waterbirds (Sagawa et al., 2020) and Camelyon17 (Bandi et al., 2018) datasets from the WILDS collection (Koh et al., 2021). Camelyon17 is an image dataset for cancer detection, where different hospital each provide a unique data part. For those two binary classification datasets, the test distributions are taken to be the pre-defined test splits. We also use the Office-Home dataset from Venkateswara et al. (2017), which consists of images of 65 item categories across 4 domains: Art, Product, Clipart, and Real-World. In our experiments we merge the Product and Clipart domains to use as training, and test on the Real-World domain.

Perturbation data  $(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}})$ . As mentioned previously, we consider two scenarios in which the test distribution is (i) drawn from the same distribution as  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$ , or (ii) drawn from a completely different distribution. In practice, in the later case, we keep the test distribution unchanged and modify  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$ . For the C-MNIST, we remove digits 5 to 9 from the training and test distributions and build  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  based on those digits associated with random colors. For M/F-D and M/C-D datasets, we build  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  by concatenating MNIST images of 0 and 1 with F-MNNIST, — respectively CIFAR-10 — categories which are not used in the training distribution (i.e. anything but coats and dresses, resp. trucks and cars), samples from those distributions are in App. E. For the Camelyon17 medical imaging dataset, we use unlabeled validation data instead of unlabeled test data, both coming from different hospitals. For the Office-Home dataset, we use the left-out Art domain as  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$ .

# Results and discussion.

- D-BAT can tackle extreme spurious correlations. This is unlike prior methods from domain adaptation (Zhang et al., 2021; Saito et al., 2017; 2018; Nam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a) which all fail when the spurious feature is completely correlated with the label, see App. F for an extended discussion and comparison in which we show those methods cannot improve upon ERM in that

Figure 4: All results are in the "D<sub>od</sub> = test data" setting. (a) and (b): Test accuracies as a function of the ensemble size for both D-BAT and Deep Ensembles (ERM ensembles). We observe a significant advantage of D-BAT on both the Waterbirds and the Office-Home datasets. The difference is especially visible on the Waterbirds dataset, which has a stronger spurious correlation. Results have been obtained averaging over 3 seeds for the Waterbirds dataset and 6 seeds for the Office-Home dataset.

scenario. First we look at results without D-BAT for the C-MNIST, M/F-D and M/C-D datasets in Tab. 1. Looking at the ERM column, we observe how the test accuracies are near random guessing. This is a verification that without D-BAT, due to the simplicity bias, only the simplest feature is leveraged to predict the label and the models fail to generalize to domains for which the simple feature is spurious. D-BAT however, is effectively promoting models to use diverse features. This is demonstrated by the test accuracies of the best D-BAT model being significantly higher than of ERM.

- D-BAT improves generalization to new domains. In Tab. 1, when focusing on the case  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}} \neq$  test data, we observe that despite the differences between  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$  and the test distribution (e.g. the target distribution for M/C-D is using CIFAR-10 images of cars and trucks whereas  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{odd}}$  uses images of frogs, cats, etc. but no cars or trucks), D-BAT is still able to increase the generalization to the test domain.  
- Improved generalization on natural datasets. We observe a significant improvement in test accuracy for all our natural datasets. While the improvement is limited for the Office home dataset when considering a single model, we observe D-BAT ensembles nonetheless outperform ERM ensembles. The improvement is especially evident on the Camelyon17 dataset where D-BAT outperforms many known methods as seen in Fig. 4.c.  
- Ensembles built using D-BAT generalize better. In Fig. 4 we observe how D-BAT ensembles trained on the Waterbirds and Office-Home datasets generalize better.

# 4.2 BETTER UNCERTAINTY & OOD DETECTION

MNIST setup. We run two experiments to investigate D-BAT's ability to provide good uncertainty estimates. The first one is similar to the MNIST experiment in Liu et al. (2021b), it consists in learning to differentiate MNIST digits 0s from 1s. The uncertainty of the model — computed as the entropy — is then estimated for fake interpolated images of the form  $t \cdot 1 + (1 - t) \cdot 0$  for  $t \in [-1,2]$ . An ideal model would assign (i) low uncertainty values for  $t$  near 0 and 1, corresponding to in-distribution samples, while (ii) high uncertainty values elsewhere. (Liu et al., 2021b) showed how only Gaussian Processes are able to fulfill those two conditions, most models failing in attributing high uncertainty away from the boundary decision (as it can also be seen in Fig. 1 when looking at individual models). We train ensembles of size 2 and average over 20 seeds. For D-BAT, we use as  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  the remaining (OOD) digits 2 to 9, along with some random cropping. We use a LeNet.

MNIST results. Results in Fig. 5 suggest that D-BAT is able to give reliable uncertainty estimates for OOD datapoints, even when those samples are away from the boundary decision. This is in sharp contrast with deep-ensemble which only models uncertainty near the boundary decision.

CIFAR-10 setup. We train ensembles of 4 models and benchmark three different methods in their ability to identify what they do not know. For this we look at the histograms of the probability of their

![](images/4f416740f6d61b2b4acf34cab91ede6f93cadba5e928b23b3a2f670117b32ab1.jpg)  
Figure 5: Entropy of ensembles of two models trained with and without D-BAT (deep-ensemble), for inputs  $x$  taken from along line  $t \cdot 1 + (1 - t) \cdot 0$  for  $t \in [-1,2]$ . In-distribution samples are obtained for  $t \in \{0,1\}$ . All ensembles have a similar test accuracy of  $99\%$ . Unlike deep ensembles, D-BAT ensembles are able to correctly give high uncertainty values for points far away from the decision boundary. The standard deviations have been omitted here for clarity, but can be seen in App. D.3.

predicted classes on OOD samples. As training set we use the CIFAR-10 classes  $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$ . We use the CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky, 2009) test set as OOD samples to compute the histograms. For D-BAT we use the remaining CIFAR-10 classes,  $\{5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ , as  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$ , and set  $\alpha$  to 0.2. Histograms are averaged over 5 seeds. The three methods considered are simple deep-ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), MC-Dropout models (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), and D-BAT ensembles. For the three methods we use a modified ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) with added dropout to accommodate MC-Dropout, we use a dropout probability of 0.2 for the three methods. For MC-Dropout, we compute uncertainty estimates sampling 20 distributions.

CIFAR-10 results. In Fig. 6, we observe for both deep ensembles and MC-Dropout a large amount of predicted probabilities larger than 0.9, which indicate those methods are overly confident on OOD data. In contrast, most of the predicted probabilities of D-BAT ensembles are smaller than 0.7. The average ensemble accuracies for all those methods are  $92\%$  for deep ensembles,  $91.2\%$  for D-BAT ensembles, and  $90.4\%$  for MC-Dropout.

# 5 LIMITATIONS

Is the simplicity bias gone? While we showed in § 4.1 that our approach can clearly mitigate shortcut learning, a bad choice of  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  distribution can introduce an additional shortcut. In essence, our approach fails to promote diverse representations when differentiating  $\mathcal{D}$  from  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ood}}$  is easier than learning to utilize diverse features. Furthermore, we want to stress that learning complex features is not necessarily unilaterally better than learning simple features, and is not our goal. Complex features are better only so far as they can better explain both the train distribution and OOD data. With our approach, we aim to get a diverse yet simple set of hypotheses. Intuitively, D-BAT tries to find the best hypothesis which may be somewhere within the top-k simplest hypotheses, and not necessarily the simplest one which the simplicity bias is pushing us towards.

# 6 CONCLUSION

Training deep neural networks often results in the models learning to rely on shortcuts present in the training data but absent from the test data. In this work we introduced D-BAT, a novel training method to promote diversity in ensembles of predictors. By encouraging disagreement on OOD data, while agreeing on the training data, we effectively (i) give strong incentives to our predictors to rely on diverse features, (ii) which enhance the transferability of the ensemble and (iii) improve uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. Future directions include improving the selection of samples of the OOD distribution and develop stronger theory. D-BAT could also find applications beyond OOD generalization-e.g. (Tifrea et al., 2021) recently used disagreement for anomaly/novelty detection or to test for biases in our trained models (Stanczak & Augenstein, 2021).
