# ABSTRACT

The objective of lifelong reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize agents which can continuously adapt and interact in changing environments. However, current RL approaches fail drastically when environments are non-stationary and interactions are non-episodic. We propose Lifelong Skill Planning (LiSP), an algorithmic framework for lifelong RL based on planning in an abstract space of higher-order skills. We learn the skills in an unsupervised manner using intrinsic rewards and plan over the learned skills using a learned dynamics model. Moreover, our framework permits skill discovery even from offline data, thereby reducing the need for excessive real-world interactions. We demonstrate empirically that LiSP successfully enables long-horizon planning and learns agents that can avoid catastrophic failures even in challenging non-stationary and non-episodic environments derived from gridworld and MuJoCo benchmarks.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Intelligent agents, such as humans, continuously interact with the real world and make decisions to maximize their utility over the course of their lifetime. This is broadly the goal of lifelong reinforcement learning (RL), which seeks to automatically learn artificial agents that can mimic the continuous learning capabilities of real-world agents. This goal is challenging for current RL algorithms as real-world environments can be non-stationary, requiring the agents to continuously adapt to changing goals and dynamics in robust fashions. In contrast to much of prior work in lifelong RL, our focus is on developing RL algorithms that can operate in non-episodic or "reset-free" settings and learn from both online and offline interactions. This setup approximates real-world learning where we might have plentiful logs of offline data but resets to a fixed start distribution are not viable and our goals and environment change. Performing well in this setting is key for developing autonomous agents that can learn without laborious human supervision in non-stationary, high-stakes scenarios.

However, the performance of standard RL algorithms drops significantly in non-episodic settings. To illustrate this issue, we first pre-train agents to convergence in the episodic Hopper environment (Brockman et al., 2016) with state-of-the-art model-free and model-based RL algorithms: Soft Actor Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018) and Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO) (Janner et al., 2019), respectively. These agents are then trained further in a reset-free setting, representing a real-world scenario where agents seek to improve generalization via continuing to adapt at a test time where resets are more expensive. The learning curves are shown in Figure 1. In spite of a near-perfect initialization, all the agents proceed to fail catastrophically, suggesting that current gradient-based RL methods are inherently unstable in non-episodic settings. This illustrative experiment complements prior work highlighting other failures of RL algorithms in non-stationary and non-

episodic environments: Co-Reyes et al. (2020) find current RL algorithms fail to learn in a simple gridworld environment without resets and Lu et al. (2019) find RL algorithms struggle to learn and adapt to nonstationarity even with access to the ground truth dynamics model. We can attribute these failures to RL algorithms succumbing to sink states. Intuitively, these are states from which

agents struggle to escape, have low rewards, and suggest a catastrophic halting of learning progress (Lyapunov, 1992). For example, an upright walking agent may fall over and fail to return to a standing position, possibly because of underactuated joints. A lifelong agent must seek to avoid such disabling sink states, especially in the absence of resets.

We introduce Lifelong Skill Planning (LiSP), an algorithmic framework for reset-free, lifelong RL that uses long-horizon, decision-time planning in an abstract space of skills to overcome the above challenges. LiSP employs a synergistic combination of model-free policy networks and model-based planning, wherein we use a policy to execute certain skills, planning directly in the skill space. This combination offers two benefits: (1) skills constrain the search space to aid the planner in finding solutions to long-horizon problems and (2) skills mitigate errors in the dynamics model by constraining the distribution of behaviors. We demonstrate that agents learned via LiSP can effectively plan for longer horizons than prior work, enabling better long-term reasoning and adaptation.

Another key component of the LiSP framework is the flexibility to learn skills from both online and offline interactions. For online learning, we extend Dynamics-Aware Discovery of Skills (DADS), a model-based algorithm for unsupervised skills discovery (Sharma et al., 2019), with a skill-practice proposal distribution. We demonstrate that the use of this proposal distribution significantly amplifies the signal for learning skills in reset-free settings. For offline learning from logged interactions, we employ a similar approach as above but with a modification of the reward function to correspond to the extent of disagreement amongst the models in a probabilistic ensemble (Kidambi et al., 2020).

Our key contributions can be summarized as follows:

- We identify skills as a key ingredient for overcoming the challenges to achieve effective lifelong RL in reset-free environments.  
- We propose Lifelong Skill Planning (LiSP), an algorithmic framework for reset-free lifelong RL with two novel components: (a) a skill learning module that can learn from both online and offline interactions, and (b) a long-horizon, skill-space planning algorithm.  
- We propose new challenging benchmarks for reset-free, lifelong RL by extending gridworld and MuJoCo OpenAI Gym benchmarks (Brockman et al., 2016). We demonstrate the effectiveness of LiSP over prior approaches on these benchmarks in a variety of nonstationary, multi-task settings, involving both online and offline interactions.

# 2 BACKGROUND

Problem Setup. We represent the lifelong environment as a sequence of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The lifelong MDP  $\mathcal{M}$  is the concatenation of several MDPs  $(\mathcal{M}_i, T_i)$ , where  $T_i$  denotes the length of time for which the dynamics of  $\mathcal{M}_i$  are activated. Without loss of generality, we assume the sum of the  $T_i$  (i.e., the total environment time) is greater than the agent's lifetime. The properties of the MDP  $\mathcal{M}_i$  are defined by the tuple  $(S, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}_i, r_i, \gamma)$ , where  $\mathcal{S}$  is the state space,  $\mathcal{A}$  is the action space,  $\mathcal{P}_i: S \times \mathcal{A} \times S \to \mathbb{R}$  are the transition dynamics,  $r_i: S \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$  is the reward function, and  $\gamma \in [0,1)$  is the discount factor. Consistent with prior work, we assume  $r_i$  is always known to the agent specifying the task; it is also easy to learn for settings where it is not known. We use  $\mathcal{P}$  and  $r$  as shorthand to refer to the current  $\mathcal{M}_i$  with respect to the agent.

The agent is denoted by a policy  $\pi : S \to \mathcal{A}$  and seeks to maximize its expected return starting from the current state  $s_0$ :  $\arg \max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1} \sim \mathcal{P}, a_t \sim \pi} [\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t)]$ . The policy  $\pi$  may be implemented as a parameterized function or an action-generating procedure. We expect the agent to optimize for the current  $\mathcal{M}_i$ , rather than trying to predict the future dynamics; e.g., a robot may be moved to an arbitrary new MDP and expected to perform well, without anticipating this change in advance.

Skill Discovery. Traditional single-task RL learns a single parametrized policy  $\pi_{\theta}(\cdot |s)$ . For an agent to succeed at multiple tasks, we can increase the flexibility of the agent by introducing a set of latent skills  $z \in [-1,1]^{\dim(z)}$  and learning a skill conditional policy  $\pi_{\theta}(\cdot |s,z)$ . As in standard latent variable modeling, we assume a fixed, simple prior over the skills  $p(z)$ , e.g., uniform. The learning objective of the skill policy is to maximize some intrinsic notion of reward. We denote the intrinsic reward as  $\tilde{r}(s,z,s')$  to distinguish it from the task-specific reward defined previously. For example, one useful reward proposed in DADS (Sharma et al., 2019) can be derived from a variational approximation to the mutual information between the skills and next states  $I(s';z|s)$  as:

Algorithm 1: Lifelong Skill Planning (LiSP)  
Initialize true replay buffer  $\mathcal{D}$  generated replay buffer  $\hat{\mathcal{D}}$  dynamics model ensemble  $\{f_{\phi_i}\}_{i = 0}^{N - 1}$  , policy  $\pi_{\theta}$  discriminator  $q_{\nu}$  , and skill-practice distribution  $p_{\psi}$    
if performing offline pretraining then Learn dynamics model  $f_{\phi}$  and train policy  $\pi_{\theta}$  with UpdatePolicy until convergence while agent is alive at current state s do Update dynamics model to maximize the log probability of transitions of  $\mathcal{D}$  Update policy models with UpdatePolicy  $(\mathcal{D},\hat{\mathcal{D}},f_{\phi},\pi_{\theta},q_{\nu},p_{\psi})$  Execute action from GetAction  $(s,f_{\phi},\pi_{\theta})$  and add environment transition to  $\mathcal{D}$

$$
\tilde {r} (s, z, s ^ {\prime}) = \log \frac {q _ {\nu} \left(s ^ {\prime} \mid s , z\right)}{\frac {1}{L} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {L} q _ {\nu} \left(s ^ {\prime} \mid s , z _ {i}\right)} \quad \text {w h e r e} z _ {i} \sim p (z). \tag {1}
$$

Here  $q_{\nu}(s'|s,z)$  is a tractable variational approximation for the intractable posterior  $p(s'|s,z)$ . Intuitively, this  $\tilde{r}$  learns predictable (via the numerator) and distinguishable (via the denominator) skills.

Model-Based Planning. Whereas RL methods act in the environment according to a parameterized policy, model-based planning methods learn a dynamics model  $f_{\phi}$  to approximate  $\mathcal{P}$  and perform Model Predictive Control (MPC) to generate an action via search over the model (Nagabandi et al., 2017; Chua et al., 2018). At every timestep, MPC selects the policy  $\pi$  that maximizes the predicted  $H$ -horizon expected return from the current state  $s_0$  for a specified reward function  $r$ :

$$
\pi^ {M P C} = \arg \max  _ {\pi} \mathbb {E} _ {a _ {t} \sim \pi , s _ {t + 1} \sim f _ {\phi}} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {H - 1} \gamma^ {t} r \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) \right]. \tag {2}
$$

We use Model Path Predictive Integral (MPPI) (Williams et al., 2015) as our optimizer. MPPI is a gradient-free optimization method that: (1) samples policies according to Gaussian noise on the optimization parameters, (2) estimates the policy returns, and (3) reweighs policies according to a Boltzmann distribution on the predicted returns. For our dynamics model, we use a probabilistic ensemble of  $N$  models  $\{f_{\phi_i}\}_{i = 0}^{N - 1}$ , where each model predicts the mean and variance of the next state. The returns are estimated via trajectory sampling (Chua et al., 2018), where each policy is evaluated on each individual model for the entire  $H$ -length rollout and the returns are averaged.

# 3 LIFELONG SKILL-SPACE PLANNING

In this section, we present Lifelong Skill Planning (LiSP), our proposed approach for reset-free lifelong RL. We provide an outline of LiSP in Algorithm 1. The agent initially learns a dynamics model  $f_{\phi}$  and a skill policy  $\pi_{\theta}$  from any available offline data. Thereafter, the agent continuously updates the model and policy based on online interactions in a reset-free lifelong environment. The agent uses skill-space planning to act in the environment and avoid sink states. We next describe the two key components of our framework in detail: the skill discovery module and skill-space planner.

# 3.1 MODEL-BASED SKILL DISCOVERY

Our goal is to learn a skill-conditioned policy  $\pi_{\theta}$ . In order to minimize interactions with the environment, we first learn a model  $f_{\phi}$  to generate synthetic rollouts for policy training. Since there is no start state distribution, the initialization of these rollouts is an important design choice. We propose to learn a skill-practice distribution  $p_{\psi}(z|s)$  to define which skills to use at a particular stage of training.  $p_{\psi}$  acts as a "teacher" for  $\pi_{\theta}$ , automatically generating a curriculum for skill learning. We include visualizations of the learned skills on 2D gridworld environments in Appendix C.2.

To actually learn the policy, we use the model to generate short rollouts, optimizing  $\pi_{\theta}$  with SAC, similar to model-based policy learning works that find long rollouts make learning unstable due to compounding model errors (Janner et al., 2019). To initialize the rollout, we sample a state from the replay buffer  $\mathcal{D}$  and a skill to practice via  $p_{\psi}$ . We learn  $p_{\psi}$  by learning a model using SAC to

optimize the same intrinsic reward  $\tilde{r}_{\text{adjusted}}$  as  $\pi_{\theta}$ , intuitively only selecting skills which are most useful from the current state instead of arbitrary skills. This is summarized in Algorithm 2.

# 3.1.1 OFFLINE SKILL LEARNING

The key problem in offline RL is avoiding value overestimation, typically by constraining actions to the support of the dataset. We can use our same algorithm to learn skills offline with a simple adjustment to the intrinsic reward based on the model disagreement (Kidambi et al., 2020). For hyperparameters  $\kappa, \alpha_{thres} \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ , we replace the intrinsic reward  $\tilde{r}$  with  $\tilde{r}_{\text{adjusted}}$ , penalizing  $\tilde{r}$  with  $-\kappa$  if the expected model disagreement is greater than  $\alpha_{thres}$ . This penalty encourages the policy to stay within the support of the training set by optimizing against an MDP constructed to underestimate the value function. We approximate the expected  $\ell_2$  disagreement in the mean prediction of the next state, denoted  $\mu_{\phi_i}$  for model  $i$ , between members of the ensemble with a sample. The disagreement estimates the epistemic uncertainty. This is shown in Equation 3.

$$
\tilde {r} _ {\text {a d j u s t e d}} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \tilde {r} & \operatorname {d i s} (s, a) = \mathbb {E} _ {i \neq j} [ \| \mu_ {\phi_ {i}} (s, a) - \mu_ {\phi_ {j}} (s, a) \| _ {2} ^ {2} ] \leq \alpha_ {\text {t h r e s}} \\ - \kappa & \operatorname {d i s} (s, a) > \alpha_ {\text {t h r e s}} \end{array} \right. \tag {3}
$$

# 3.2 PLANNING IN SKILL SPACE FOR RESET-FREE ACTING

As described in Section 1, we argue that the failures of RL in lifelong RL arise chiefly from the naive application of model-free RL. In particular, it is imperative that the model not only be used for sample-efficient policy optimization (as in MBPO), but also that the model be used to safely act in the environment. The method in which acting is performed is important, serving both to exploit what the agent has learned and crucially to maintain the agent's safety in reset-free settings.

In this work, we propose to use model-based planning via MPC. We differ from prior MPC works by planning with the set of skills from Section 3.1, which allow us to utilize the broad capabilities of model-free RL while still enabling the benefits of model-based planning. Planning over skills constrains the MPC optimization to a subset of the action space which the policy is confident in. The model-free policy learns to act in a reliable manner and is consequently more predictable than naive actions. As a result, we are able to perform accurate planning for longer horizons than before (Chua et al., 2018; Nagabandi et al., 2019b). We summarize this subroutine in Algorithm 3.

We summarize the LiSP subroutines in Figure 2. Skills are first learned via Algorithm 2, wherein the skill discriminator generates the intrinsic rewards and the skill-practice distribution generates a skill curriculum. We then plan using the skill policy and the dynamics model as per Algorithm 3.

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATIONS

We wish to investigate the following questions with regards to the design and performance of LiSP:

- Does LiSP learn effectively in lifelong benchmarks with sink states and nonstationarity?  
- What are the advantages of long-horizon skill-space planning over action-space planning?  
- Why is the skill-practice distribution important for learning in this setting?  
- Does LiSP learn a suitable set of skills fully offline for future use?

Lifelong learning benchmarks. We extend several previously studied environments to the lifelong RL setting and distinguish these benchmarks with the prefix Lifelong. The key differences are that these environments have an online non-episodic phase where the agent must learn without resets and (optionally) an offline pretraining starting phase. The agent's replay buffer  $\mathcal{D}$  is initialized with a starting dataset of transitions, allowing the agent to have meaningful behavior from the outset. More details are in Appendix C and we will open source the implementations for wider use. Unless stated otherwise, we run 3 seeds for each experiment and our plots show the mean and standard deviation.

# 4.1 EVALUATION ON LIFELONG BENCHMARKS

We begin by evaluating the overall LiSP framework (Algorithm 1) in non-episodic RL settings, particularly how LiSP interacts with sink states and its performance in nonstationary reset-free settings.

Nonstationary Mujoco locomotion tasks. We evaluate LiSP on Hopper and Ant tasks from Gym (Brockman et al., 2016); we call these Lifelong Hopper and Lifelong Ant. The agents seek to achieve a target x-velocity, which changes over the agent's lifetime. Learning curves are shown in Figure 3. Most agents remain stable despite sink states and adapt to the current tasks.

Minimizing resets with permanent sink states. We evaluate our method in a lifelong 2D volcano gridworld environment where the agent navigates to reach goals while avoiding pitfalls which permanently trap the agent if there is no intervention. Every 200 timesteps, the pitfalls and goals rearrange, which allow the agent to get untrapped; we can consider this as a "reset" if the agent was stuck as it required this intervention to free it. The learning curves are shown in Figure 4. In comparison to not having explicit planning, represented by SAC, LiSP requires significantly fewer resets

(which are almost impossible to fully avoid). We note that LiSP is also stable in the Lifelong Ant environment which likewise has permanent sink states, as the ant cannot recover after falling over.

# 4.2 ADVANTAGES OF LONG HORIZON SKILL-SPACE PLANNING

Next, we seek to clearly show the advantages of planning in the skill space, demonstrating the benefits of using skills in Algorithm 3 and arguing for the use of skills more broadly in lifelong RL.

Constraining model error. We can interpret skill-space planning as constraining the MPC optimization to a more accurate subset of the action space which the policy operates in. In Figure 5, we consider Lifelong Hopper and look at the one-step dynamics model error when evaluated on actions generated by the skill policy vs uniformly from the action space. While most samples from both have similar model error, the variance in the residual error for random actions is high.

![](images/5faa94bbf991248147a9bb20e365622e9c665906abe5566d686b534a04d6230a.jpg)  
Lifelong Hopper 1-Step Prediction Error  
Figure 5:  $\ell_2$  error in the next state prediction of the dynamics model for actions sampled from the skill policy vs. uniformly at random. The error variance is greatly reduced by only using skills.

Constraining planning search space. This advantage in the one-step model error extends to long-horizon planning. In the Lifelong Hopper environment, accurate long-horizon planning is critical in order to correctly execute a hopping motion, which has traditionally made MPC difficult in this environment. For good performance, we use a long horizon of 180 for planning. In Figure 6, we ablate LiSP by planning with actions instead of skills (without gradient updates). Accurate planning with actions is completely infeasible due to the accumulated unconstrained model errors.

Figure 6: Long-horizon planning in Lifelong Hopper with skills instead of actions. Action-space planning is not stable with long horizons. The dashed red line denotes the target velocity.

Model updates are extremely stable. Furthermore, as described in Figure 1, we found that SAC and MBPO fail in reset-free settings when denied access to resets if they continue gradient updates, which we attributed to gradient-based instability. Here we try to understand the stability of RL algorithms; in particular, since we found that policy/critic updates are unstable, we can instead consider how model updates affect planning. To do so, we consider SAC as before, as well as action-space MPC over a short 5-step horizon trying to optimize the same SAC critic (which depends on the policy). These can be viewed as simple ablations of LiSP, as LiSP still uses the dynamics model to predict states from actions, with an additional terminal value function. We note that this is similar to work in Sikchi et al. (2020). The results are shown in Figure 7. If only the model is updated, the algorithm is very stable, showing the resilience of planning to model updates. Alternatively, value function updates make planning unstable, supporting the idea that long-horizon planning improves stability vs relying on a value function. However, even the short 5-step planner avoids the catastrophic failures that occur with no planning, as the additional model stability quickly neutralizes value instability. This also motivates planning with a model using action input, rather than skills as in Sharma et al. (2019), since predictions will remain stable as they do not depend on the policy.

# 4.3 ONLINE SKILL LEARNING WITH A MODEL

Here, we show the importance of the skill-practice distribution from Algorithm 2 for learning setups that require hierarchical skills and involve short model-based rollouts.

![](images/3544b04ed84b97128ef67c6e25051bbdb12a78d36a51be8d849d18a0b3e59a69.jpg)  
Figure 7: Pretrained MPC agent placed in a reset-free setting with continued gradient updates to the model and policy. Unlike the naive SAC agent that acts according to a greedy 1-step planning, the LOOP agent plans vs the same critic over a short 5-step horizon and mostly avoids failure.

Hierarchical skill learning. We consider a 2D Minecraft environment where the agent must learn hierarchical skills to build tools, which in turn are used to create higher level tools. We ablate against minimizing  $\tilde{r}_{\text{adjusted}}$  and a baseline of not using a practice distribution. The learning curves are in Figure 8. Learning skills with directed practice sampling is necessary for learning useful skills. Without the skill-practice curriculum, the asymptotic performance of LiSP is significantly limited.

![](images/d5743f049a1fff9a2542c509d603e8fa296e17043e8899aa6cc64a3499b8d829.jpg)  
Figure 8: 2D Minecraft learning curves with varying skill-practice distributions. Practicing skills that maximize intrinsic reward outperforms naive methods for choosing which skills to practice.

Learning with short rollouts. Algorithm 2 learns skills using one-step rollouts from arbitrary states. These short rollouts significantly reduce learning signal relative to sampling a skill from a fixed start state distribution and running the skill for an entire episode. We investigate this by analyzing DADS-Off (Sharma et al., 2020) – an off-policy improved version of DADS – and resampling skills every  $K$  timesteps. This simulates  $K$ -step rollouts from arbitrary starting states, approximating LiSP except generating data from the real environment. We show the learned skills with various  $K$  for Lifelong Ant in Figure 9. Despite DADS-Off using off-policy data, resampling skills hurts performance severely. When generating transitions with a model as in LiSP, it is unstable to run long model rollouts due to compounding errors, maing the skill-practice distribution critical.

From left to right, skills are resampled during training every 1 timesteps (fully online), 5, 20, and 200 (fully episodic).

# 4.4 LEARNING SKILLS ENTIRELY FROM OFFLINE DATA

Finally, we evaluate the entire LiSP framework (Algorithm 1) in a fully offline setting without test-time updates, considering LiSP as an offline RL algorithm. The most direct baseline to LiSP is action-space MPC (PETS) (Chua et al., 2018), which can learn offline for multiple test-time tasks; we consider PETS as a LiSP ablation that plans without skills. We consider two versions: one that uses a long horizon for planning ( $H = 180$ , PETS-Long) and one with a short horizon ( $H = 25$ , PETS-Short). The former is a direct ablation, while the latter is closer to the original work.

Learning skills offline for multiple tasks. We consider three Lifelong Hopper tasks, where tasks define target velocities. We use the same dataset as Section 4.1, collected from a forward hop task. Our results are in Table 1. While PETS-Long can sometimes perform well, it has high variance; PETS-Short fails. LiSP successfully learns a set of skills offline for all tasks with low variance.

# 5 DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK

In this section, we provide an overview of other works related to LiSP, in similar fields to lifelong RL. We include an in-depth discussion of the related works in Appendix A to highlight the relationship of our work with other subfields of RL.

Non-Episodic RL. The traditional approach to non-episodic RL is to explicitly learn a policy to reset the environment (Eysenbach et al., 2017; Han et al., 2015; Even-Dar et al., 2005). This requires somewhat hard-to-define notions of what a reset should accomplish and still uses manual resets. We do not learn reset policy, instead focusing on naturally safe acting via learning from offline data and effective planning. Zhu et al. (2020) and Co-Reyes et al. (2020) propose solutions to lack of learning signal in reset-free settings but only consider environments without sink states; the latter requires control over the environment to form a training curriculum. Lu et al. (2019) and Lowrey et al. (2018) highlight the benefits of both planning and model-free RL for lifelong agents but require highly accurate world models. Offline RL learns policies exclusively from offline data, which naturally lacks resets (Levine et al., 2020; Agarwal et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Kidambi et al., 2020), but most work is restricted to single-task, stationary settings.

Model-Based Planning. Existing works in model-based planning are restricted to short horizons (Chua et al., 2018; Wang & Ba, 2019; Nagabandi et al., 2019b). Similarly to LiSP, some works (Henaff et al., 2019; Kahn et al., 2017) try to reduce model error for planning by penalizing deviations outside the training set. We found embedding uncertainty into the cost function causes poor cost shaping; these works also still have relatively short horizons. Mishra et al. (2017) learns action priors used to generate actions for MPC that embed past actions in a latent space for constrained planning, similarly to how we skill constraint, but only considers a fairly simple manipulation task. Some works (Lowrey et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019; Sikchi et al., 2020), including in offline RL (Argenson & Dulac-Arnold, 2020), use terminal value functions to aid planning, allowing for successful short-horizon planning; as discussed previously, this does not directly translate to good performance in the lifelong setting due to instability and challenges in learning this function.

Skill Discovery. The key difference from prior skill discovery work is the lack of episodes. The most relevant work to ours is DADS (Sharma et al., 2019). Post-training, the skills learned by DADS can be used for planning with the discriminator  $q_{\nu}$ . Unlike their setup, we plan over the model with action predictions, which allows for accurate planning even if  $q_{\nu}$  is not accurate. Most other works (Hansen et al., 2019; Campos et al., 2020; Warde-Farley et al., 2018; Mohamed & Rezende, 2015; Achiam et al., 2018) are complementary methods that can help learn a better set of skills. Some seek to use skills as pretraining for episodic learning, as opposed to our focus on safe reset-free acting.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We presented LiSP, an algorithm for lifelong learning based on skill discovery and long-horizon skill-space planning. To encourage future work in this space, we proposed new benchmarks that capture the key difficulties of lifelong RL in reset-free, nonstationary settings. Our experiments showed that LiSP effectively learns in non-episodic settings with sink states, vastly improving over prior RL methods, and analyzed ablations to show the benefits of each component.
