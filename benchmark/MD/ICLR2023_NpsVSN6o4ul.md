# ABSTRACT

Research in mechanistic interpretability seeks to explain behaviors of ML models in terms of their internal components. However, most previous work either focuses on simple behaviors in small models, or describes complicated behaviors in larger models with broad strokes. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting an explanation for how GPT-2 small performs a natural language task that requires logical reasoning: indirect object identification (IOI). Our explanation encompasses 28 attention heads grouped into 7 main classes, which we discovered using a combination of interpretability approaches including causal interventions and projections. To our knowledge, this investigation is the largest end-to-end attempt at reverse-engineering a natural behavior "in the wild" in a language model. We evaluate the reliability of our explanation using three quantitative criteria—faithfulness, completeness and minimality. Though these criteria support our explanation, they also point to remaining gaps in our understanding. Our work provides evidence that a mechanistic understanding of large ML models is feasible, opening opportunities to scale our understanding to both larger models and more complex tasks.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Transformer-based language models (Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020) have demonstrated an impressive suite of capabilities, but largely remain black boxes. Understanding these models is difficult because they employ complex non-linear interactions in densely-connected layers and operate in a high-dimensional space. Despite this, they are already deployed in high-impact settings, underscoring the urgency of understanding and anticipating possible model behaviors. Some researchers have even argued that interpretability is necessary for the safe deployment of advanced machine learning systems (Hendrycks & Mazeika, 2022).

Work in mechanistic interpretability aims to discover, understand and verify the algorithms that model weights implement by reverse engineering model computation into human-understandable components (Olah, 2022; Meng et al., 2022; Geiger et al., 2021; Geva et al., 2020). By understanding underlying mechanisms, we can better predict out-of-distribution behavior (Mu & Andreas, 2020), identify and fix model errors (Hernandez et al., 2021; Vig et al., 2020), and understand emergent behavior (Nanda & Lieberum, 2022; Barak et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022).

In this work, we aim to understand how GPT-2 small (Radford et al., 2019) implements a natural language task. To do so, we locate components of the network that produce specific behaviors, and study how they compose to complete the task. Specifically, we discover circuits: induced subgraphs of a model's computational graph that are human-understandable and responsible for a behavior. We employed a number of techniques, most notably activation patching, knockouts, and projections, which we believe are useful, general techniques for circuit discovery.

We focus on understanding a non-trivial, algorithmic natural language task that we call Indirect Object Identification (IOI). In IOI, sentences such as 'When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to' should be completed with 'Mary'. We chose this task because it is linguistically meaningful and admits a complex but interpretable algorithm: of the two names in the sentence, predict the name that isn't the subject of the last clause.

Figure 1: Left: We isolated a circuit (in orange) responsible for the flow of information connecting the indirect object 'Mary' to the next token prediction. The nodes are attention blocks and the edges represent the interactions between attention heads. Right: We discovered and validated this circuit using activation experiments, including both patches and knockouts of attention heads.

We discover a circuit of 28 attention heads-  $1.5\%$  of the total number of (head, token position) pairs that completes this task. The circuit uses 7 different categories of heads (see Figure 2) to implement the algorithm. Together, these heads route information between different name tokens, to the end position, and finally to the output. Our work provides, to the best of our knowledge, the most detailed attempt at reverse-engineering a natural end-to-end behavior in a transformer-based language model.

Explanations for model behavior can easily be misleading or non-rigorous (Jain & Wallace, 2019; Bolukbasi et al., 2021). To remedy this problem, we formulate three criteria to help validate our circuit explanations. These criteria are faithfulness (the circuit can perform the task as well as the whole model), completeness (the circuit contains all the nodes used to perform the task), and minimality (the circuit doesn't contain nodes irrelevant to the task). Our circuit shows significant improvements compared to a naive (but faithful) circuit, but fails to pass the most challenging tests.

In summary, our main contributions are: (1) We identify a large circuit in GPT-2 small that performs indirect-object identification (Figure 2 and Section 3); (2) Through example, we identify useful techniques for understanding models, as well as surprising pitfalls; (3) We present criteria that ensure structural correspondence between the circuit and the model, and check experimentally whether our circuit meets this standard (Section 4).

# 2 BACKGROUND

In this section, we introduce the IOI task, review the transformer architecture, define circuits more formally and describe a technique for "knocking out" nodes in a model.

Task description. In indirect object identification (IOI), two names (the indirect object (IO) and the first occurrence of the subject (S1)) are introduced in an initial dependent clause (see Figure 1). A main clause then introduces the second occurrence of the subject (S2), who is usually exchanging an item. The task is to complete the main clause, which always ends with the token 'to', with the non-repeated name (IO). We create many dataset samples for IOI  $(\mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}})$  using 15 templates (see Appendix A) with random single-token names, places and items.

To quantify GPT-2 small's performance on the IOI task, we use two different metrics: logit difference and IO probability. Logit difference measures the difference in logit value between the two names, where a positive score means the correct name (IO) has higher probability. IO probability measures the absolute probability of the IO token under the model's predictions. Both metrics are averaged over  $\mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}}$ . GPT-2 small has mean logit difference of 3.55, averaged across over 100,000 dataset examples, and mean IO probability of  $49\%$ .

Transformer architecture. GPT-2 small is a decoder-only transformer with 12 layers and 12 attention heads per attention layer. In this work, we mostly focus on understanding the mechanisms of attention heads, which we describe using notation similar to Elhage et al. (2021). We leave a full description of the model to Appendix C.

The input to the transformer is the sum of position and token embeddings,  $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ , where  $N$  is the number of tokens in the input and  $d$  is the model dimension. This input embedding is the initial value of the residual stream, which all attention layers and MLPs read from and write to. Attention layer  $i$  of the network takes as input  $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ , the value of the residual stream before it. The attention layer output can be decomposed into the sum of attention heads  $h_{i,j}$ . If the output of the attention layer is  $y_i = \sum_j h_{i,j}(x_i)$ , then the residual stream is updated to  $x_i + y_i$ .

Focusing on individual heads, each head  $h_{i,j}$  is parametrized by four matrices  $W_{Q}^{i,j}$ ,  $W_{K}^{i,j}$ ,  $W_{V}^{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times \frac{d}{H}}$  and  $W_{O}^{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{\frac{d}{H} \times d}$ . We rewrite these parameters as low-rank matrices in  $\mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ :  $W_{OV}^{i,j} = W_{O}^{i,j}W_{V}^{i,j}$  and  $W_{QK}^{i,j} = (W_{Q}^{i,j})^{T}W_{K}^{i,j}$ . The QK matrix is used to compute the attention pattern  $A_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$  of head  $(i,j)$ , while the OV matrix determines what is written into the residual stream. At the end of the forward pass, a layer norm is applied before the unembed matrix  $W_{U}$  projects the residual stream into logits.

# 2.1 CIRCUITS

In mechanistic interpretability, we want to reverse-engineer models into interpretable algorithms. A useful abstraction for this goal are circuits. If we think of a model as a computational graph  $M$  where nodes are terms in its forward pass (neurons, attention heads, embeddings, etc.) and edges are the interactions between those terms (residual connections, attention, projections, etc.), a circuit  $C$  is a subgraph of  $M$  responsible for some behavior (such as completing the IOI task). This definition of a circuit is slightly different from that in Olah et al. (2020), where nodes are features (meaningful directions in the latent space of a model) instead of model components.

# 2.2 KNOCKOUTS

Just as the entire model  $M$  defines a function  $M(x)$  from inputs to logits, we also associate each circuit with a function  $C(x)$ , via knockouts. A knockout removes a set of nodes  $K$  in a computational graph  $M$  with the goal of "turning off" nodes in  $K$  but capturing all other computations in  $M$ . Thus,  $C(x)$  is defined by knocking out all nodes in  $M \backslash C$  and taking the resulting logit outputs in the modified computational graph.

A first naive knockout approach consists of simply deleting each node in  $K$  from  $M$ . The net effect of this removal is to zero ablate  $K$ , meaning that we turn its output to 0. This naive approach has an important limitation: 0 is an arbitrary value, and subsequent nodes might rely on the average activation value as an implicit bias term. Because of this, we find zero ablation to lead to noisy results in practice.

To address this, we instead knockout nodes through mean ablation: replacing them with their average activation value across some reference distribution (similar to the bias correction method used in Nanda & Lieberum (2022)). Mean-ablations will remove the influence of components sensitive to the variation in the reference distribution (i.e. attention heads that move names in  $\mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}}$ ), but will not influence components using information constant in the distribution (i.e. attention patterns that are constant in  $\mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}}$ ). Through mean-ablations, we are interested in finding the components that move information about names, which is the core of the IOI task and also varies with the distribution.

In this work, all knockouts are performed in a modified  $\mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}}$  distribution with three random names, so the sentences no longer have a single plausible IO. We mean-ablate on this distribution, which we call the 'ABC' distribution, because mean-ablating on the  $\mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}}$  distribution would not remove enough information, like information constant in  $\mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}}$  that is helpful for the task. To knockout a single node, a (head, token position) pair in our circuit, we compute the mean of that node across samples of the same template. Computing means across the entire distribution instead of templates would average activations at different tokens, like names, verbs and conjunctions, mixing information destructively.

Figure 2: We discover a circuit in GPT-2 small that implements IOI. The input tokens on the left are passed into the residual stream. Attention heads move information between residual streams: the query and output arrows show which residual streams they write to, and the key/value arrows show which residual streams they read from.

# 3 DISCOVERING THE CIRCUIT

We seek to explain how GPT-2 small implements the IOI task (Section 2). Recall the example sentence "When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to". The following human-interpretable algorithm suffices to perform this task:

1. Identify all previous names in the sentence (Mary, John, John).  
2. Remove all names that are duplicates (in the example above: John).  
3. Output the remaining name.

Our circuit contains three major classes of heads, corresponding to these three components:

- Duplicate Token Heads identify tokens that have already appeared in the sentence. They are active at the S2 token, attend primarily to the S1 token and write a 'signal' into the residual stream that token duplication has occurred.  
- S-Inhibition Heads perform step 2 of the human-interpretable algorithm. They are active at the END token, attend to the S2 token and write to bias the query of the Name Mover Heads against both S1 and S2 tokens.  
- Name Mover Heads, by default, attend to previous names in the sentence, but due to the S-Inhibition Heads attend less to the S1 and S2 tokens. Their OV matrix is a name copying matrix, so in  $p_{IOI}$ , they increase the logit of the IO token.

A fourth major family of heads writes in the opposite direction of the Name Mover Heads, thus decreasing the confidence of the predictions. We speculate that these Negative Name Mover Heads might help the model "hedge" so as to avoid high cross-entropy loss when making mistakes.

There are also three minor classes of heads that perform related functions to the components above:

- Previous Token Heads copy the embedding of S to position  $\mathrm{S} + 1$ .  
- Induction Heads perform the same role as the Duplicate Token Heads through an induction mechanism. They are active at position S2, attend to token S+1 (mediated by the Previous Token Heads), and output a signal that the S token previously appeared in the context.  
- Finally, Backup Name Mover Heads do not normally move the IO token to the output, but take on this role if the regular Name Mover Heads are knocked out.

Note that our circuit does not include the MLPs. We are interested in the flow of information across tokens, and MLPs only process features along tokens. Moreover, initial investigations suggest all MLPs except for the first one are not crucial for this task (Appendix G), though more precise investigation is left for future work.

Below, we show step-by-step how we discovered each component, providing evidence that they behave as described above. We found that it was most natural to uncover the circuit starting at the logits and working back. Thus we start with the Name Mover and Negative Name Mover Heads.

# 3.1 WHICH HEADS DIRECTLY WRITE TO THE OUTPUT? (NAME MOVER HEADS)

We begin by identifying which attention heads directly affect the model's output: in other words, the heads writing in the residual stream at the END position, in a direction that has high dot product with the logit difference. Formally, let  $W_{U}$  denote the unembedding matrix,  $\overline{\mathrm{LN}}$  a layer norm operation (see Appendix F) and  $W_{U}[IO]$ ,  $W_{U}[S]$  the corresponding unembedding vectors for the  $IO$  and  $S$  tokens. We searched for heads  $(i,j)$  such that

$$
\lambda_ {i, j} \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {X \sim \mathrm {p} _ {\mathrm {I O I}}} [ \langle \overline {{\mathrm {L N}}} \circ h _ {i, j} (X), W _ {U} [ I O ] - W _ {U} [ S ] \rangle ] \tag {1}
$$

had large magnitude. Recall that  $h_{i,j}(X)$  is the value that head  $(i,j)$  writes into the residual stream on input  $X$ . Therefore, heads with  $\lambda_{i,j} > 0$  correctly promote the IO token over the S token (on average). The unembedding projection in (1) is called the logit lens and has been used in previous work to interpret intermediate activations (nostalgebraist, 2020) and parameters (Dar et al., 2022). We display the values of  $\lambda_{i,j}$  in Figure 3 A. We see that only a few heads in the final layers have large logit projection  $\lambda_{i,j}$ . Specifically, 9.6, 9.9, and 10.0 have a large positive score, while 10.7 and 11.10 have a large negative score.

Name Mover Heads. To understand the positive heads, we first study their attention patterns. We find that they attend strongly to the IO token: the average attention probability of all heads over  $\mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}}$  is 0.59. Since attention patterns can be misleading (Jain & Wallace, 2019), we check whether attention is correlated with the heads' functionality. We do so by scatter plotting the attention probability against the logit score  $\langle h_i(X), W_U[IO]\rangle$ . The results are shown in Figure 3 B: higher attention probability on the IO token is linearly correlated with higher output in the IO direction (correlation  $\rho > 0.81$ ,  $N = 500$ ). Based on this result, we hypothesize that these heads (i) attend to names and (ii) copy whatever they attend to. We therefore call these heads Name Mover Heads.

To check that the Name Mover Heads copy names generally, we studied what values are written via the heads' OV circuits. We transform the output of the first layer at a name token through the OV matrix of a Name Mover Head and then project to the logits. The copy score is the proportion of samples that contain the input name token in the top 5 logits ( $N = 1000$ ). We find that all three Name Mover Heads have a copy score above  $95\%$  (compared to less than  $20\%$  for an average head).

Negative Name Mover Heads. In Figure 3, we also observed two heads strongly writing opposite the  $W_{U}[IO] - W_{U}[S]$  direction. We called these heads Negative Name Mover Heads. Their copy score is calculated with the negative of their OV matrix. As described in Figure 3, they share all the properties of Name Mover Heads, except they write in the opposite of names they attend to.

Figure 4: The attention probability to IO averaged over three Name Mover Heads is decreased most by the Previous Token Heads (left), Induction Heads (center) and S-Inhibition Heads (right) when we patch these attention heads from a sentence with a different S2 name (center and right), or a different S1 name (left).

# 3.2 WHICH HEADS AFFECT THE NAME MOVER HEADS' ATTENTION? (S-INHIBITION HEADS)

Given that the Name Mover Heads are primarily responsible for constructing the output, we ask why these Name Mover Heads pay preferential attention to the IO token. First, there are two ways to affect the Name Mover Heads's attention: through the query vector at the END token or the key vector at the IO token. Since the key vector appears early in the context, it likely does not contain much task-specific information, so we focus on the END query vector.

Then, by investigating Name Mover Heads on the ABC distribution (where the three names are distinct; see Section 2.2), we observed that their attention is not selective: they pay equal attention to the first two names. We thus ask: what has changed from the ABC distribution to the  $p_{\mathrm{IOI}}$  distribution to cause the Name Mover Heads to attend to the IO token preferentially?

To empirically answer this question, we perform a patching experiment. As illustrated in Figure 1 this technique consists of two steps. First we save all activations of the network run on a source sequence. Then we run the network on a target sequence, replacing some activations with the activations from the source sequence. We can then measure the behavior of the patched model. Doing this for each node individually locates the nodes that explain why model behavior is different in the source and target sequences.

In our case, we run activation patching with source sentences from the ABC distribution and target sentences from  $\mathsf{p_{IOI}}$ . We then compute the change in attention probability from END to IO, averaged over the three Name Mover Heads. Since the Name Mover Heads attention on the IO is high in the  $\mathsf{p_{IOI}}$  distribution and low in ABC, patching at important heads from ABC to  $\mathsf{p_{IOI}}$  should decrease. Name Mover Heads attention on IO. The results from patching every head at the END token position are shown in Figure 4, right. We observe that patching heads 7.3, 7.9, 8.6, 8.10 causes a decrease in the attention probability on IO, indicating that they are counterfactually important for the Name Mover Heads's attention probability on the IO token. We call these heads S-Inhibition Heads, because in  $\mathsf{p_{IOI}}$  they primarily cause the Name Mover Head attention to drop on the S tokens (thus increasing the attention on the IO token).

# 3.3 WHAT INFORMATION DO THE S-INHIBITION HEADS MOVE?

How do the S-Inhibition Heads differentiate between IO and S, so they inhibit one but not the other? We measured their attention pattern and found that they preferentially attend to the S2 token. We therefore studied what information these heads move from the S2 token position to the END position.

Towards this end, we ran a patching experiment at S2 from the ABC distribution to the IOI distribution and measured the variation in Name Mover Heads attention. The results (Figure 4, center) reveal a large set of heads influencing Name Mover Heads' attention that did not appear at the END position. Logically, S-Inhibition Heads mediate this effect, as they are the only heads influencing Name Mover Heads at the END position. This reasoning suggests that the outputs of this set of head

is moved by S-Inhibition Heads from S2 to the END token. When we analyze the attention patterns of these heads, we see two distinct groups emerge.

Duplicate Token Heads. One group attends from S2 to S1. We call these Duplicate Token Heads on the hypothesis that they detect duplicate tokens. To validate this, we analyze their attention pattern on sequences of random tokens (with no semantic meaning), we found that 2 of the 3 Duplicate Token Heads pay strong attention to a previous occurrence of the current token if it exists (see Appendix D for more details). How do the duplicate token heads affect the S2 attention patterns? There is strong evidence that Duplicate Token Heads write a 'copying signal' into the residual stream that S2 Inhibition heads are able to attend to, that doesn't encode information about the tokens that are copied. Appendix E explores the correlational and causal case for this behavior.

Induction Heads and Previous Token Heads. The other group of heads attends from S2 to S1+1 (the token after the S1 token): the classic attention pattern of an induction head. Previously described in Elhage et al. (2021), induction heads recognize the general pattern [A] [B] ... [A] and contribute to predicting [B] as the next token. For this, they act in pair with a Previous Token Head. The Previous Token Head should write information about [A] into the residual stream at [B], so that the Induction Head can match the next occurrence of [A] to that position (and subsequently copy [B] to the output).

We therefore seek to identify Previous Token Heads used by our purported Induction Heads. To this end, we patched activations from a sentence where S1 is replaced by a random name, at the  $\mathrm{S} + 1$  token index. As shown in figure 4, some heads (and particularly 4.11) appear to influence Name Mover Heads. Then, by looking at the attention pattern of the heads with the most important influence in this patching experiment, we identified 3 Previous Token Heads. After analyzing attention patterns on random token sequences, we found that 2 of the 3 Previous Token Heads and 2 of the 4 Induction Heads demonstrated the expected behavior in this out-of-distribution case (Appendix D).

In our task, the Induction Heads writing into the S2 residual stream is an additional way for S-Inhibition Heads to detect that S occurs earlier in the context, on top of the Duplicate Token Heads' role. These Induction Heads, like Duplicate Token Heads, appear to be writing a copying signal into the residual stream at S2 (Appendix E), making them somewhat unlike traditional induction heads that simply copy the token [B].

# 3.4 DID WE MISS ANYTHING? THE STORY OF THE BACKUP NAME MOVERS HEADS

Each type of head in our circuit has many copies, suggesting that the model implements redundant behavior. To make sure that we didn't miss any copies, we knocked out all of the Name Mover Heads at once. To our surprise, the circuit still worked (only  $10\%$  drop in logit difference). In addition, many heads write along  $W_{U}[IO] - W_{U}[S]$  after the knockout, which did not do so previously.

We kept the height heads with the strongest  $\lambda_{i,j}$ , and call them Backup Name Mover Heads. See appendix B for further details on these heads. Among the height heads identified, we investigated their behavior before the knockout. We observe diverse behavior: 3 heads show close resemblance to Name Mover Heads; 3 heads equally attend to IO and S and copy them; 1 head pays more attention to S1 and copies it; 1 head seems to track and copy subjects of clauses, copying S2 in this case.

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION

In this section, we check that our circuit provides a good account of GPT-2's true behavior. In general, our criteria depend on a measure  $F$  of the performance of a circuit on a task. In our case, suppose  $X \sim \mathfrak{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}}$ , and  $f(C(X);X)$  is the logit difference between the IO and S tokens when the circuit  $C$  is run on the input  $X$ . The average logit difference  $F(C) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \mathbb{E}_{X \sim \mathfrak{p}_{\mathrm{IOI}}} [f(C(X);X)]$  is a measure of how much a circuit predicts IO rather than S, i.e performs the IOI task.

Firstly, we check that  $C$  is faithful to  $M$ , i.e. that it computes similar outputs. We do so by measuring  $|F(M) - F(C)|$ , and find that it is small: 0.2, or only  $6\%$  of  $F(M) = 3.55$ .

In Section 4.1 we define a running toy example of a model  $M$  for which faithfulness is not sufficient to prescribe which circuits explain a behavior defined by a measure  $F$  well. This motivates the criteria of completeness and minimality that we then check on our circuit.

![](images/2c9596ed759571c0fe121a29946a490776fa82a1d3415ca129c0a120ad896f1a.jpg)  
Figure 5: Plot of points  $(x_{K},y_{K}) = (\mathrm{F}(M\setminus K),\mathrm{F}(C\setminus K))$  for our circuit (left) and a naive circuit (right). Each point is for a different choice of  $K$ : 50 uniformly randomly chosen  $K\subseteq C$ ,  $K = \emptyset$ , and the five  $K$  with the highest completeness score found by greedy optimization. Since the completeness score is  $|x_{K} - y_{K}|$ , we show the line  $y = x$  for reference.

# 4.1 COMPLETENESS

As a running example, suppose a model  $M$  uses two similar and disjoint serial circuits  $C_1$  and  $C_2$ . The two sub-circuits are run in parallel before applying an OR operation to their results. Identifying only one of the circuits is enough to achieve faithfulness, but we want explanations that include both  $C_1$  and  $C_2$ , since these are both used in the model's computation.

To solve this problem, we introduce the completeness criterion: for every subset  $K \subseteq C$ ,  $|F(C \setminus K) - F(M \setminus K)|$  should be small. In other words,  $C$  and  $M$  should not just be similar, but remain similar under knockouts.

In our running example, we can show that  $C_1$  is not complete by setting  $K = C_1$ . Then  $C_1 \setminus K$  is the empty circuit while  $M \setminus K$  still contains  $C_2$ . The metric  $|F(C_1 \setminus K) - F(M \setminus K)|$  will be large because  $C_1 \setminus K$  has trivial performance while  $M \setminus K$  successfully performs the task.

The criterion of completeness requires a search over exponentially many subsets  $K \subseteq C$ . This is computationally intractable given the size of our circuit, hence we use three sampling methods to find examples of  $K$  that give large completeness score:

- The first sampling method chooses subsets  $K \subseteq C$  uniformly at random.  
- The second sampling method set  $K$  to be an entire class of circuit heads  $G$ , e.g. the Name Mover Heads.  $C \setminus G$  should have low performance since it's missing a key component, whereas  $M \setminus G$  might still do well if it has redundant components that fill in for  $G$ .  
- Thirdly, we greedily optimized  $K$  node-by-node to maximize the completeness score (see appendix I for the detail of the optimization procedure).

These first two methods of sampling  $K$  suggested to us that our circuit was  $\varepsilon$ -complete for a small value of  $\varepsilon$ . However, the third resulted in sets  $K$  that had high completeness score: up to 3.09. All such results are found in figure 5, on the left.

# 4.2 MINIMALITY

A faithful and complete circuit may contain unnecessary components, and so be overly complex. To avoid this, we should check that each of its nodes  $v$  is actually necessary. This can be evaluated by showing that  $v$  can significantly recover  $F$  after knocking out a set of nodes  $K$ .

Formally, the minimality criterion is whether for every node  $v \in C$  there exists a subset  $K \subseteq C \setminus \{v\}$  that has minimality score  $|F(C \setminus (K \cup \{v\})) - F(C \setminus K)| \geq A$ . We call a circuit  $A$ -minimal if this holds.

In the running example,  $C_1 \cup C_2$  is  $A$ -minimal for some non-trivial  $A$ . We can sketch a proof of this result given an informal definition of 'non-trivial'. To show this, note that if  $v_1 \in C_1$  and  $K = C_2$ , then the minimality score is equal to  $|F(C_1 \setminus \{v_1\}) - F(C_1)|$  which is large since  $C_1$  is a serial circuit and so removing  $v_1$  will destroy the behavior. We then proceed symmetrically for  $v_2 \in C_2$ .

What happens in practice for our circuit? We need to exhibit for every  $v$  a set  $K$  such that the minimality score is at least  $A$ . For most heads, removing the class of heads  $G$  that  $v$  is a part of provides a reasonable minimality score. We describe the sets  $K$  that are required for them in Appendix H. The importance of individual nodes is highly variable, but they all have a significant impact on the final metric (at least 3% of the original logit difference). These results ensure that we did not interpret irrelevant nodes, but do show that the individual contribution of some single attention heads is small.

Figure 6: Plot of minimality scores  $|F(C \setminus (K \cup \{v\})) - F(C \setminus K)|$  for all components  $v$  in our circuit. The sets  $K$  used for each component, as well as the initial and final values of the logit difference for each of these  $v$  is in Appendix H. Our circuit is 0.06-minimal.

# 4.3 COMPARISON WITH A NAIVE CIRCUIT

In the previous sections, we reviewed our circuit on the three quantitative criteria. But without a relative comparison, these numbers are not particularly useful. In order to get a relative sense of the success of our explanation by our criteria, we compare the results on a naive circuit that consists of the Name Mover Heads (but no Backup Name Mover Heads), S-Inhibition Heads, two Induction Heads, two Duplicate Token Heads and two Previous Token Heads. This circuit has a faithfulness score 0.1, a score comparable to our circuit's faithfulness score. However, contrary to our circuit, the naive circuit can be easily proven incomplete: by sampling random sets or by knocking-out by classes, we see that  $F(M \setminus K)$  is much higher than  $F(C \setminus K)$  (Figure 5, left). Nonetheless, when we applied the greedy heuristic to optimize for the completeness score, both circuits have similarly large completeness scores. Thus, we conclude that our worst-case completeness criteria was too high a bar, which future work could use as a high standard to validate circuit discovery.

# 5 DISCUSSION

A major motivation for this work was to gain evidence that mechanistic explanations for large language models is possible. Does this approach scale? In initial analyses with GPT-2 medium, we find that GPT-2 medium also has a sparse set of heads writing in the  $W_{U}[IO] - W_{U}[S]$  direction. However, not all of these heads attend to IO and S, suggesting more complex behavior than the Name Movers Heads in GPT-2 small. Furthering this investigation is an exciting line of future work.

After completing this work, we learned several lessons useful for future interpretability efforts. We found that specifying a behavior and representative distribution for this behavior is a fundamental difficulty. For this reason, we think algorithmic tasks, as opposed to heuristics, are easier to interpret because they impose a clearer structure on model internals. In the circuit discovery process, we found activation patching useful for the discovery of important nodes. Activation patching is particularly useful with algorithmic tasks that have input schemas (Appendix A) because they suggest relevant source distributions for patching.

In this work, we discover, understand and check a circuit in GPT-2 small that identifies indirect objects. However, there are still several components we still do not understand, including the attention patterns of the S-Inhibition Heads, and the effect of MLPs and layer norms. We hope that our work spurs further efforts in mechanistic explanations of larger language models computing different natural language tasks, with the eventual goal of understanding full language model capabilities.
