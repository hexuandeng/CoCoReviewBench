# ABSTRACT

Emphatic temporal difference (ETD) learning (Sutton et al., 2016) is a successful method to conduct the off-policy value function evaluation with function approximation. Although ETD has been shown to converge asymptotically to a desirable value function, it is well-known that ETD often encounters a large variance so that its sample complexity can increase exponentially fast with the number of iterations. In this work, we propose a new ETD method, called PER-ETD (i.e., PERiodically Restarted-ETD), which restarts and updates the follow-on trace only for a finite period for each iteration of the evaluation parameter. Further, PER-ETD features a design of the logarithmical increase of the restart period with the number of iterations, which guarantees the best trade-off between the variance and bias and keeps both vanishing sublinearly. We show that PER-ETD converges to the same desirable fixed point as ETD, but improves the exponential sample complexity of ETD to be polynomials. Our experiments validate the superior performance of PER-ETD and its advantage over ETD.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

As a major value function evaluation method, temporal difference (TD) learning (Sutton, 1988; Dayan, 1992) has been widely used in various planning problems in reinforcement learning. Although TD learning performs successfully in the on-policy settings, where an agent can interact with environments under the target policy, it can perform poorly or even diverge under the off-policy settings when the agent only has access to data sampled by a behavior policy (Baird, 1995; Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997; Mahmood et al., 2015). To address such an issue, the gradient temporal-difference (GTD) (Sutton et al., 2008) and least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) (Yu, 2010) algorithms have been proposed, which have been shown to converge in the off-policy settings. However, since GTD and LSTD consider an objective function based on the behavior policy, their converging points can be largely biased from the true value function due to the distribution mismatch between the target and behavior policies, even when the express power of the function approximation class is arbitrarily large (Kolter, 2011).

In order to provide a more accurate evaluation, Sutton et al. (2016) proposed the emphatic temporal difference (ETD) algorithm, which introduces the follow-on trace to address the distribution mismatch issue. The stability of ETD was then shown in Sutton et al. (2016); Mahmood et al. (2015), and the asymptotic convergence guarantee for ETD was established in Yu (2015), it has also achieved great success in many tasks (Ghiassian et al., 2016; Ni, 2021). However, although ETD can address the distribution mismatch issue to yield a more accurate evaluation, it often suffers from very large variance error due to the follow-on trace estimation over a long or infinite time horizon (Hallak et al., 2016). Consequently, the convergence of ETD can be very slow and unstable in practice. It can be shown that the variance of ETD can grow exponentially fast as the number of iterations grows so that ETD requires exponentially large number of samples to converge. Hallak et al. (2016) proposed an ETD method to keep the follow-on trace bounded but at the cost of a possibly large bias error. This thus poses the following intriguing question:

Can we design a new ETD method, which overcomes its large variance without introducing a large bias error, and improves its exponential sample complexity to be polynomial at the same time?

In this work, we provide an affirmative answer.

# 1.1 MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS

We propose a novel ETD approach, called PER-ETD (i.e., PPeriodically Restarted-ETD), in which for each update of the value function parameter we restart the follow-on trace iteration and update it only for  $b$  times (where we call  $b$  as the period length). Such a periodic restart effectively reduces the variance of the follow-on trace. More importantly, with the design of the period length  $b$  to increase logarithmically with the number of iterations, PER-ETD attains the polynomial rather than exponential sample complexity required by ETD.

We provide the theoretical guarantee of the sample efficiency of PER-ETD via the finite-time analysis. We show that PER-ETD (both PER-ETD(0) and PER-ETD( $\lambda$ ) converges to the same fixed points of ETD(0) and ETD( $\lambda$ ), respectively, but with only polynomial sample complexity (whereas ETD takes exponential sample complexity). Our analysis features the following key insights. (a) The period length  $b$  plays the role of trading off between the variance (of the follow-on trace) and bias error (with respect to the fixed point of ETD), and its optimal choice of logarithmical increase with the number of iterations achieves the best tradeoff and keeps both errors vanishing sublinearly. (b) Our analysis captures how the mismatch between the behavior and target policies affects the convergence rate of PER-ETD. Interestingly, the mismatch level determines a phase-transition phenomenon of PER-ETD: as long as the mismatch is below a certain threshold, then PER-ETD achieves the same convergence rate as the on-policy TD algorithm; and if the mismatch is above the threshold, the converge rate of PER-ETD gradually decays as the level of mismatch increases.

Experimentally, we demonstrate that PER-ETD converges in the case that neither TD nor ETD converges. Further, our experiments provide the following two interesting observations. (a) There does exist a choice of the period length for PER-ETD, which attains the best tradeoff between the variance and bias errors. Below such a choice, the bias error is large so that evaluation is not accurate, and above it the variance error is large so that the convergence is unstable. (b) Under a small period length  $b$ , it is not always the case that PER-ETD(λ) with  $\lambda = 1$  attains the smallest error with respect to the ground truth value function. The best  $\lambda$  depends on the geometry of the locations of fixed points of PER-ETD(λ) for  $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$ , which is determined by chosen features.

# 1.2 RELATED WORKS

TD learning and GTD: The asymptotic convergence of TD learning was established by Sutton (1988); Jaakkola et al. (1994); Dayan & Sejnowski (1994); Tsitsiklis & Van Roy (1997), and its non-asymptotic convergence rate was further characterized recently in Dalal et al. (2018a); Bhandari et al. (2018); Kotsalis et al. (2020). The gradient temporal-difference (GTD) was proposed in Sutton et al. (2008) for off-policy evaluation and was shown to converge asymptotically. Then, Lakshminarayanan & Szepesvari (2018); Dalal et al. (2018b); Gupta et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2018); Xu et al. (2019); Xu & Liang (2021) provided the finite-time analysis of GTD and its variants.

Emphatic Temporal Difference (ETD) Learning: The ETD approach was originally proposed in the seminal work Sutton et al. (2016), which introduced the follow-on trace to overcome the distribution mismatch between the behavior and target policies. Yu (2015) provided the asymptotic convergence guarantee for ETD. Hallak et al. (2016) showed that the variance of the follow-on trace may be unbounded. They further proposed an ETD method with a variable decay rate to keep the follow-on trace bounded but at the cost of a possibly large bias error. Our approach is different and keeps both the variance and bias vanishing sublinearly with the number of iterations. Imani et al. (2018) developed a new policy gradient theorem, where the emphatic weight is used to correct the distribution shift. Zhang et al. (2020b) provided a new variant of ETD, where the emphatic weights are estimated through function approximation. Van Hasselt et al. (2018); Jiang et al. (2021) studied ETD with deep neural function class.

Comparison to concurrent work: During our preparation of this paper, a concurrent work (Zhang & Whiteson, 2021) was posted on arXiv, and proposed a truncated ETD (which we refer to as T-ETD for short here), which truncates the update of the follow-on trace to reduce the variance of ETD. While T-ETD and our PER-ETD share a similar design idea, there are several critical differences between our work from Zhang & Whiteson (2021). (a) Our PER-ETD features a design of the logarithmical increase of the restart period with the number of iterations, which guarantees the convergence to the original fixed point of ETD, with both the variance and bias errors vanishing sublinearly. However, T-ETD is guaranteed to converge only to a truncation-length-dependent fixed

point, where the convergence is obtained by treating the truncation length as a constant. A careful review of the convergence proof indicates that the variance term scales exponentially fast with the truncation length, and hence the polynomial efficiency is not guaranteed as the truncation length becomes large. (b) Our convergence rate for PER-ETD does not depend on the cardinality of the state and has only polynomial dependence on the mismatch parameter of the behavior and target policies. However, the convergence rate in Zhang & Whiteson (2021) scales with the cardinality of the state, and increases exponentially fast with the mismatch parameter of behavior and target policies. (c) This paper further studies PER-ETD(λ) and the impact of λ on the converge rate and variance and bias errors, whereas Zhang & Whiteson (2021) considers further the application of T-ETD to the control problem.

# 2 BACKGROUND AND PRELIMINARIES

# 2.1 MARKOV DECISION PROCESS

We consider the infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) defined by the five tuple  $(S, \mathcal{A}, r, \mathsf{P}, \gamma)$ . Here,  $S$  and  $\mathcal{A}$  denote the state and action spaces respectively, which are both assumed to be finite sets,  $r: S \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$  denotes the reward function,  $\mathsf{P}: S \times \mathcal{A} \to \Delta(S)$  denotes the transition kernel, where  $\Delta(S)$  denotes the probability simplex over the state space  $S$ , and  $\gamma \in (0, 1)$  is the discount factor.

A policy  $\pi : S \to \Delta(\mathcal{A})$  of an agent maps from the state space to the probability simplex over the action space  $\mathcal{A}$ , i.e.,  $\pi(a|s)$  represents the probability of taking the action  $a$  under the state  $s$ . At any time  $t$ , given that the system is at the state  $s_t$ , the agent takes an action  $a_t$  with the probability  $\pi(a_t|s_t)$ , and receives a reward  $r(s_t, a_t)$ . The system then takes a transition to the next state  $s_{t+1}$  at time  $t+1$  with the probability  $\mathsf{P}(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$ .

For a given policy  $\pi$ , we define the value function corresponding to an initial state  $s_0 = s \in S$  as  $V_{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t) | s_0 = s, \pi\right]$ . Then the value function over the state space can be expressed as a vector  $V_{\pi} = (V_{\pi}(1), V_{\pi}(2), \ldots, V_{\pi}(|S|))^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{S}|}$ .

When the state space is large, we approximate the value function  $V_{\pi}$  via a linear function class as  $V_{\theta}(s) = \phi^{\top}(s)\theta$ , where  $\phi(s) \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$  denotes the feature vector, and  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$  denotes the parameter vector to be learned. We further let  $\Phi = [\phi(1), \phi(2), \ldots, \phi(|S|)]^{\top}$  denote the feature matrix, and then  $V_{\theta} = \Phi\theta$ . We assume that the feature matrix  $\Phi$  has linearly independent columns and each feature vector has bounded  $\ell_{2}$ -norm, i.e.,  $\| \phi(s) \|_{2} \leq B_{\phi}$  for all  $s \in S$ .

# 2.2 TEMPORAL DIFFERENCE (TD) LEARNING FOR ON-POLICY EVALUATION

In order to evaluate the value function for a given target policy  $\pi$  (i.e., find the linear function approximation parameter  $\theta$ ), the temporal difference (TD) learning can be employed based on a sampling trajectory, which takes the following update rule at each time  $t$ :

$$
\theta_ {t + 1} = \theta_ {t} + \eta_ {t} \left(r \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) + \gamma \theta_ {t} ^ {\top} \phi \left(s _ {t + 1}\right) - \theta_ {t} ^ {\top} \phi \left(s _ {t}\right)\right) \phi \left(s _ {t}\right), \tag {1}
$$

where  $\eta_{t}$  is the stepsize at time  $t$ . The main idea here is to follow the Bellman operation update to approach its fixed point, and the above sampled version update can be viewed as the so-called semigroup descent update. If the trajectory is sampled by the target policy  $\pi$ , then the above TD algorithm can be shown to converge to the fixed point solution, where the convergence is guaranteed by the negative definiteness of the so-called key matrix  $A \coloneqq \lim_{t \to \infty} \mathbb{E}\left[(\gamma \phi(s_t + 1) - \phi(s_t)) \phi^\top(s_t)\right]$ .

# 2.3 EMPHATIC TD (ETD) LEARNING FOR OFF-POLICY EVALUATION

Consider the off-policy setting, where the goal is still to evaluate the value function for a given target policy  $\pi$ , but the agent has access only to trajectories sampled under a behavior policy  $\mu$ . Namely, at each time  $t$ , the probability of taking an action  $a_{t}$  given  $s_{t}$  is  $\mu(a_{t}|s_{t})$ . Let  $d_{\mu}$  denote the stationary distribution of the Markov chain induced by the behavior policy  $\mu$ , i.e.,  $d_{\mu}$  satisfies  $d_{\mu}^{\top} = d_{\mu}^{\top}P_{\pi}$ . We assume that  $d_{\mu}(s) > 0$  for all states. The mismatch between the target and behavior policies can be addressed by incorporating the importance sampling factor  $\rho(s,a) \coloneqq \frac{\pi(a|s)}{\mu(a|s)}$  into eq. (1) to adjust

the TD learning update direction. However, with such modification, the key matrix  $A$  may not be negative definite so that the algorithm is no longer guaranteed to converge.

In order to address this divergence issue, the emphatic temporal difference (ETD) algorithm has been proposed by Sutton et al. (2016), which takes the following update

$$
\theta_ {t + 1} = \theta_ {t} + \eta_ {t} \rho \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) F _ {t} \left(r \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) + \gamma \theta_ {t} ^ {\top} \phi \left(s _ {t + 1}\right) - \theta_ {t} ^ {\top} \phi \left(s _ {t}\right)\right) \phi \left(s _ {t}\right). \tag {2}
$$

In eq. (2), in addition to the importance sampling factor  $\rho$ , a follow-on trace coefficient  $F_{t}$  is introduced as a calibration factor, which is updated as

$$
F _ {t} = \gamma \rho \left(s _ {t - 1}, a _ {t - 1}\right) F _ {t - 1} + 1, \tag {3}
$$

with initialization  $F_0 = 1$ . With such a follow-on trace factor, the key matrix becomes negative definite, and ETD has been shown to converge asymptotically in Yu (2015) to the fixed point

$$
\theta^ {*} = \left(\Phi^ {\top} F (I - \gamma P _ {\pi}) \Phi\right) ^ {- 1} \Phi^ {\top} F r _ {\pi}, \tag {4}
$$

where  $F = \mathrm{diag}(f(1), f(2), \ldots, f(|S|))$  and  $f(i) = d_{\mu}(i) \lim_{t \to \infty} \mathbb{E}\left[F_t | s_t = i\right]$ .

Similarly, the  $\mathrm{ETD}(\lambda)$  algorithm can be further derived, which has the following update

$$
\theta_ {t + 1} = \theta_ {t} + \eta_ {t} \rho (s _ {t}, a _ {t}) \left(r (s _ {t}, a _ {t}) + \gamma \theta_ {t} ^ {\top} \phi (s _ {t + 1}) - \theta_ {t} ^ {\top} \phi (s _ {t})\right) e _ {t},
$$

where  $e_t$  is updated as  $e_t = \gamma \lambda \rho (s_{t - 1},a_{t - 1})e_{t - 1} + M_t\phi (s_t)$  and  $M_{t} = \lambda +(1 - \lambda)F_{t}$ , where  $M_0 = 1$  and  $e_0 = \phi (s_0)$ . It has been shown that with a diminishing stepsize (Yu, 2015), ETD( $\lambda$ ) converges to the fixed point given by

$$
\theta_ {\lambda} ^ {*} = \left(\Phi^ {\top} M (I - \gamma \lambda P _ {\pi}) ^ {- 1} (I - \gamma P _ {\pi}) \Phi \theta\right) ^ {- 1} \Phi^ {\top} M (I - \gamma \lambda P _ {\pi}) ^ {- 1} r _ {\pi},
$$

where  $M = \mathrm{diag}(m(1), m(2), \ldots, m(|S|))$  and  $m(i) = d_{\mu}(i) \lim_{t \to \infty} \mathbb{E}\left[M_t | s_t = i\right]$ .

# 2.4 NOTATIONS

For the simplicity of expression, we adopt the following shorthand notations. For a fixed integer  $b$ , let  $s_t^\tau \coloneqq s_{t(b+1)+\tau}$ ,  $a_t^\tau \coloneqq a_{t(b+1)+\tau}$ ,  $\rho_t^\tau = \frac{\pi(a_t^\tau|s_t^\tau)}{\mu(a_t^\tau|s_t^\tau)}$  and  $\phi_t^\tau = \phi(s_t^\tau)$ . We also define the filtration  $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \ldots, s_{t(b+1)+b}, a_{t(b+1)+b}, s_{t(b+1)+b+1})$ . Further, let  $r_\pi \in \mathbb{R}^{|S|}$ , where  $r_\pi(s) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} r(s, a)\pi(a|s)$ . Let  $P_\pi \in \mathbb{R}^{|S| \times |S|}$ , where  $P_\pi(s'|s) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi(a|s)\mathsf{P}(s'|s, a)$ . For a matrix  $M \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ ,  $M_{(s,\cdot)}$  denotes its  $s$ -th row and  $M_{(\cdot,s)}$  denotes its  $s$ -th column.

# 3 PROPOSED PER-ETD ALGORITHMS

Drawbacks of ETD: In the original design of ETD (Sutton et al., 2016) described in Section 2.3, the follow-on trace coefficient  $F_{t}$  is updated throughout the execution of the algorithm. As a result, its variance can increase exponentially with the number of iterations, which causes the algorithm to be unstable and diverge, as observed in Hallak et al. (2016) (also see our experiment in Section 5).

# Algorithm 1 PER-ETD(0)

1: Input: Parameters  $T$ ,  $b$ , and  $\eta_t$ .  
2: Initialize:  $\theta_0 = 0$  
3: for  $t = 0,1,\dots,T$  do  
4:  $F$  update:  $F_{t}^{\tau +1} = \gamma \rho_{t}^{\tau}F_{t}^{\tau} + 1$ , where  $\tau = 0,1,\ldots ,b - 1$  and  $F_{t}^{0} = 1$  
5:  $\theta$  update:  $\theta_{t + 1} = \Pi_{\Theta}\left(\theta_t + \eta_tF_t^b\rho_t^b (r_t^b +\gamma \theta_t^\top \phi_t^{b + 1} - \theta_t^\top \phi_t^b)\phi_t^b\right)$  
6: end for

In order to overcome the divergence issue of ETD, we propose to PEriodically Restart the follow-on trace update for ETD, which we call as the PER-ETD algorithm (see Algorithm 1). At iteration  $t$ , PER-ETD reinitiates the follow-on trace  $F$  and update it for  $b$  iterations to obtain an estimate  $F_{t}^{b}$  where we call  $b$  as the period length. The emphatic update operator at  $t$  is then given by

$$
\widehat {\mathcal {T}} _ {t} (\theta) = F _ {t} ^ {b} \rho_ {t} ^ {b} \phi_ {t} ^ {b} \left(\phi_ {t} ^ {b} - \gamma \phi_ {t} ^ {b + 1}\right) ^ {\top} \theta - F _ {t} ^ {b} \rho_ {t} ^ {b} \phi_ {t} ^ {b} r _ {t} ^ {b}, \tag {5}
$$

and PER-ETD updates the value function parameter  $\theta_{t}$  as  $\theta_{t + 1} = \Pi_{\Theta}\left(\theta_t - \eta_t\widehat{T}_t(\theta_t)\right)$ , where the projection onto an bounded closed convex set  $\Theta$  helps to stabilize the algorithm. It can be shown that  $\lim_{b\to \infty}\mathbb{E}[\widehat{T}_t(\theta)|\mathcal{F}_{t - 1}] = \mathcal{T}(\theta)$  where  $\mathcal{T}(\theta)\coloneqq \bigl (\Phi^{\top}F(I - \gamma P_{\pi})\Phi \bigr)\theta -\Phi^{\top}Fr_{\pi}$ . The fixed point of the operator  $\mathcal{T}(\theta)$  is  $\theta^{*}$  defined in eq. (4), which is exactly the fixed point of original ETD.

Definition 1 (Optimal point and  $\epsilon$ -accurate convergence). We call the unique fixed point  $\theta^{*}$  of  $\mathcal{T}(\theta)$  as the optimal point (which is the same as the fixed point of ETD). The algorithm attains an  $\epsilon$ -accurate optimal point if its output  $\theta_{T}$  satisfies  $\| \theta_T - \theta^*\| _2^2\leq \epsilon$

The goal of PER-ETD is to find the original optimal point  $\theta^{*}$  of ETD, which is independent from the period length  $b$ . Our analysis will provide a guidance to choose the period length  $b$  in order for PER-ETD to keep both the variance and bias errors below the target  $\epsilon$ -accuracy with polynomial sample efficiency.

Algorithm 2 PER-ETD(λ)  
1: Input: Parameters  $T$ ,  $b$ , and  $\eta_t$ .  
2: Initialize:  $\theta_0 = 0$ .  
3: for  $t = 0, 1, \ldots, T$  do  
4: Set  $F_t^0 = M_t^0 = 1$  and  $e_t^0 = \phi_t^0$   
5: for  $\tau = 1, \ldots, b$  do  
6:  $F_t^\tau = \rho_t^{\tau - 1} \gamma F_t^{\tau - 1} + 1$ ,  $M_t^\tau = \lambda + (1 - \lambda) F_t^\tau$ ,  $e_t^\tau = \gamma \lambda \rho_t^{\tau - 1} e_t^{\tau - 1} + M_t^\tau \phi_t^\tau$   
7: end for  
8:  $\theta$  update:  $\theta_{t+1} = \Pi_\Theta (\theta_t + \eta_t \rho_t^b (r_t^b + \gamma \theta_t^\top \phi_t^{b+1} - \theta_t^\top \phi_t^b) e_t^b)$   
9: end for

We then extend PER-ETD(0) to PER-ETD( $\lambda$ ) (see Algorithm 2), which incorporates the eligible trace. Specifically, at each iteration  $t$ , PER-ETD( $\lambda$ ) reinitiates the follow-on trace  $F_{t}$  and updates it together with  $M_{t}$  and the eligible trace  $e_{t}$  for  $b$  iterations to obtain an estimate  $e_{t}^{b}$ . Then the emphatic update operator at  $t$  is given by

$$
\widehat {\mathcal {T}} _ {t} ^ {\lambda} (\theta) = \rho_ {t} ^ {b} e _ {t} ^ {b} \left(\phi_ {t} ^ {b} - \gamma \phi_ {t} ^ {b + 1}\right) ^ {\top} \theta - \rho_ {t} ^ {b} r _ {t} ^ {b} e _ {t} ^ {b}, \tag {6}
$$

and the value function parameter  $\theta_{t}$  is updated as  $\theta_{t + 1} = \Pi_{\Theta}\left(\theta_{t} - \eta_{t}\widehat{\mathcal{T}}_{t}^{\lambda}(\theta_{t})\right)$ . It can be shown that  $\lim_{b\to \infty}\mathbb{E}\left[\widehat{\mathcal{T}}_t^\lambda (\theta)\big|\mathcal{F}_{t - 1}\right] = \mathcal{T}^\lambda (\theta)$ , where

$$
\mathcal {T} ^ {\lambda} (\theta) = \Phi^ {\top} M (I - \gamma \lambda P _ {\pi}) ^ {- 1} (I - \gamma P _ {\pi}) \Phi \theta - \Phi^ {\top} M (I - \gamma \lambda P _ {\pi}) ^ {- 1} r _ {\pi},
$$

which takes a unique fixed point  $\theta_{\lambda}^{*}$  as the original  $\mathrm{ETD}(\lambda)$ . The optimal point and the  $\epsilon$ -accurate convergence can be defined in the same fashion as in Definition 1. It has been shown in Hallak et al. (2016) that  $\theta_{\lambda}^{*}$  is exactly the orthogonal projection of  $V_{\pi}$  to the function space when  $\lambda = 1$ , and thus is the optimal approximation to the value function.

# 4 FINITE-TIME ANALYSIS OF PER-ETD ALGORITHMS

# 4.1 TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS

We take the following standard assumptions for analyzing the TD-type algorithms in the literature (Jiang et al., 2021; Zhang & Whiteson, 2021; Yu, 2015).

Assumption 1 (Coverage of behavior policy). For all  $s \in S$  and  $a \in \mathcal{A}$ , the behavior policy  $\mu$  satisfies  $\mu(a|s) > 0$  as long as  $\pi(a|s) > 0$ .

Assumption 2. The Markov chain induced by the behavior policy  $\mu$  is irreducible and recurrent.

The following lemma on the geometric ergodicity has been established.

Lemma 1 (Geometric ergodicity). (Levin & Peres, 2017, Thm. 4.9) Suppose Assumption 2 holds. Then the Markov chain induced by the behavior policy  $\mu$  has a unique stationary distribution  $d_{\mu}$  over the state space  $\mathcal{S}$ . Moreover, the Markov chain is uniformly geometric ergodic, i.e., there exist constants  $C_M \geq 0$  and  $0 < \chi < 1$  such that for every initial state  $s_0 \in \mathcal{S}$ , the state distribution  $d_{\mu,t}(s) = \mathbb{P}(s_t = s | s_0)$  after  $t$  transitions satisfies  $\| d_{\mu,t} - d_{\mu} \|_1 \leq C_M \chi^t$ .

# 4.2 FINITE-TIME ANALYSIS OF PER-ETD(0)

In PER-ETD(0), the update of the value function parameter is fully determined by the empirical emphatic operator  $\widehat{\mathcal{T}}_t(\theta)$  defined in eq. (5). Thus, we first characterize the bias and variance errors of  $\widehat{\mathcal{T}}_t(\theta)$ , which serve the central role in establishing the convergence rate for PER-ETD(0).

Proposition 1 (Bias bound). Suppose Assumptions  $\checkmark 1$  and 2 hold. Then we have

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| \mathcal {T} (\theta_ {t}) - \mathbb {E} \left[ \widehat {\mathcal {T}} _ {t} (\theta_ {t}) \mid \mathcal {F} _ {t - 1} \right] \right\| _ {2} \right] \leq C _ {b} \left(B _ {\phi} \| \theta_ {t} - \theta^ {*} \| _ {2} + \epsilon_ {a p p r o x}\right) \xi^ {b},
$$

where  $\epsilon_{\text{approx}} = \|\Phi\theta^{*} - V_{\pi}\|_{\infty}$  is the function approximation error of the fixed point,  $C_b > 0$  is a constant, and  $\xi = \max \{\gamma, \chi\} < 1$ .

Proposition 1 characterizes the conditional expectation of the bias error of the empirical emphatic operator  $\widehat{\widetilde{T}_t} (\theta)$ . Since  $\xi = \max \{\gamma ,\chi \} < 1$ , such a bias error decays exponentially fast as  $b$  increases.

Proposition 2 (Variance bound). Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Then we have

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \left| \left| \widehat {\mathcal {T}} _ {t} (\theta_ {t}) \right| \right| _ {2} ^ {2} \mid \mathcal {F} _ {t - 1} \right] \leq \sigma^ {2}, \quad w h e r e \quad \sigma^ {2} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \mathcal {O} (1), & i f \quad \gamma^ {2} \rho_ {\max } <   1, \\ \mathcal {O} (b), & i f \quad \gamma^ {2} \rho_ {\max } = 1, \\ \mathcal {O} \left(\left(\gamma^ {2} \rho_ {\max }\right) ^ {b}\right), & i f \quad \gamma^ {2} \rho_ {\max } > 1, \end{array} \right. \tag {7}
$$

where  $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$  is with respect to the scaling of  $b$ .

Proposition 2 captures the variance bound of the empirical emphatic operator. It can be seen that if the distribution mismatch is large (i.e.,  $\gamma^2\rho_{max} > 1$ ), the variance bound grows exponentially large as  $b$  increases, which is consistent with the finding in Hallak et al. (2016). However, as we show below, as long as  $b$  is controlled to grow only logarithmically with the number of iterations, such a variance error will decay sublinearly with the number of iterations. At the same time, the bias error can also be controlled to decay sublinearly, so that the overall convergence of PER-ETD can be guaranteed with polynomial sample complexity efficiency.

Theorem 1. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Consider PER-ETD(0) specified in Algorithm 1. Let the step-size  $\eta_t = \frac{2}{\mu_0(t + t_0)}$ , where  $\mu_0$  and  $L_0$  are defined in Lemmas 7 and 8 in Appendix B,  $t_0 = \frac{8L_0^2}{\mu_0^2}$ , and  $b \geq \left\lceil \frac{\log(\mu_0) - \log(5C_bB_\phi)}{\log(\xi)} \right\rceil$ . Let the projected set  $\Theta = \{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d : \| \theta \|_2 \leq B_\theta\}$  with  $\theta^* \in \Theta$ . Then the output  $\theta_T$  of PER-ETD(0) falls into the following two cases.

(a) If  $\gamma^2\rho_{max}\leq 1$  , then  $\mathbb{E}\left[\| \theta_T - \theta^*\| _2^2\right]\leq \tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$  
(b) If  $\gamma^2\rho_{max} > 1$ , then  $\mathbb{E}\left[\| \theta_T - \theta^*\| _2^2\right]\leq \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^a}\right)$ , where  $a = \frac{1}{\log_{1 / \xi}(\gamma^2\rho_{max}) + 1} < 1$ .

Thus, PER-ETD(0) attains an  $\epsilon$ -accurate solution with  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$  samples if  $\gamma^2\rho_{max} \leq 1$ , and with  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/a}}\right)$  samples if  $\gamma^2\rho_{max} > 1$ .

Theorem 1 captures how the convergence rate depends on the mismatch between the behavior and target policies via the parameter  $\rho_{max}$  (where  $\rho_{max} \geq 1$ ). (a) If  $\gamma^2 \rho_{max} \leq 1$ , i.e., the mismatch is less than a threshold, then PER-ETD(0) converges at the rate of  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ , which is the same as that of on-policy TD learning (Bhandari et al., 2018). This result indicates that even under a mild mismatch  $1 < \rho_{max} \leq 1 / \gamma^2$ , PER-ETD achieves the same convergence rate as on-policy TD learning. (b) If  $\gamma^2 \rho_{max} \geq 1$ , i.e., the mismatch is above the threshold, then PER-ETD(0) converges at a slower rate of  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^a}\right)$  because  $a < 1$ . Further, as the mismatch parameter  $\rho_{max}$  gets larger, the converge becomes slower, because  $a$  becomes smaller.

Bias and variance tradeoff: Theorem 1 also indicates that although PER-ETD(0) updates the follow-on trace only over a finite period length  $b$ , it still converges to the optimal fixed point  $\theta^{*}$ . This benefits from the proper choice of the period length, which achieves the best bias and variance tradeoff as we explain as follows. The proof of Theorem 1 shows that the output  $\theta_{T}$  of PER-ETD(0) satisfies the following convergence rate:

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \| \theta_ {T} - \theta^ {*} \| _ {2} ^ {2} \right] \leq \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {\| \theta_ {0} - \theta^ {*} \| _ {2} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}\right) + \underbrace {\mathcal {O} \left(\frac {\sigma^ {2}}{T}\right)} _ {\text {v a r i a n c e}} + \underbrace {\mathcal {O} \left(\frac {\xi^ {2 b}}{T}\right) + \mathcal {O} \left(\xi^ {b}\right)} _ {\text {b i a s}}. \tag {8}
$$

If  $\gamma^2\rho_{max}\leq 1$ , then  $\sigma^2$  in the variance term in eq. (8) satisfies  $\sigma^2\leq \mathcal{O}(b)$  as given in eq. (7), which increases at most linearly fast with  $b$ . Then we set  $b = \max \left\{\left\lceil \frac{\log(\mu_0) - \log(5C_bB_\phi)}{\log(\xi)}\right\rceil ,\frac{\log T}{\log(1 / \xi)}\right\}$  so that both the variance and the bias terms in eq. (8) achieve the same order of  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ , which dominates the overall convergence.

If  $\gamma^2\rho_{max} > 1$ , then  $\sigma^2$  in the variance term in eq. (8) satisfies  $\sigma^2 = \mathcal{O}\left((\gamma^2\rho_{max})^b\right)$  as given in eq. (7). Now, we need to set  $b$  as  $b = \max \left\{\left\lceil \frac{\log(\mu_0) - \log(5C_bB_\phi)}{\log(\xi)}\right\rceil ,\frac{\log(T)}{\log(\gamma^2\rho_{max}) + \log(1 / \xi)}\right\}$ , where the increase with  $\log T$  has a smaller coefficient than the previous case, so that both the variance and the bias terms in eq. (8) achieve the same order of  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^a}\right)$ . Such a choice of  $b$  balances the exponentially increasing variance and exponentially decaying bias to achieve the same rate.

# 4.3 FINITE-TIME ANALYSIS OF PER-ETD(λ)

In PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$ , the update of the value function parameter is determined by the empirical emphatic operator  $\hat{\mathcal{T}}_t^\lambda (\theta)$  defined in eq. (6). Thus, we first obtain the bias and variance errors of  $\hat{\mathcal{T}}_t^\lambda (\theta)$ , which facilitate the analysis of the convergence rate for PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$ .

Proposition 3. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Then we have

$$
\left\| \mathbb {E} \left[ \widehat {\mathcal {T}} _ {t} ^ {\lambda} (\theta_ {t}) \mid \mathcal {F} _ {t - 1} \right] - \mathcal {T} ^ {\lambda} (\theta_ {t}) \right\| _ {2} \leq C _ {b, \lambda} \left(B _ {\phi} \| \theta_ {t} - \theta_ {\lambda} ^ {*} \| _ {2} + \epsilon_ {a p p r o x}\right) \xi^ {b},
$$

where  $\epsilon_{\text{approx}} = \|\Phi \theta_{\lambda}^{*} - V_{\pi}\|_{\infty}$  is the function approximation error,  $C_{b,\lambda}$  is a constant given a fixed  $\lambda$ , and  $\xi = \max \{\chi, \gamma\} < 1$ .

The above proposition shows that the bias error of the empirical emphatic operator  $\widehat{T}_t^\lambda (\theta)$  in PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  decays exponentially fast as  $b$  increases, because  $\xi = \max \{\gamma ,\chi \} < 1$

Proposition 4. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Then we have

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| \widehat {\mathcal {T}} _ {t} ^ {\lambda} \left(\theta_ {t}\right) \right\| _ {2} ^ {2} \mid \mathcal {F} _ {t - 1} \right] \leq \sigma_ {\lambda} ^ {2}, \quad \text {w h e r e} \quad \sigma_ {\lambda} ^ {2} = \mathcal {O} \left(\rho_ {\max } ^ {b}\right). \tag {9}
$$

Compared with Proposition 2 of ETD(0), Proposition 4 indicates that  $\mathrm{ETD}(\lambda)$  has a larger variance, which always increases exponentially with  $b$  when  $\rho_{max} > 1$ . This is due to the fact that the eligible trace  $e_t^b$  carries the historical information and is less stable than  $\phi_t^b$ .

Theorem 2. Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Consider PER-ETD(λ) specified in Algorithm 2. Let the step-size  $\eta_t = \frac{2}{\mu_\lambda(t + t_\lambda)}$ ,  $t_\lambda = \frac{8L_\lambda^2}{\mu_\lambda^2}$ , where  $\mu_\lambda$  and  $L_\lambda$  are defined in Lemmas 7 and 8 in Appendix B, and let  $b \geq \left\lceil \frac{\log(\mu_\lambda) - \log(5C_{b,\lambda}B_\phi)}{\log(\xi)} \right\rceil$ . Let the projected set  $\Theta = \{ \theta \in \mathbb{R}^d : \| \theta \|_2 \leq B_\theta \}$  with  $\theta_\lambda^* \in \Theta$ . Then the output  $\theta_T$  of PER-ETD(λ) satisfies

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \| \theta_ {T} - \theta_ {\lambda} ^ {*} \| _ {2} ^ {2} \right] \leq \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {1}{T ^ {a _ {\lambda}}}\right),
$$

where  $a_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\log_{1 / \xi}(\rho_{max}) + 1}$ . PER-ETD(λ) attains an  $\epsilon$ -accurate solution with  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{1 / a_{\lambda}}}\right)$  samples.

Theorem 2 indicates that PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  converges to the optimal fixed point  $\theta_{\lambda}^{*}$  determined by the infinite-length update of the follow-on trace. Furthermore, PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  converges at the rate of  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{a_{\lambda}}}\right)$  which is slower than PER-ETD(0) (as  $a_{\lambda} < a$ ) due to the larger variance of PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$ .

Bias and variance tradeoff: We next explain how the period length  $b$  achieves the best tradeoff between the bias and variance errors and thus yields polynomial sample efficiency. The proof of Theorem 2 shows that the output  $\theta_T$  of PER-ETD(λ) satisfies the following convergence rate:

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \| \theta_ {T} - \theta_ {\lambda} ^ {*} \| _ {2} ^ {2} \right] \leq \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {\| \theta_ {0} - \theta_ {\lambda} ^ {*} \| _ {2} ^ {2}}{T ^ {2}}\right) + \underbrace {\mathcal {O} \left(\frac {\sigma_ {\lambda} ^ {2}}{T}\right)} _ {\text {v a r i a n c e}} + \underbrace {\mathcal {O} \left(\frac {\xi^ {2 b}}{T}\right) + \mathcal {O} (\xi^ {b})} _ {\text {b i a s}}. \tag {10}
$$

In eq. (10),  $\sigma_{\lambda}^{2}$  in the variance term takes the form  $\sigma_{\lambda}^{2} = \mathcal{O}\left(\rho_{max}^{b}\right)$  as given in eq. (9). We need to set  $b = \left\{\left\lceil \frac{\log(\mu_0) - \log(5C_bB_\phi)}{\log(\xi)}\right\rceil, \frac{\log(T)}{\log(\rho_{max}) + \log(1 / \xi)}\right\}$  so that both the variance and the bias terms in

eq. (10) achieve the same order of  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^a x}\right)$ . Thus, such a choice of  $b$  balances the exponentially increasing variance and exponentially decaying bias to achieve the same rate.

Impact of  $\lambda$  on error bound: It has been shown that with the aid of eligible trace, both TD learning and ETD learning achieve smaller error bounds (Sutton & Barto, 2018; Hallak et al., 2016). However, this is not always the case for PER-ETD. Since PER-ETD applies a finite period length  $b$ , the fixed point of PER-ETD(1) is generally not the same as the projection of the ground truth to the function approximation space. Thus, as  $\lambda$  changes from 0 to 1, depending on the geometrical locations of the fixed points of PER-ETD( $\lambda$ ) for all  $\lambda$  (determined by chosen features) with respect to the ground truth projection, any value  $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$  may achieve the smallest bias error. We illustrate this further by experiments in Section 5.2.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

# 5.1 PERFORMANCE OF PER-ETD(0)

We consider the BAIRD counter-example. The details of the MDP setting and behavior and target policies could be found in Appendix A.1. We adopt a constant learning rate for both PER-ETD(0) and PER-ETD( $\lambda$ ) and all experiments take an average over 20 random initializations. We set the stepsize  $\eta = 2^{-9}$  for all algorithms for fair comparison. For PER-ETD(0), we adopt one-dimensional features  $\Phi_1 = (0.35, 0.35, 0.35, 0.35, 0.35, 0.35, 0.35, 0.37)$ . The ground truth value function  $V_{\pi} = (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10)$  and does not lie inside the linear function class.

(b) Tradeoff between bias and variance by  $b$

In Figure 1(a), we compare the performance of TD, vanilla ETD(0) and PER-ETD(0) with  $b = 2, 4, 8$  in terms of the distance between the ground truth and the learned value functions. It can be observed that our proposed PER-ETD(0) converges close to the ground truth at a properly chosen period length such as  $b = 4$  and  $b = 8$ , whereas TD diverges due to no treatment on off-policy data historically, and ETD (0) also diverges due to the very large variance.

In Figure 1(b), we plot how the bias and the variance of PER-ETD(0) change as the period length  $b$  changes. Clearly, small  $b$  (e.g.,  $b = 4$ ) yields a small variance but a large bias. Then as  $b$  increases from 4 to 6, bias is substantially reduced. As  $b$  continues to increase from 8 to 20, there is a significant increase in variance. This demonstrates a clear tradeoff between the bias and variance as we capture in our theory.

# 5.2 PERFORMANCE OF PER-ETD(λ)

We next focus on PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  under the same experiment setting as in Section 5.1 and study how  $\lambda$  affects the performance. We conduct our experiments under three features  $\Phi_1, \Phi_2,$  and  $\Phi_3$  specified in Appendix A.2. Figure 2 shows how the bias error with respect to the ground truth changes as  $\lambda$  increases under the three chosen features. As shown in Figure 2 (a), (b), and (c),  $\lambda = 0, 1,$  and some value between 0 and 1 respectively achieve the smallest error under the corresponding feature. This is in contrast to the general understanding that  $\lambda = 1$  typically achieves the smallest error.

(c) Feature  $\Phi_3$

In fact, each case can be explained by the plot in Figure 3 under the same feature. Each plot in Figure 3 illustrates how the fixed points of PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  are located with respect to the ground truth projection (as  $V_{\pi}$  projection) for  $b = 4$ . Since the period length  $b$  is finite, the fixed point of PER-ETD(1) is not located at the same point as the ground truth projection. The geometric locations of the fixed points of PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  for  $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$  are determined by chosen features. The bias error corresponds to the distance between the fixed point of PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  and the  $V_{\pi}$  projection. Then under each feature, the value of  $\lambda$  that attains the smallest error with respect to the  $V_{\pi}$  projection can be readily seen from the plot in Figure 3. For example, under the feature  $\Phi_3$ , Figure 3 (c) suggests that neither  $\lambda = 0$  nor  $\lambda = 1$ , but some  $\lambda$  between 0 and 1 achieves the smallest error. This explains the result in Figure 2 (c) that  $\lambda = 0.4$  achieves the smallest error among other curves.

As a summary, our experiment suggests that the best  $\lambda$ , under which PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  attains the smallest error, depends on the geometry of the problem determined by chosen features. In practice, if PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  is used as a critic in policy optimization problems,  $\lambda$  may be tuned via the final reward achieved by the algorithm.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we proposed a novel PER-ETD algorithm, which uses a periodic restart technique to control the variance of follow-on trace update. Our analysis shows that by selecting the period length properly, both bias and variance of PER-ETD vanishes sublinearly with the number of iterations, leading to the polynomial sample efficiency to the desired unique fixed point of ETD, whereas ETD requires exponential sample complexity. Our experiments verified the advantage of PER-ETD against both TD and ETD. Moreover, our experiments of PER-ETD  $(\lambda)$  illustrated that under the finite period length in practice, the best  $\lambda$  that achieves the smallest bias error is feature dependent. We anticipate that PER-ETD can be applied to various off-policy optimal control algorithms such as actor-critic algorithms and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.
