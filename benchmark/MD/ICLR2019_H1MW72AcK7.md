# ABSTRACT

Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design. Deep neural networks have proven to be successful in many identification tasks, however, from model-based control perspective, these networks are difficult to work with because they are typically nonlinear and nonconvex. Therefore many systems are still identified and controlled based on simple linear models despite their poor representation capability. In this paper we bridge the gap between model accuracy and control tractability faced by neural networks, by explicitly constructing networks that are convex with respect to their inputs. We show that these input convex networks can be trained to obtain accurate models of complex physical systems. In particular, we design input convex recurrent neural networks to capture temporal behavior of dynamical systems. Then optimal controllers can be achieved via solving a convex model predictive control problem. Experiment results demonstrate the good potential of the proposed input convex neural network based approach in a variety of control applications. In particular we show that in the MuJoCo locomotion tasks, we could achieve over  $10\%$  higher performance using  $5\times$  less time compared with state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning method; and in the building HVAC control example, our method achieved up to  $20\%$  energy reduction compared with classic linear models.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Decisions on how to best operate and control complex physical systems such as the power grid, commercial and industrial buildings, transportation networks and robotic systems are of critical societal importance. These systems are often challenging to control because they tend to have complicated and poorly understood dynamics, sometimes with legacy components are built over a long period of time Wolf (2009). Therefore detailed models for these systems may not be available or may be intractable to construct. For instance, since buildings account for  $40\%$  of the global energy consumption Cheng et al. (2008), many approaches have been proposed to operate buildings more efficiently by controlling their heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems Zhang et al. (2017). Most of these methods, however, suffer from two drawbacks. On one hand, a detailed physics model of a building can be used to accurately describe its behavior, but this model can take years to develop. On the other hand, simple control algorithms has been developed by using linear (RC circuit) models Ma et al. (2012) to represent buildings, but the performance of these models may be poor since the building dynamics can be far from linear Shaikh et al. (2014).

In this paper, we leverage the availability of data to strike a balance between requiring painstaking manual construction of physics based models and the risk of not capturing rich and complex system dynamics through models that are too simplistic. In recent years—with the growing deployment of sensors in physical and robotics systems—large amount of operational data have been collected, such as in smart buildings Suryadevara et al. (2015), legged robotics Meger et al. (2015) and manipulators Deisenroth et al. (2011). Using these data, the system dynamics can be learned directly and then automatically updated at periodic intervals. One popular method is to parameterize these complex system dynamics using deep neural networks to capturing complex relationships He et al. (2016); Vaswani et al. (2017), yet few research investigated how to integrate deep learning models into real-time closed-loop control of physical systems.

A key reason that deep neural networks have not been directly applied in control is that even though they provide good performances in learning system behaviors, optimization on top of these networks is challenging Kawaguchi (2016). A deep neural network, for example, may be much better in learning the relationship between temperature set points in a building and its power consumption than a linear model, yet it is not necessarily the case that it would be better to be used to optimize the set points for energy consumption reduction. Similar for robotics applications Bekey & Goldberg (2012), one could utilize neural networks to represent the complex kinematic dynamics of robotic movement, while again, the challenge lies in the control stage where an optimization need to be solved with the system model inside. Neural networks, because of their structures, are generally not convex from input to output. Therefore, many control applications (e.g., where real-time decisions need to be made) choose to favor the computational tractability offered by linear models despite their poor fitting performances.

In this paper we tackle the modeling accuracy and control tractability tradeoff by building on the input convex neural networks (ICNN) in Amos et al. (2017) to both represent system dynamics and to find optimal control policies. By making the neural network convex from input to output, we are able to obtain both good predictive accuracies and tractable computational optimization problems. The overall methodology is shown in Fig. 1. Our proposed method (shown in Fig. 1 (b)) firstly utilizes an input convex network model to learn the system dynamics and then computes the best control decisions via solving a convex model predictive control (MPC) problem, which is tractable and has optimality guarantees. This is different from existing methods that uses model-free end-to-end controller which directly maps input to output (shown in Fig. 1 (a)). Another major contribution of our work is that we explicitly proves that ICNN can represent all convex functions and systems dynamics, and is exponentially more efficient representation than widely used convex piecewise linear approximations Magnani & Boyd (2009).

# 1.1 RELATED WORK

The work in Amos et al. (2017) was an impetus for this paper. The key differences are that the goal in Amos et al. (2017) is to show that ICNN can achieve similar classification performances as conventional neural networks and how the former can be used in inference and prediction problems. Our goal is to use these networks for optimization and closed-loop control, and in a sense that we are more interested in the overall system performances and not directly the performance of the networks. We also extend the class of networks to include RNNs to capture dynamical systems.

Control and decision-making have used deep learning mainly in model-free end-to-end controller settings (shown in Fig. 1 (a)), such as sequential decision making in game Mnih et al. (2013), robotics manipulation Levine & Koltun (2014); Levine et al. (2016), and control of cyber-physical systems Wei et al. (2017); O'Neill et al. (2010). However, much of the success relies heavily on a reinforcement learning setup where the optimal state-action relationship can be learned via a large number of samples. However, many physical systems do not fit into the reinforcement learning process, where both the sample collection is limited by real-time operations, and difficulty to explore the whole

design space since suboptimal actions would lead to disastrous results (e.g., training a controller of a power system by trying different actions may lead to blackouts). Moreover, there are usually model constraints in physical systems (e.g., the largest turning angle for autonomous cars, peak output for building cooling system and maximum speed for robot manipulation) which could neither be directly modeled nor represented efficiently by end-to-end policies.

To address the above sample efficiency, safety and model constraints incompatibility concerns faced by model-free reinforcement learning algorithms in physical system control, we consider a model-based control approach in this work. Model-based control algorithms often involves two stages - system identification and controller design. For the system identification stage, the goal is to learn a fixed form of system model to minimize some prediction error Ljung (1998). Most efficient model-based control algorithms have used a relatively simple function estimator for the system dynamics identification Nagabandi et al. (2018), such as linear model Ma et al. (2012) and Gaussian processes Meger et al. (2015); Deisenroth et al. (2011). These simplified models are sample-efficient to learn, and can be nicely incorporated in the sub-sequent optimal control problems. However, such simple models may not have enough representation capacity in modeling large-scale or high-dimension systems with nonlinear dynamics. Deep neural networks (DNNs) feature powerful representation capability, while the main challenge of using DNNs for system identification is that such models are typically highly non-linear and non-convex Kawaguchi (2016), which causes great difficulty for following decision making. Our work shows how the proposed ICNN control algorithm achieves the benefits from both sides of the world. By making the neural network convex from input to output, we are able to both obtain good identification accuracies and tractable computational optimization problems.

A recent work from Nagabandi et al. (2018) is close in spirit as our proposed method. Similarly, the authors use a model-based approach for robotics control, where they first fit a neural network for the system dynamics and then use the fitted network in an MPC loop. However, since Nagabandi et al. (2018) use conventional NN for system identification, they cannot solve the MPC problem to global optimality. Instead, they use a random shooting method where they choose K random action sequences and choose the action sequence which gives the lowest cost. In section 4.1, we conducted a thorough comparison against their method in four benchmark MuJoCo locomotion tasks: swimmer, half-cheetah, hopper and ant, and demonstrated that our proposed method could achieve on average  $10\%$  higher accumulated reward with significantly less computational time (only  $\frac{1}{10}$ ), due to the good representation power of ICNNs (Theorem 1) and nice mathematical property.

# 2 CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL WITH INPUT CONVEX NEURAL NETWORKS

In this paper, we consider the settings where a neural network is used in a closed-loop system. The fundamental goal is to optimize system performance which is beyond the learning performance of network on its own. In this section we describe how input convex neural networks (ICNN) can be extremely useful in these systems by considering two related problems. First, we show how ICNN perform in single-shot optimization problems. Then we extend the results to an input convex recurrent neural networks (ICRNN), which allows us to both capture systems' complex dynamics and make time-series decisions.

# 2.1 SINGLE-SHOT PROBLEM

Constructing a feed-forward neural network that is convex from input to output is not difficult. The following proposition in Amos et al. (2017) states a simple sufficient condition for a neural network to be input convex:

Proposition 1. The feedforward neural network in Fig. 2(a) is convex from input to output if all the weights between the layers  $\mathbf{W}_{2:k}$  are nonnegative and all of the activation functions are convex and nondecreasing (e.g. ReLU).

This proposition follows directly from composition of convex functions Boyd & Vandenberghe (2004); Amos et al. (2017). Although it allows for any increasing convex activation functions, in this paper we work with the popular ReLU activation function. One notable addition in ICNN are the direct "passthrough" layers connecting input to hidden layers for better representation power, which are shown in Fig. 2(a).

One notable addition is the direct "passthrough" layers  $\mathbf{D}_{2:k}$  that connect the inputs to hidden units for better model representation ability. (b) The proposed input convex recurrent neural networks (ICRNN) architectures, where  $\mathbf{V}, W$  are non-negative.

Fundamentally, ICNN allows us to use neural networks in decision making processes by guaranteeing the solution is unique and a global optimal. Since many complex input and output relationships can be learned through deep neural networks, it is natural to consider using the learned network in an optimization problem in the form of

$$
\min  _ {\mathbf {x}} f (\mathbf {x}; \mathbf {W}) \tag {1a}
$$

$$
s. t. x \in \mathcal {X}, \tag {1b}
$$

where  $\mathcal{X}$  is a convex feasible space. Then if  $f$  is an ICNN, optimizing over  $\mathbf{x}$  is a convex problem, which can be solved efficiently to global optimality. Of course, since the weights of the network are restricted to be nonnegative, the performance of the network (e.g., classification) may be worse. A toy example we gave in Appendix A shows that trading off classification performance with tractability can be preferable.

# 2.2 CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS

In addition to the single-shot optimization problem in (1), we are interested in optimally controlling a dynamical system. Consider a physical system with discrete-time dynamics, at time step  $t$ , define  $\mathbf{s}_t$  as the system state,  $\mathbf{u}_t$  as the control inputs, and  $y_t$  as the system output. For example, for the real-time control of a building system,  $\mathbf{s}_t$  includes the room temperature, occupancy, etc;  $\mathbf{u}_t$  denotes the building appliance scheduling, room temperature set-points; and output  $y_t$  is the building energy consumption. In addition, we define a joint variable  $\mathbf{x}_t = [\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{u}_t]$  called system inputs, which includes both the system states and control actions.

The time evolution of the system is described by

$$
y _ {t} = f \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t}, \mathbf {u} _ {t}\right), \tag {2a}
$$

$$
\mathbf {s} _ {t + 1} = g \left(\mathbf {s} _ {t}, \mathbf {u} _ {t}\right), \tag {2b}
$$

where (2b) describes the coupling between the current inputs to the future system states.

Physical systems described by (2) usually have significant inertia in the sense that the outcome of any control actions is delayed in time and there are significant couplings across time periods. To model such temporal dependency, we propose to use recurrent neural networks (instead of feed-forward neural network) to model the time evolution of the system dynamics. Recurrent networks carry an internal state of the system, which introduces coupling with previous inputs to the system. Fig. 2(b) shows the proposed input convex recurrent neural networks (ICRNN) structure. This network maps from input  $\mathbf{x}$  to output  $y$  with memory unit  $\mathbf{z}$ , using the architecture that for each time step  $t$ :

$$
\mathbf {z} _ {t} = \sigma_ {1} \left(\mathbf {U} \mathbf {x} _ {t} + \mathbf {W} \mathbf {z} _ {t - 1} + \mathbf {D} _ {2} \mathbf {x} _ {t - 1}\right), \tag {3}
$$

$$
y _ {t} = \sigma_ {2} \left(\mathbf {V} \mathbf {z} _ {t} + \mathbf {D} _ {1} \mathbf {z} _ {t - 1} + \mathbf {D} _ {3} \mathbf {x} _ {t}\right), \tag {4}
$$

If we unroll the dynamics with respect to time, we have  $y_{t} = f(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2},\dots,\mathbf{x}_{t};\theta)$  where  $\theta = [\mathbf{U},\mathbf{V},\mathbf{W},\mathbf{D_1},\mathbf{D_2},\mathbf{D_3}]$  are network parameters, and  $\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2}$  denote the nonlinear activation functions. The next proposition states a sufficient condition for the network to be input convex:

Proposition 2. The network shown in Fig. 2(b) is a convex function from input to output if  $V, W$  are non-negative, and all activation functions are convex and nondecreasing (e.g. ReLU).

The proof of this proposition again follows directly from composition rules of convex functions.

Once we train an ICRNN to represent the system dynamics, the optimal receding horizon control problem at time  $t$  can then be written as,

$$
\underset {\mathbf {u} _ {t}, \mathbf {u} _ {t + 1}, \dots , \mathbf {u} _ {t + T}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} C (\mathbf {x}, \mathbf {y}) = \sum_ {\tau = t} ^ {t + T} J \left(\mathbf {x} _ {\tau}, y _ {\tau}\right) \tag {5a}
$$

$$
\text {s u b j e c t} \quad y _ {\tau} = f \left(\mathbf {x} _ {\tau - n _ {w}}, \mathbf {x} _ {\tau - n _ {w} + 1}, \dots , \mathbf {x} _ {\tau}\right), \forall \tau \in [ t, t + T ] \tag {5b}
$$

$$
\mathbf {s} _ {\tau} = g \left(\mathbf {x} _ {\tau - n _ {w}}, \mathbf {x} _ {\tau - n _ {w} + 1}, \dots , \mathbf {x} _ {\tau - 1}, \mathbf {u} _ {\tau}\right), \forall \tau \in [ t, t + T ] \tag {5c}
$$

$$
\mathbf {s} _ {\tau} \in \mathcal {S} _ {\text {f e a s i b l e}}, \forall \tau \in [ t, t + T ] \tag {5d}
$$

$$
\mathbf {u} _ {\tau} \in \mathcal {U} _ {\text {f e a s i b l e}}, \forall \tau \in [ t, t + T ] \tag {5e}
$$

where  $J(\mathbf{x}_t, y_t)$  be the control system cost incurs at time  $t$ , that is a function of both the system inputs  $\mathbf{x}_t$  and output  $y_t$ . Note  $\mathbf{x}_t = [\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{u}_t]$  is a collection of both the system states  $\mathbf{s}_t$  and control actions  $\mathbf{u}_t$ .  $f(\cdot)$  and  $g(\cdot)$  in Eq. (5b)-(5c) are parameterized as ICRNNs, which represent the system dynamics from sequence of inputs  $(\mathbf{x}_{\tau - n_w}, \mathbf{x}_{\tau - n_w + 1}, \dots, \mathbf{x}_{\tau})$  to the system output  $y_{\tau}$ , and the dynamics from control actions to system states, respectively. And  $n_w$  is the memory window length of recurrent neural network. (5d) and (5e) are the constraints on system states and control actions respectively.

Optimization problem in (5) is a convex optimization with respect to inputs  $\mathbf{u}$ , provided the cost function  $J(\mathbf{x}_{\tau},y_{\tau}) = J(\mathbf{s}_{\tau},\mathbf{u}_{\tau},y_{\tau})$  is convex with respect to  $\mathbf{u}_t$  and convex, nondecreasing with respect to  $\mathbf{s}_{\tau}$  and  $y_{\tau}$ . Since the problem is convex, a number of algorithms can be used. The gradients or sub-gradients from the cost function to the inputs can be calculated via back-propagation with the modification that the cost is propagated to the input rather than the weights of the network. Let  $\mathbf{u}^{*} = \{\mathbf{u}_{t}^{*},\mathbf{u}_{t + 1}^{*},\dots,\mathbf{u}_{t + T}^{*}\}$  be the optimal solution of the optimization problem at time  $t$ . Then the first element of  $\mathbf{u}^{*}$  is implemented to the real-time system control, that is  $\mathbf{u}_t^*$ . The optimization problem is repeated at time  $t + 1$ , based on the updated state prediction using  $\mathbf{u}_t^*$ , yielding a model predictive control strategy.

# 3 EFFICIENCY AND REPRESENTATION POWER OF ICNN

This section provides theoretical analysis of input convex neural network.

# 3.1 REPRESENTATION POWER OF INPUT CONVEX NEURAL NETWORK

Definition 1. Given a function  $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ , we say that the function  $\hat{f}$  approximate  $f$  within  $\epsilon$  if  $|f(\mathbf{x}) - \hat{f}(\mathbf{x})| \leq \epsilon$  for all  $\mathbf{x}$  in the domain of  $f$ .

Theorem 1. [Representation power of ICNN] For any Lipschitz convex function over a compact domain, there exists a neural network with nonnegative weights and ReLU activation functions that approximates it within  $\epsilon$ .

Lemma 1. Given a continuous Lipschitz convex function  $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$  with compact domain and  $\epsilon > 0$ , it can be approximated within  $\epsilon$  by maximum of a finite number of affine functions. That is, there exists  $\hat{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \max_{i=1,\dots,N} \{\mu_i^T\mathbf{x} + b_i\}$  such that  $|f(\mathbf{x}) - \hat{f}(\mathbf{x})| \leq \epsilon$  for all  $\mathbf{x} \in \text{dom} f$ .

Sketch of proof for Theorem 1. Supposing Lemma 1 is true, the proof of Theorem 1 boils down to showing that neural network with nonnegative weights and ReLU activation functions can exactly represent a maximum of affine functions. The proof is constructive. We first construct a neural network with ReLU activation functions and both positive and negative weights, then we show that the weights between different layers of the network can be restricted to be nonnegative by a simple duplication trick. Specifically, since the weights in the input layer and pass through layers in the

ICNN can be negative, we simply add a negation of each input variable (e.g. both  $\mathbf{x}$  and  $-\mathbf{x}$  are given as inputs) to the network. These variables need satisfy a consistency constraint since one is the negation of the other. Since this constraint is linear, it preserves the convexity of optimization problems. The details of the proofs are given in the Appendix B.

This proof is similar in spirit to theorems in Hanin (2017); Arora et al. (2016). The key new result is a simpler construction than the one used in Hanin (2017) and the restriction to nonnegative weights between the layers.

Similar to Theorem 1, an analogous result about the representation power of ICRNN can be shown for systems with convex dynamics. Given a dynamical system described by rolled out system dynamics  $y_{t} = f(\mathbf{u}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{u}_{t})$  is convex, then there exists a recurrent neural network with nonnegative weights and ReLU activation functions that approximates it within  $\epsilon$ . A broad range of systems can be captured by this model. For example, the linear quadratic (Gaussian) regulator problem can be described using a ICRNN if we identify  $y$  as the cost of the regulator Skogestad & Postlethwaite (2007); Boyd et al. (1994). An example of a nonlinear system is the control of electrochemical batteries. It can be shown from first principles that the degradation of these types of batteries is convex in their charge and discharge actions Shi et al. (2018); Abdulla et al. (2018) and our framework offers a powerful data-driven way to control batteries found in in electric vehicles, cell phones, and power systems.

# 3.2 ICNN VS. CONVEX PIECEWISE LINEAR FITTING

In the proof of Theorem 1, we first approximate a convex function by a maximum of affine functions then construct a neural network according to this maximum. Then a natural question is why learn a neural network and not directly the affine functions in the maximum? This approach was taken in Magnani & Boyd (2009), where a convex piecewise-linear function (max of affine functions) are directly learned from data through a regression problem.

A key reason that we propose to use ICNN (or ICRNN) to fit a function rather than directly finding a maximum of affine functions is that the former is a much more efficient parameterization than the latter. As stated in Theorem 2, a maximum of  $K$  affine functions can be represented by an ICNN with  $K$  layers, where each layer only requires a single ReLU activation function. However, given a single layer ICNN with  $K$  ReLU activation functions, it may take a maximum of  $2^{K}$  affine functions to represent it exactly. Therefore in practice, it would be much easier to train a good ICNN than finding a good set of affine functions.

# Theorem 2. [Efficiency of Representation]

1. Let  $f_{ICNN} : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$  be an input convex neural network with  $K$  ReLU activation functions. Then  $\Omega(2^K)$  functions are required to represent  $f_{ICNN}$  using a max of affine functions.  
2. Let  $f_{CPL} : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$  be a max of  $K$  affine functions. Then  $O(K)$  activation functions are sufficient to represent  $f_{CPL}$  exactly with an ICNN.

The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix C.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we verify the effectiveness of ICNN and ICRNN by presenting experimental results on two decision-making problems: continuous control benchmarks on MuJoco locomotion tasks Brockman et al. (2016); Todorov et al. (2012) and energy management of reference large-scale commercial building Crawley et al. (2001), respectively. Proposed method can be used as a flexible building block in decision making problems, where we use ICNN to represent system dynamics for MuJoco simulators, and we use ICRNN in an end-to-end fashion to find the optimal control inputs. Both examples demonstrate that proposed method: 1) discovers the connection between controllable variables and the system dynamics or cost objectives; 2) is lightweight and sample-efficient; 3) achieves generalizable and more stable control performances compared with previous model-based reinforcement learning and simplified linear control approaches.

# 4.1 MUJOCO LOCOMOTION TASKS

Experimental Setup We consider four simulated robotic locomotion tasks: swimmer, half-cheetah, hopper, ant implemented in MuJoCo under the OpenAI rllab framework Duan et al. (2016). We train and represent the locomotion state transition dynamics  $\mathbf{x}_{t + 1} = g(\mathbf{x}_t,\mathbf{u}_t)$  using a 2-layer ICNN with ReLU nonlinearities, which could be integrated into the following finite-horizon control problem to find the optimal action sequence  $\mathbf{u}_t,\dots ,\mathbf{u}_{t + H}$  for fixed  $H$  ..

$$
\underset {\mathbf {u} _ {t}, \dots , \mathbf {u} _ {t + H}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} - \sum_ {\tau = 0} ^ {H} r \left(\mathbf {x} _ {t + \tau}, \mathbf {u} _ {t + \tau}\right) \tag {6a}
$$

subject to  $\mathbf{x}_{t + \tau +1} = g(\mathbf{x}_{t + \tau},\mathbf{u}_{t + \tau}),\forall \tau \in [t,t + H]$  (6b)

$$
\mathbf {u} _ {\tau} \in \mathcal {U} _ {\text {f e a s i b l e}}, \forall \tau \in [ t, t + H ] \tag {6c}
$$

where the objective (6a) is a known convex reward function related to observations such as velocity and positions (listed in the Appendix D). To achieve better model generalization on locomotion dynamics, we also followed Nagabandi et al. (2018), and applied DAGGER Ross et al. (2011) to iteratively collect labeled robotic rollouts and train the supervised dynamics model (6b) using on-policy locomotion samples. See Appendix D for further simulation hyperparameters and experimental details. For each aggregated iterations of collecting rollouts data and training ICNN model, we validate the controller performance on standalone validation rollouts by optimally solving (6).

Baselines We compare our system modeling and continuous control method with state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithm Nagabandi et al. (2018), where the authors used a normal multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) model to parameterize the system dynamics (6b). We refer to their method as random-shooting algorithm, since they can not solve (6) to optimality, and they used pre-defined number of random-shooting control sequences (denoted as  $K$ ) to query the trained MLP and find a best sequence as the rollout policy. Such method is able to find good control policies in the degree of  $10^{4}$  timesteps, which are much more sample-efficient than model-free RL methods Duan et al. (2016); Mnih et al. (2015). To make fair comparisons with baseline method, we keep the same setup on the rollouts number, initial random action training. Our framework makes the neural networks convex w.r.t input by adding passthrough links to the 2-layer model and keeping the second layer weights W nonnegative. We evaluate the performance of both algorithms on three randomly selected fixed random seeds for four tasks. Similar to the fine tuning steps in Nagabandi et al. (2018), control policies found by ICNN can also be plugged in as initialized policies for subsequent model-free reinforcement learning algorithms.

Continuous Control Performance During training, we found both ICNN and MLP are able to predict robotic states quite accurately based on (6b). This provides a good system dynamics model which is beneficial to solve control policies. The control performances are shown in Fig. 3, where we compare the average reward of proposed method and random-shooting method with  $K = 100$  over 10 validation rollouts during each aggregated iteration (see Fig. 7 in Appendix D.4 for random shooting performance with varying  $K$ ). The policy found by ICNN outperforms the random-shooting method in all settings with varying  $H$  for all of the four locomotion tasks.

Intuitively, ICNN shall be performing better when the action space is larger, since random-shooting method can not search through the action space efficiently with a fixed  $K$ . This is illustrated in the example of ant, where with more training samples aggregated and MLP model representing more accurate dynamics, random-shooting gets stuck to find better control policies and there is little improvement reflected in the control performance. Moreover, since we are skipping the expensive process on calculating rewards of each random shooting trajectory and finding the best one, our method only implements ICNN inference step based on (6) and is much faster than random shooting methods in most settings, especially when  $K$  is large (see Table. 2 for wall-clock time in Appendix D.3). This also indicates that our method is even much more sample-efficient than off-the-shelf model-free RL methods, where we use  $\approx 100 \times$  less training data to reach similar validation rewards Duan et al. (2016); Mnih et al. (2015).

to reduce its energy consumption. Building energy management remains to be a hard problem in control area. The exact system dynamics are unknown and hard to model due to the complex heating transfer dynamics, time-varying environments and the scale of the system in terms of states and actions Kouro et al. (2009). At time  $t$ , we assume the building's running profile  $\mathbf{x}_t \coloneqq [\mathbf{s}_t, \mathbf{u}_t]$  is available, where  $\mathbf{s}_t$  denotes building system states, including outside temperature, room temperature measurements, zone occupancies and etc.  $\mathbf{u}_t$  denotes a collection of control actions such as room temperature set points and appliance schedule. The  $t$  step output is the electricity consumption  $P_t$ .

This is a model predictive control problem in the sense that we want to find the best control inputs that minimize the overall energy consumption of building by looking ahead several time steps. To achieve this goal, we firstly learn an ICRNN model  $f(\cdot)$  of the building dynamics, which is trained to minimize the error between  $P_{t}$  and  $f(\mathbf{x}_{t - n_w},\dots,\mathbf{x}_t)$ , while  $n_w$  denotes the memory window of

recurrent neural networks. Then we solve:

$$
\underset {\mathbf {u} _ {t}, \dots , \mathbf {u} _ {t + T}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \quad \sum_ {\tau = 0} ^ {T} f \left(\mathbf {x} _ {t + \tau - n _ {w}}, \dots , \mathbf {x} _ {t + \tau}\right) \tag {7a}
$$

$$
\text {s u b j e c t} \quad \mathbf {s} _ {t + \tau} = g \left(\mathbf {x} _ {t + \tau - n _ {w}}, \dots , \mathbf {x} _ {t + \tau - 1}, \mathbf {u} _ {t + \tau}\right), \forall \tau \tag {7b}
$$

$$
\underline {{\mathbf {u}}} _ {t + \tau} \leq \mathbf {u} _ {t + \tau} \leq \overline {{\mathbf {u}}} _ {t + \tau}, \forall \tau \tag {7c}
$$

$$
\underline {{\mathbf {s}}} _ {t + \tau} \leq \mathbf {s} _ {t + \tau} \leq \overline {{\mathbf {s}}} _ {t + \tau}, \forall \tau \tag {7d}
$$

where the objective (7a) is minimizing the total energy consumption in future  $T$  steps ( $T$  is the model predictive control horizon), and (7b) is used for modeling building states, in which  $g(\cdot)$  are parameterized as ICRNNs. Note that the formulation (7) is also flexible with different loss functions. For instance, in practice, we could reuse trained dynamics model (7b), and integrate electricity prices into the overall objective so that we could directly learn real-time actions to minimize electricity bills (please refer to Appendix E for more results). The constraints on control actions  $\mathbf{u}_t$  and system states  $\mathbf{s}_t$  are given in (7c) and (7d). For instance, the temperature set points as well as real measurements should not exceed user-defined comfort regions.

To test the performance of the proposed method, we set up a 12-story large office building, which is a reference EnergyPlus commercial building model from US Department of Energy (DoE)  $^2$ , with a total floor area of 498, 584 square feet which is divided into 16 separate zones. By using the whole year's weather profile, we simulate the building running through the year and record  $(\mathbf{x}_t, P_t)$  with a resolution of 10 minutes. We use 10 months' data to train the ICRNN and subsequent 2 months' data for testing. We use 39 building system state variables  $\mathbf{s}_t$  (uncontrollable), along with 16 control variables  $\mathbf{u}_t$ . Output is a single value of building energy consumption at each time step. We set the model predictive control horizon  $T = 36$  (six hours).

We employ an ICRNN with 1 recurrent layer of dimension 200 with 2 subsequent fully-connected layers to fit both the building input-output dynamics  $f(\cdot)$ . The model is trained to minimize the MSE between its predictions and the actual building energy consumption using stochastic gradient descent. We use the same network structure and training scheme to fit the state transition dynamics  $g(\cdot)$ .

Baseline We set the model-based forecasting and optimization benchmark using an linear resistor-circuit (RC) circuit model to represent the heat transfer in building systems, and solve for the optimal control actions via MPC Ma et al. (2012). At each step, MPC algorithm takes into account the forecasted states of the building based on the fitted RC model and implements the current step control actions. We also compare the performance of ICRNN against the conventionally trained RNN in terms of building dynamics fitting performance and control performance. To solve the MPC problem with conventional RNN models, we also use gradient-based method, where the gradients can be calculated via back-propagation of the cost function to the input. However, since conventional RNN models are generally not convex from input to output, there is no guarantee to reach a global optimum (or even a local one).

Results In terms of the fitting performance, ICRNN provides a competitive result compared to conventional RNN model. The overall test root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.054 for ICRNN and 0.051 for conventional RNN, both of which are much smaller than the error made by RC model (0.240). Fig. 4(a) shows the fitting performance on 5 working days in test data. This illustrates the good performance of ICRNN in modeling building HVAC system dynamics. Then by using the learned ICRNN model of building dynamics, we obtain the suggested room control actions  $u_{t}^{*}$  by solving the optimal building control problem (7). As shown in Fig. 4(b), with the same constraints on building temperature interval of  $[19^{\circ}C, 24^{\circ}C]$ , the building energy consumption is reduced by  $23.25\%$  after implementing the new temperature set points calculated by ICRNN. On the contrary, since there is no guarantee for finding optimal control actions by optimizing over conventional RNN's input, the control solutions given by conventional RNN could only reduce  $11.73\%$  of electricity. Solutions given by RC model only saves  $4.07\%$  of electricity. More importantly, in Fig. 4(c) we demonstrate the control actions outputted by our method against MPC with conventional RNN in two randomly select building zones, the building basement and top floor central area. It shows that our proposed approach is able to find a group of stable control actions for the building system control.

While in the conventional RNN case, it generates control set points which varies dramatically, which is undesirable for physical system control.

Figure 4: Results for constrained optimization of building energy management. (a) ICRNN is able to model the building dynamics as accurately as conventional RNN; (b) Compared to conventional RNN model, ICRNN finds control actions which lead to  $11.52\%$  more of energy savings, and (c) ICRNN provides stable control actions while decisions generated by conventional RNN varies dramatically.

# 5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this work we proposed a novel optimal control framework that uses deep neural networks engineered to be convex from the input to the output. This framework bridges machine learning and control by representing system dynamics using input convex neural networks. We show that many interesting data-driven control problems can be cast as convex optimization problems using the proposed network architecture. Experiments on both benchmark Mujoco locomotion tasks and building energy management demonstrate our methodology's potential in a variety of control and optimization problems.
