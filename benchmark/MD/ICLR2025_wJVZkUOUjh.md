# ABSTRACT

Explanations in machine learning are critical for trust, transparency, and fairness. Yet, complex disagreements among these explanations limit the reliability and applicability of machine learning models, especially in high-stakes environments. We formalize four fundamental ranking-based explanation disagreement problems and introduce a novel framework, EXplanation AGREEMENT (EXAGREE), to bridge diverse interpretations in explainable machine learning, particularly from stakeholder-centered perspectives. Our approach leverages a Rashomon set for attribution predictions and then optimizes within this set to identify Stakeholder-Aligned Explanation Models (SAEMs) that minimize disagreement with diverse stakeholder needs while maintaining predictive performance. Rigorous empirical analysis on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that EXAGREE reduces explanation disagreement and improves fairness across subgroups in various domains. EXAGREE not only provides researchers with a new direction for studying explanation disagreement problems but also offers data scientists a tool for making better-informed decisions in practical applications.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

As machine learning models gain prominence in critical fields such as healthcare, science and finance, the demand for transparent explanations of their predictions has intensified, particularly in high-stakes decision-making scenarios (Kailkhura et al., 2019; Wiens & Shenoy, 2018; Carvalho et al., 2022; Agarwal et al., 2022; Ghassemi et al., 2021). However, a significant challenge has emerged: explanation disagreement, where explanations from different methods or models conflict with each other (Krishna et al., 2022; Rudin, 2019; Li & Barnard, 2024). This disagreement hinders the potential impact and trustworthiness of machine learning models, especially when the consequences of model decisions can have significant real-world impacts.

Explanation disagreement stems from multiple, complex sources. Multiple model-agnostic post-hoc explanation methods often yield inconsistent results for the same model and prediction (Krishna et al., 2022). The involvement of various stakeholders, each with unique expertise and objectives, further complicates model explanation (Imrie et al., 2023; Binns, 2018; Hong et al., 2020). Even

interpretable models, which are theoretically more transparent, can produce explanations that diverge from stakeholder expectations or domain knowledge. Moreover, the existence of multiple well-performing models for a given task, known as the Rashomon set, introduces another layer of variability in explanations (Fisher et al., 2019; Rudin, 2019; Dong & Rudin, 2020; Ghorbani et al., 2019; Adebayo et al., 2018). Traditional approaches have primarily focused on developing new explanation methods or improving model interpretability. However, limited attention has been given to addressing the fundamental issue of explanation disagreement (Krishna et al., 2022; Li & Barnard, 2024). More related works are provided in the Appendix B.

To bridge this gap, we introduce EXplanation AGREEm (EXAGREE), a novel framework designed to enhance explanation agreement in explainable machine learning under ranking supervision. EXAGREE adopts a stakeholder-centered approach that prioritizes the satisfaction of diverse human needs, leveraging the Rashomon set concept to identify Stakeholder-Aligned Explanation Models (SAEMs) that provide more fair, faithful, and trustworthy explanations, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (Fisher et al., 2019; Hsu & Calmon, 2022; Dong & Rudin, 2020; Li & Barnard, 2023b; Rudin et al., 2024).

Our work makes several significant contributions to the field of explainable machine learning:

- We formalize four fundamental explanation disagreement problems in Sec. 2: stakeholder disagreement, model disagreement, explanation method disagreement, and ground truth disagreement, providing a structured foundation for future research in the field.  
- By emphasizing the purpose of explanations, we reframe these complex challenges from a stakeholder-centered perspective in Sec. 2, aiming to satisfy diverse human needs. This novel viewpoint offers a potential pathway for resolving these disagreement conflicts.  
- We propose EXAGREE, the first framework that aims to enhance both explanation faithfulness and fairness by leveraging the Rashomon set concept, mitigating explanation disagreement while preserving model performance in Sec. 3. This approach utilizes the potential of model disagreement as a powerful means to resolve stakeholder disagreement.  
- Through rigorous empirical analysis in Sec. 4 on the OpenXAI (Agarwal et al., 2022) disagreement measurement benchmark, we gain new insights into the nature of explanation disagreement. Our experiments demonstrate EXAGREE's effectiveness in identifying SAEMs that improve explanation agreement for diverse stakeholders.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

Problem Statement We formalize the explanation disagreement problem in the context of feature attribution for machine learning models, where the attribution assigned to a feature is a measure of that feature's importance to the model's prediction (Krishna et al., 2022; Sundararajan & Najmi, 2020). We denote a set of good models, feature attributions, and their corresponding rankings in this framework, with a summary of notations provided in Appendix F Table 6.

Let  $\mathcal{M}$  be a set of good models (a Rashomon set), where each model in the set meets a predefined performance threshold  $\epsilon$  for a given task  $(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{y})\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times (p + 1)}$ , as defined by Fisher et al. (2019), Dong & Rudin (2020), Xin et al. (2022), and Li & Barnard (2023a):

$$
\mathcal {M} = \{M: \mathcal {L} (M (\mathbf {X}), \mathbf {y}) \leq (1 + \epsilon) \mathcal {L} (M ^ {*} (\mathbf {X}), \mathbf {y}) \}. \tag {1}
$$

For a model  $M \in \mathcal{M}$  and an explanation method  $\varphi \in \Phi$ , we calculate feature attributions as:  $\mathbf{a}^{M,\varphi} = (a_1^{M,\varphi}, a_2^{M,\varphi}, \ldots, a_p^{M,\varphi})$ . These attributions yield a ranking:  $\mathbf{r}^{M,\varphi} = (r_1^{M,\varphi}, r_2^{M,\varphi}, \ldots, r_p^{M,\varphi})$ , where  $r_i^{M,\varphi}$  represents the rank of feature  $i$ . The ranking can be derived based on the ordering of attributions:  $a_{(1)} \succ a_{(2)} \succ \ldots \succ a_{(p)}$ , where  $a_{(i)}$  denotes the  $i$ -th largest attribution. For interpretable models  $M_{\mathcal{I}} \in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{I}} \subset \mathcal{M}$ , such as decision trees and linear regressors, we can obtain ground truth attributions  $\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{true}}^{M_{\mathcal{I}}}$  and rankings  $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{true}}^{M_{\mathcal{I}}}$ . Feature attributions and rankings serve as explanations for model behaviour and form the basis for understanding how different explanations may conflict with each other.

# 2.1 RANKING-BASED EXPLANATION DISAGREEMENT PROBLEM

While the broader issue of explanation disagreement has been discussed in existing literature, the focus has been fragmented. For instance, Rudin (2019) focused on model-related issues, Sundarara-

jan & Najmi (2020) examined explanation method variations, Miller (2023) explored stakeholder perspectives, and Krishna et al. (2022) investigated the disagreement problem from a practitioner's viewpoint. We extend beyond these individual focuses by explicitly formulating a ranking-based disagreement problem across multiple scenarios:

1. Stakeholder Disagreement: Different stakeholders in  $S$  may prefer different rankings

$$
\exists k, l \in \mathcal {S}, k \neq l: \mathbf {r} ^ {k} \neq \mathbf {r} ^ {l}.
$$

This disagreement can arise from varying expertise, requirements, or objectives among stakeholders. For instance, a data scientist might prioritize statistical significance, while a domain expert may value features based on domain knowledge. These divergent perspectives can lead to conflicting interpretations of model behaviour and decision-making processes.

2. Model Disagreement: Different models in  $\mathcal{M}$  can produce different rankings

$$
\exists M, M ^ {\prime} \in \mathcal {M}, M \neq M ^ {\prime}, \varphi \in \Phi : \mathbf {r} ^ {M, \varphi} \neq \mathbf {r} ^ {M ^ {\prime}, \varphi}.
$$

This scenario occurs when multiple models with similar performance yield different feature attributions, considering a Rashomon set. For example, a linear regression model and a neural network might assign different importances to features, despite achieving comparable predictive accuracy.

3. Explanation Method Disagreement: Different explanation methods in  $\Phi$  can yield different rankings for the same model

$$
\exists M \in \mathcal {M}, \varphi , \varphi^ {\prime} \in \Phi , \varphi \neq \varphi^ {\prime}: \mathbf {r} ^ {M, \varphi} \neq \mathbf {r} ^ {M, \varphi^ {\prime}}.
$$

This scenario highlights the variability in post-hoc explanation methods. For instance, LIME and SHAP, two popular explanation methods, might provide different feature importance rankings for the same model.

4. Ground Truth Disagreement: Ground truth interpretations from interpretable models can conflict with post-hoc explanations or stakeholders' needs

$$
\exists M _ {\mathcal {I}} \in \mathcal {M} _ {\mathcal {I}}, \varphi \in \Phi : \mathbf {r} ^ {M _ {\mathcal {I}}, \varphi} \neq \mathbf {r} _ {\text {t r u e}} ^ {M _ {\mathcal {I}}}; \exists k \in \mathcal {S}, M _ {\mathcal {I}} \in \mathcal {M} _ {\mathcal {I}}: \mathbf {r} ^ {k} \neq \mathbf {r} _ {\text {t r u e}} ^ {M _ {\mathcal {I}}}.
$$

For example, a post-hoc explanation method applied to a linear regression model might yield feature importances that differ from the model's coefficients.

Remark 1. While these scenarios provide a foundation for understanding explanation disagreements, practical situations often involve more complex, interconnected challenges, named compound disagreements. Different models may respond differently to various explanation methods ( $\exists M, M' \in \mathcal{M}, \varphi, \varphi' \in \Phi : \mathbf{r}^{M,\varphi} \neq \mathbf{r}^{M,\varphi'} \neq \mathbf{r}^{M',\varphi} \neq \mathbf{r}^{M',\varphi'}$ ). In more complex cases, disagreements may span stakeholders, models, and methods.

# 2.2 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

To address the explanation disagreement problem, we aim to identify a well-performing model that minimizes disagreement (or maximizes agreement) between model explanations and stakeholder expectations. This approach is rooted in the principle of human-centered decision-making (Aggarwal et al., 2016; Miller, 2019), which prioritizes satisfying the requirements of relevant stakeholders.

By focusing on the specific needs of stakeholders, we intentionally simplify the complex nature of compound disagreements, allowing for a more targeted and practical solution. We formalize this as an end-to-end optimization problem, considering each stakeholder's expectations independently while maintaining model performance:

$$
\min  _ {M} \quad \mathcal {O} _ {i} \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {M, \varphi}, \mathbf {r} ^ {i}\right) \quad \forall i \in \mathcal {S}, \quad \text {s . t .} \quad \mathcal {L} (M (\mathbf {X}), \mathbf {y}) \leq \tau \tag {2}
$$

where  $\mathcal{O}(\cdot, \cdot)$  is a suitable disagreement measure between rankings,  $\tau$  is the performance threshold, and  $\mathbf{r}^i$  is the expected ranking of stakeholder  $i$ . By treating each stakeholder  $i \in S$  separately, we address their unique expectations, using their individual feature rankings as distinct optimization targets. In this work, we will focus on exploring a set of well-performing models to achieve this objective, detailed in Sec. 3.

Remark 2. This objective is general and open-ended due to the nature of the explanation problem. The choice of explanation method and disagreement metrics are left unspecified here, allowing for further exploration and development in subsequent studies.

# 2.3 EVALUATION MATRICES

To comprehensively assess the disagreement between explanations, we employ a set of quantitative metrics adapted from the OpenXAI benchmark (Agarwal et al., 2022). These metrics evaluate both the faithfulness and fairness of explanation methods. The core principle underlying our evaluation is that higher agreement between rankings implies greater faithfulness, which can be formalized as:

$$
\text {a g r e m e n t} \propto \text {f a i t h f u l n e s s} \propto - \mathcal {O} (\mathbf {r}, \mathbf {r} ^ {*})
$$

Our evaluation includes faithfulness assessment and fairness assessment. Faithfulness measures how accurately an explanation reflects the true behavior of the underlying model, while fairness assesses the consistency of explanation quality across different subgroups (Dai et al., 2022). Faithfulness metrics contain Feature Agreement (FA), Rank Agreement (RA), Sign Agreement (SA), Signed Rank Agreement (SRA), Pairwise Rank Agreement (PRA), Rank Correlation (RC), Prediction Gap on Important feature perturbation (PGI), and Unimportant feature perturbation (PGU). Detailed descriptions are presented in the Appendix Table 3.

While our study primarily focuses on global-level feature attributions, we adapt these metrics, originally designed for local-level attributions, by averaging feature attributions across all instances to obtain global attributions. For a detailed description of each metric, please refer to the Appendix.

Remark 3. An ideal explanation should perform well across all assessment metrics. However, explanations may excel in one metric while performing poorly in another, making it challenging to evaluate the overall agreement. To address this in practice, we count the number of times each explanation method achieves the best value across the entire set of metrics.

# 3 EXAGREE: EXPLANATION AGREEMENT FRAMEWORK

EXAGREE is designed to mitigate the challenge of explanation disagreement, by employing a two-stage workflow, as illustrated in Fig.2:

1. Rashomon Set Sampling and Attribution Mapping: This preparatory stage involves two key steps: a) Approximation of similar-performing models from the given dataset using the General Rashomon Subset Sampling (GRS) algorithm (Li et al., 2024). b) Training a Differentiable Mask-based Model to Attribution Network (DMAN) that maps feature attributions from model characterizations for use in the next stage.  
2. Stakeholder-Aligned Explanation Model (SAEM) Identification: In this stage, we identify explanation models that align with stakeholder requirements within the approximated Rashomon set. This is achieved by optimizing a Multi-heads Mask Network (MHMN), which: a) Incorporates the previously trained DMAN for feature attribution mapping. b) Incorporates a Differentiable Sorting Network (DiffSortNet Petersen et al. (2022)) to enable ranking supervision.

The following subsections provide detailed discussions of these components and their roles in the overall framework.

# 3.1 STAGE 1: RASHOMON SET SAMPLING AND Attribution MAPPING

The concept of Rashomon sets provides a powerful framework for addressing the challenge of explanation disagreement (Rudin et al., 2024), which allows us to transform single attribution values into ranges, and enables the search for models with stakeholder-expected rankings within a set of similarly performing models. Rashomon sets naturally relax the performance constraint in our optimization problem and mitigate ground truth disagreement by considering all candidate models within the Rashomon set as viable options. This allows us to reformulate our original optimization problem (Eq. (2)) into:

$$
\min  _ {M \in \mathcal {M}} \mathcal {O} _ {i} \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {M, \varphi}, \mathbf {r} ^ {i}\right) \quad \forall i \in \mathcal {S}. \tag {3}
$$

While various methods exist to explore Rashomon sets Hsu & Calmon (2022); Dong & Rudin (2020); Fisher et al. (2019), we adopt a general Rashomon set sampling algorithm for its generalizability and implementation sparsity to meet our practical requirements (Li et al., 2024). This approach: a) approximates the Rashomon set for a reference black-box model  $M$ , assuming stakeholders are given a black-box model with unknown explanations. b) guarantees a fair and consistent comparison of explanations by using a model-agnostic approach, thus relaxing explanation method disagreement.

Our goal is to identify specific models within this set that meet the desired ranking based on calculated attributions. However, optimizing a model under ranking supervision requires a differentiable mapping function from a model to the corresponding feature attributions, which presents two main challenges: a) model representations in the set as further input. b) the non-linear relationship between feature attributions and model representations.

Remark 4. It's important to note that there is no guarantee that a model with an expected ranking can be found within a Rashomon set. A detailed discussion of ranking in the Rashomon set and proof of this concept is provided in the Appendix D.

Differentiable Mask-to-Attribution Network (DMAN) The above challenges are addressed through: a) the fact that all models in the sampled set can be characterized by masks, providing uniform representations for different models in the Rashomon set. b) a differentiable mapping function from model characterizations (masks) to feature attributions.

We propose the DMAN  $f_{dman}$  as a surrogate model that bridges the gap between models in the Rashomon set and their feature attributions. DMAN is a neural network trained to approximate the relationship between masks (representing models in the Rashomon set) and their corresponding attributions. The training process uses a dataset  $\mathcal{D}_{att} = \{\mathbf{m}_{\mathcal{R}}, \mathbf{A}\}$ , where  $\mathbf{m}_{\mathcal{R}}$  are masks and  $\mathbf{A}$  are corresponding attributions. The parameter optimization of the network is expressed as:

$$
f _ {d m a n, \theta} ^ {*} = \underset {\theta \in \Theta} {\arg \min } \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {M S E}} \left(f _ {d m a n, \theta}, \mathcal {D} _ {a t t}\right) \tag {4}
$$

While DMAN provides an approximation as a surrogate model, its accuracy is crucial for the overall framework. To ensure reliability, we calculate actual attributions when evaluating the final results. This stage allows us to efficiently utilize the Rashomon set for attribution prediction while maintaining a differentiable pipeline for further optimization.

# 3.2 STAGE 2: SAEM IDENTIFICATION

Building on the prior stage, SAEMs can be searched within the approximated Rashomon set. This requires a differentiable function that maps feature attributions to target rankings.

Ranking Supervision and Correlation Metric We employ monotonic differentiable sorting networks in our framework, utilizing the cumulative density function (CDF) of the Cauchy distribution  $f_{\mathcal{C}}$  from the work of Petersen et al. (2022). This network, denoted as  $f_{diffsort}$ , enables ranking supervision where the ground truth order of features is known while their absolute values remain unsupervised.

We adopt Spearman's rank correlation (negative w.r.t agreement) as our measure of disagreement distance (in Eq. (3)) due to its differentiability (Dodge, 2008; Petersen et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022). The correlation for a specific ranking from stakeholder  $i$  can be calculated as:

$$
\rho^ {i} \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {M, \varphi}, \mathbf {r} ^ {i}\right) = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {M , \varphi} , \mathbf {r} ^ {i}\right)}{\operatorname {S t d} \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {M , \varphi}\right) \operatorname {S t d} \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {i}\right)} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(f _ {\text {d i f f s o r t}} \left(\left| \mathbf {a} ^ {M , \varphi} \right|\right) , \mathbf {r} ^ {i}\right)}{\operatorname {S t d} \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {M , \varphi}\right) \operatorname {S t d} \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {i}\right)}. \tag {5}
$$

It's important to note that feature attributions have directions that do not necessarily represent their strength. To address this, we use the absolute value of attributions in the correlation calculation, ensuring both positive and negative importances are appropriately accounted for in the ranking. In practice, stakeholders may or may not require information about the direction of feature importance. To accommodate this variability, we incorporate a sign loss in our optimization process when applicable. Loss function details are discussed in the following section.

# 3.2.1 MULTI-HEADS ARCHITECTURE

The complexity of stakeholder needs and the uncertainty of finding a model perfectly matching stakeholder-expected rankings within the Rashomon set necessitate a multi-head architecture.

For a single stakeholder group, we are motivated by the following lemma:

Lemma. For a given target ranking, there may exist multiple distinct rankings that have the same Spearman's rank correlation coefficient with the target ranking (proof see Appendix E).

When considering multiple stakeholder groups, the multi-head architecture becomes critical. This is motivated by an important observation:

Proposition. The increase in disagreement among stakeholders leads to greater opportunity to find a more faithful model (proof see Appendix E), shown as:

$$
\mathbb {P} \left(\exists M ^ {*} \in \mathcal {M}, \rho \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {M, \varphi}, \mathbf {r} ^ {j}\right) <   \rho \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {M ^ {*}, \varphi}, \mathbf {r} ^ {j}\right)\right) \propto \left(1 - \rho \left(\mathbf {r} ^ {i}, \mathbf {r} ^ {j}\right)\right), \tag {6}
$$

where  $1 - \rho(\mathbf{r}^i, \mathbf{r}^j)$  is the disagreement between two stakeholders  $i$  and  $j$  and  $i \neq j$ .

Consequently, we integrate multiple heads into the architecture, each corresponding to a potential solution. By integrating the above components  $f_{dman}$  and  $f_{diffsort}$  into the architecture, our objective function is reformulated to minimize negative ranking correlation across all heads in an MHMN:

$$
\underset {\Theta} {\min } \mathcal {L} _ {r a n k} = \underset {\Theta} {\min } \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {h} \underset {M _ {j} \in \mathcal {M}} {\min } - \rho (\mathbf {r} ^ {M _ {j}, \varphi}, \mathbf {r} ^ {*}),
$$

where  $\Theta$  represents the set of parameters for all  $h$  heads and  $\mathbf{r}^*$  is the target ranking.

# 3.2.2 Attribution Direction, SPARSE AND DIVERSE CONSTRAINTS

To ensure that our multi-head architecture produces meaningful and diverse solutions while respecting stakeholder input, we introduce several key constraints:

Attribution Direction  $(\mathcal{L}_{sign})$ : We recognize the importance of maintaining the direction of feature attributions as specified by stakeholders. To achieve this, we incorporate a sign loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {s i g n}} = \mathcal {L} _ {\text {M S E}} (\text {s i g n} (\mathbf {a} ^ {M, \varphi}), \text {s i g n} (\mathbf {a} _ {\text {t r u e}} ^ {*}))
$$

This loss term ensures that the sign of the attributions in our identified models aligns with the stakeholder-specified directions, when  $\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{true}}^*$  provided as ground truth attributions. The corresponding target ranking is derived as  $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{true}}^* = f_{diffsort}(|\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{true}}^*|)$ .

Sparsity Constraint  $(\mathcal{L}_{sparsity})$  and Diversity Constraint  $(\mathcal{L}_{diversity})$ : To encourage both variation across masks and within each mask, we implement sparsity and diversity losses. These constraints aid in uncovering diverse explanations that are consistent with stakeholder expectations while providing a range of potential interpretations.

The overall objective for a stakeholder group, incorporating these constraints, is formulated as:

$$
\min  _ {\Theta} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {\text {r a n k}} + \mathcal {L} _ {\text {s i g n}} + \lambda_ {1} \mathcal {L} _ {\text {s p a r s i t y}} + \lambda_ {2} \mathcal {L} _ {\text {d i v e r s i t y}}\right), \tag {7}
$$

where  $\lambda_{1}$  and  $\lambda_{2}$  are hyperparameters that control the weight of the sparsity and diversity losses. By propagating the error backward through the surrogate network and the sorting network, we can train the multi-head network. The algorithm is provided as pseudocode in the Appendix Algorithm 1.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

Our experimental framework was applied to six datasets provided by OpenXAI (Agarwal et al., 2022), including both synthetic and empirical datasets, information summarized in the Appendix F Table 3. We utilized two pre-trained models from OpenXAI API for benchmarking: a logistic regressor (LR), an artificial neural network (ANN), and an interpretable decision tree (DT) for a more comprehensive comparison. The experimental design is structured to gain new insights into explanation disagreements and demonstrate how EXAGREE improves explanation agreements.

Experimental Setup To establish a consistent benchmark for stakeholder needs, we adopted the ground truth explanations derived from the pre-trained LR as our constant target ranking. This approach allows for systematic evaluation of explanation agreement across diverse scenarios, explanation methods, and models. OpenXAI built-in explanation methods (Agarwal et al., 2022) and Feature Importance Score (FIS) (Li et al., 2024) are used as feature attributions for pre-trained LR and ANN models. To quantify the agreement between various explanations and this established ground truth, we compared their feature importance rankings using the comprehensive set of evaluation metrics detailed in Sec. 2.3.

# 4.1 EXISTENCE OF EXPLANATION DISAGREEMENT PROBLEMS AND BEYOND

Explanation disagreement problems have been discussed and evidenced in previous studies Krishna et al. (2022); Li & Barnard (2024). Our aim here is not to reiterate these discussions, but to concisely formalize these problems within the context. To this end, we conducted a series of targeted

experiments across various models, explanation methods, and datasets, designed to illustrate these fundamental explanation disagreements.

Model Disagreement We compared explanation agreements among the LR, ANN, and DT models for the same stakeholder needs, showing how explanation agreements can vary across different model architectures despite promising performance in Table 1, Table 2, and other Tables in the Appendix.

Explanation Method Disagreement We applied various explanation methods provided in OpenXAI (e.g., LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients), including common permutation-based and gradient-based methods, to the same model and stakeholder needs. The results highlight substantial variability in explanations across these different methods in Table 1, Table 2, and other Tables in the Appendix. It is also noted that well-established methods, such as SHAP might result in substantial disagreement.

Ground Truth Disagreement We compared intrinsic interpretations from DT, post-hoc explanations from both interpretable and black-box models (LR, ANN) against the assumed ground truth (LR coefficients), demonstrating disagreements among various metrics, shown in Table 1, Table 2, and other Tables in the Appendix.

# 4.1.1 NOTEWORTHY INSIGHTS INTO THE EXPLANATION DISAGREEMENT PROBLEMS

Trends across Models, Explanation Methods, and Datasets Our analysis reveals a trend: when stakeholder needs to align with the ground truth attribution of an interpretable model (LR in this case), explanation agreement (explaining LR itself) is generally high. This is evident in the LR results in Tables 1 and 2, where LIME and gradient-based methods show consistently high scores across FA, RA, RC, and PRA metrics. In contrast, when explaining models other than the ground truth model itself, regardless of their interpretability (e.g., ANN as a black-box model or DT as an interpretable model), explanation agreement often varies significantly across different datasets. For instance, DT shows perfect FA (1.0) in Adult Income but 0.6 in the Synthetic dataset (Tables 1 and 2).

From a broader perspective, explanation agreements derived from the ground truth model (LR) generally outperform those from black-box models (e.g., ANN) across most datasets. However, exceptions are observed in the COMPAS and GMSC datasets, where agreement levels between LR and black-box models are similar. This suggests that in these cases, the black-box models may coincidentally similarly make predictions as the ground truth model.

Some explanation methods exhibit better agreement in black-box models than the ground truth model. For instance, SHAP demonstrates higher agreement when explaining the ANN model, despite showing lower agreement with the LR model in Table 1. These observations highlight the complex

nature of explanations and the challenges in finding a single model or explanation method that universally outperforms others, leading to the following discussion.

The Significance of Stakeholder Disagreement If we conceptualize different explanation methods (e.g., Random, LIME, and SHAP) as representing distinct stakeholder perspectives, stakeholder disagreements emerge from a single model (e.g., LR or ANN). Assuming LR coefficients as ground truth explanations, we might find that one stakeholder (represented by  $s_{\mathrm{LIME}}$ ) is satisfied, while another (represented by  $s_{\mathrm{SHAP}}$ ) is not. In such scenarios, we observe that greater disagreement between these "stakeholders" in one model (LR) can lead to potentially improved faithfulness for  $s_{\mathrm{SHAP}}$  in another model (ANN). In other words,  $s_{\mathrm{SHAP}}$  shows higher satisfaction with ANN than with LR. This observation reveals a crucial insight: when stakeholder requirements are diverse, relying on a single model often yields conflicting explanations, demonstrating stakeholder disagreement. It also underscores the potential existence of more faithful models capable of addressing previously unsatisfied stakeholder needs, showing the validity of Proposition in Sec. 3.2.1.

# 4.2 ENHANCING EXPLANATION AGREEMENT THROUGH EXAGREE

We now turn to demonstrate the efficacy of our EXAGREE framework in identifying models that enhance explanation agreement from the Rashomon set, with a focus on improving both faithfulness and fairness. EXAGREE was evaluated across six datasets, with the results partially presented in Tables 1 and 2, Figs. 3 and 4, as well as in additional tables and figures in the Appendix. An ablation study demonstrating the impact of  $\epsilon$  on the Rashomon set, and consequently on explanation agreements, is presented in the Appendix G Fig. 7.

Faithfulness Analysis The agreement metrics for the given models and the identified SAEMs are reported in Tables 1 and 2 for  $k = 0.25$ . This comparison allows us to evaluate SAEMs against other established explanation methods across the LR and ANN models. While the identified SAEMs do not always outperform other methods (e.g., LIME in the HELOC dataset in Table 9), they demonstrate superior agreement in most datasets compared with established explanation methods (e.g., SHAP).

Figure 4: Comparison of fairness analysis between the LR model (top) and SAEM (bottom) for  $k = 0.25$  on the Adult Income, COMPAS, and German Credit datasets. Faithfulness metrics are shown for majority (male, red) and minority (female, blue) subgroups. Larger gaps between subgroup values indicate higher, undesirable disparities.

More significantly, SAEMs consistently enhance explanation agreement relative to the provided models (assumed as black-box to stakeholders). This improvement is demonstrated through the visualizations of agreement metrics (FA, RA, SA, and SRA) across different  $k$  values in Fig. 3.

Fairness in Subgroups Our fairness analysis, depicted in Fig. 4, compares the faithfulness between the pre-trained LR and the identified SAEM on three datasets that contain gender information (e.g., male and female). The provided model exhibits significant disparities in faithfulness metrics between majority and minority groups, indicating unfair explanations, particularly in the Adult Income dataset (see Fig. 4 (a)). The SAEMs identified by our framework reduce these inequities across all three datasets, showcasing an improvement in explanation fairness between subgroups.

The Significance of Stakeholder-Centered Perspective The significance of our framework goes beyond the performance metrics. By conceptualizing the LR ground truth explanations as a universal benchmark provided to all stakeholders and treating each method and model as distinct stakeholder perspectives (e.g.,  $s_{\mathrm{LR}}$ ,  $s_{\mathrm{ANN}}$ ), we identify significant disagreements among stakeholders. The EXAGREE framework effectively enhances explanation agreement for both  $s_{\mathrm{LR}}$  and  $s_{\mathrm{ANN}}$ , providing more fair and faithful explanations to the unique requirements of each stakeholder group.

User-friendly Interface The EXAGREE framework ultimately serves as a practical tool for diverse stakeholders. Therefore, we incorporate user-friendly functionality that bridges complex technical implementations and stakeholder needs by leveraging advancements in recent Large Language Models. EXAGREE the Gemini API (Google, 2023) to convert stakeholders' needs to attributions or rankings, allowing stakeholders to articulate preferences and domain knowledge without extensive machine learning expertise. We showcase a user case in the Appendix C Fig. 5.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this work, we formalized the ranking-based explanation disagreement problem and advocated for a stakeholder-centered perspective that aims to meet specific needs. This approach lays a foundation for future studies in the field of explainable machine learning. To reconcile the complex challenge of explanation disagreement, we introduced EXAGREE, a novel framework that identifies SAEMs. By leveraging the Rashomon set concept, EXAGREE enhances both the faithfulness and fairness of model explanations, as demonstrated through rigorous experiments across various datasets. The dual improvement achieved by EXAGREE not only provides a practical solution adaptable to diverse stakeholder requirements but also effectively addresses subgroup fairness. This underscores the framework's potential to contribute to a more trustworthy and interpretable AI system in high-stakes decision-making contexts. Broader impact and limitations are discussed in the Appendix A.
