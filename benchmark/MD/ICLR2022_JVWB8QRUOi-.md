# ABSTRACT

Promoting cooperation among self-interested agents is a long-standing and interdisciplinary problem, but receives less attention in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Game-theoretical studies reveal that altruistic incentives are critical to the emergence of cooperation but their analyses are limited to non-sequential social dilemmas. Recent works using deep MARL also show that learning to incentivize other agents has the potential to promote cooperation in more realistic sequential social dilemmas (SSDs). However, we find that, with incentivizing mechanisms, the team cooperation level does not converge and regularly oscillates between cooperation and defection during learning. We show that a second-order social dilemma resulting from the incentive mechanisms is the main reason for such fragile cooperation. We analyze the dynamics of second-order social dilemmas and find that a typical tendency of humans, called homophily, provides a promising solution. We propose a novel learning framework to encourage homophilic incentives and show that it achieves stable cooperation in both SSDs of public goods and tragedy of the commons.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved prominent progress (Sunehag et al., 2018; Rashid et al., 2018; Baker et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). While much effort is devoted to fully cooperative settings, decision-making individuals in many real-world situations may be self-interested, such as autonomous vehicles (Bonnefon et al., 2016), taxpayers (Rothstein, 2001), and governments dealing with climate change (Capstick, 2013). A unique phenomenon among self-interested agents is social dilemma, in which individually rational behavior results in a situation where everyone suffers in the long run. Historically, the problem of how cooperation emerges in social dilemmas has long perplexed scientists from various fields, such as evolutionary biology, animal behavioristics (Packer et al., 1991), and neuroscience (Rilling et al., 2002), and is listed as one of the 125 most compelling science questions for the 21st century (Kennedy, 2005; Pennisi, 2005).

Cooperation emergence in non-sequential social dilemmas (SDs) have been extensively studied (Boyd, 1989; Rand & Nowak, 2011). However, these methods only consider the problems that can be cast as a matrix game (Hughes et al., 2018), and typically assume the existence of atomic actions for cooperative and defective strategies. Thus their applicability to real-world, temporally extended SDs is limited, where cooperation and defection are policies that need to be learned. With the ability to learn policies in complex tasks, deep MARL shows promise to fill the gap and study how cooperation emerges in these more realistic sequential social dilemmas (SSDs) (Leibo et al., 2017).

Some previous works have studied SSDs from the perspective of MARL (Jaques et al., 2019; Hughes et al., 2018). Among them, Yang et al. (2020) and Lupu & Precup (2020) extend (altruistic) incentives to temporally extended cases. Referring to individuals paying costs to punish or reward others even though there is no immediate gain by these actions for themselves (Ostrom et al., 1992; Guth, 1995; Fehr & Gächter, 2002; Boyd et al., 2003; Mussweiler & Ockenfels, 2013), altruistic incentives have been proven to be highly related to cooperation emergence in non-sequential SSDs (Fowler, 2005; Akçay & Roughgarden, 2011; Fong & Surti, 2009). However, altruistic incentives have not been fully studied in SSDs. The aforementioned deep methods do not effectively scale up and are limited in very small settings. With further investigation, we find that these methods do not converge to stable cooperation, where the cooperation level regularly oscillates between cooperation and defection.

In this paper, we first analyze the underlying reasons behind the phenomenon of such unstable cooperation. We find that, although incentives make cooperation more likely to emerge, they also introduce a second-order social dilemma (2nd-SDs) problem into the system – if someone else would pay costs to punish or reward others, why should I bother to do so (Dreber et al., 2008)? The consequence is that more and more second-order free-riders would exploit those agents who make an effort to incentivize others, resulting in a degraded incentivizing mechanism and thus collapsed cooperation. 2nd-SDs have been well studied in non-sequential social dilemmas (Fowler, 2005; Greenwood, 2016). However, solving 2nd-SDs in sequential settings remains largely untouched in the literature and posts new challenges – the identification of cooperation and defection for incentivizing is non-trivial in SSDs and cooperation is more vulnerable to 2nd-SDs in SSDs than in SDs. Thus SSDs require a different computational approach to promote cooperation. Specifically, in SSDs, agents need to learn temporally extended strategies which are much more complex than simple cooperation and defection action in SDs and can be dynamically mixed with cooperation and defection behaviors, especially during the learning. The agents that have successfully learned cooperative incentivizing policies can be exploited by other agents with temporarily learned mixing strategies, and the exploited cooperators may abandon cooperative strategies, making it less likely for other agents to learn to cooperate. This issue does not exist in SDs but will severely hinder cooperation emergence in SSDs.

To solve this problem, we first illustrate the dynamics of and formally analyze the impetus for the second-order social dilemma on a fully-featured motivating example. Based on these analyses, we propose a novel learning mechanism by encouraging agents with similar environmental behaviors to have similar incentivizing behaviors. Our method is inspired by a concept called homophily, a particularly common tendency for human individuals to associate or bound with similar others, as in the proverb birds of a feather flock together. In the literature, homophily has been studied in non-sequential social dilemmas, where agents interact with others of similar predefined types (Fu et al., 2012; Fletcher & Doebeli, 2009; Ramazi et al., 2016). In non-sequential cases, agents can choose their partners to interact with (Rand et al., 2011; Aksoy, 2015) or there is a matching system that auto-matches similar agents (Bergstrom, 2003; Bilancini et al., 2016), but it is not clear how to extend these insights to SSDs. Our work solves this problem and enables a group of self-interested agents to cooperate stably when they are continually learning and acting in a shared environment.

It is worth noting that multi-person social dilemmas are classified into two broad categories: public goods and the tragedy of the commons (HARDIN, 1968; Kollock, 1998; Ledyard, 1994; Hardin, 2009). We evaluate our method on both of these sequential social dilemmas and show that the agent population learns stable cooperative behaviors with great efficiency and stability. Visualization of the evolution process of cooperation shows that homophily effectively enables stable cooperation by preventing agents that conduct altruistic incentives from being exploited by second-order free-riders.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES AND RELATED WORKS

Social dilemmas (SDs) are among the most important settings used to study the emergence of cooperation. In a social dilemma, there exists a tension between the individual and collective rationality, in which individually rational behavior results in a situation where everyone suffers in the long run. Although studies on SDs have contributed significantly to the research of cooperation emergence for decades (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1987; Peysakhovich & Lerer, 2017; Anastassacos et al., 2020), they focus on fixed policies, where the cooperative and defective strategies are actions to be chosen rather than policies to be learned. To be more realistic as in real-world situations, in this paper, we consider sequential social dilemmas (SSDs, (Leibo et al., 2017; Blanco et al., 2014)).

An SSD can be modelled as a partially-observable general-sum Markov game (Littman, 1994)  $\mathcal{M} = \langle I,S,\{A_i\},P,O,\{\Omega_i\},\{R_i\},n,\gamma \rangle$  , where  $I$  is a finite set of  $n$  agents and  $\gamma$  is a discount factor. At each time step, agent  $i$  draws a partial observation  $o_{i}\in \Omega_{i}$  of the state  $s\in S$  according to the observation function  $O(s,i)$  . Based on the observation, agent  $i$  selects an action  $a_{i}\in A_{i}$  , which together form a joint action  $\pmb{a}$  , leading to a next state  $s^\prime$  according to the stochastic transition function  $P(s^{\prime}|s,a)$  and individual rewards  $r_i = R_i(s,a)$  for each agent. In SSDs, instead of taking atomic cooperation or defection actions, agents must learn cooperation or defection strategies consisting of potentially long sequences of environmental actions. The goal of each agent is to maximize the local expected return:  $Q_{i}(s,\pmb {a}) = \mathbb{E}_{s_0:\infty ,\pmb{a}_{0:\infty}}[\sum_{t = 0}^{\infty}\gamma^{t}R_{i}(s_{t},\pmb{a}_{t})|s_{0} = s,\pmb{a}_{0} = \pmb {a}]$

Altruistic incentive, including altruistically rewarding and punishing others, is known as one of the solutions for social dilemmas (Kollock, 1998). However, it introduces the problem of second-order social dilemma (2nd-SD), which arises from each individual's inclination to free ride on a mechanism that is designed to solve the first-order social dilemma. To solve 2nd-SDs, previous works either introduce additional mechanisms, such as extra punishing mechanisms (Fowler, 2005; Greenwood, 2016), reputation mechanisms (Panchanathan & Boyd, 2004), or change the game settings, such as enabling the amount of public goods to grow exponentially with the number of contributors (Ye et al., 2016), considering corruption and power asymmetries (Ubeda & Duenez-Guzman, 2011). These works analyze the dynamics of predefined and fixed mechanisms and focus on non-sequential games.

We propose to solve 2nd-SDs in general cases using the tendency of homophily, which states that agents tend to have similar incentivizing behaviors if their environmental behaviors are similar. In the literature, homophily, frequently termed as assortative matching (Bergstrom, 2003), is often referred to the tendency for agents to interact with others of similar types (Fu et al., 2012; Fletcher & Doebeli, 2009; Ramazi et al., 2016). These works assume that a game (such as Prisoner's Dilemma and Public Goods Dilemma) involves only a group of several agents from a large population. Based on the way they form the group, these works can be divided into two broad categories. (1) Agents can choose their partners to interact with (Rand et al., 2011; Aksoy, 2015). However, in SSDs, agents do not have such an option and their partners are determined at initialization. They have to continually learn and act in a shared environment instead of a separate environment instance for each group. (2) There is a matching system that can auto-match agents with similar predefined types to join the game (Bergstrom, 2003; Bilancini et al., 2016). However, in SSDs, agents are assumed to have determined partners and thus the matching process changes the game settings. Moreover, the existence of such a matching system is an unrealistic assumption because the policy types (such as cooperation and defection) in SSDs cannot be predefined since temporally extended strategies are much more complex and can be dynamically mixed with cooperation and defection, especially during learning. Therefore, previous work studying homophily can not be applied to SSDs. Moreover, Wang et al. (2018) also find that assortative matching of environmental behaviors cannot promote cooperation in SSDs. In contrast, our work encourages homophily on the level of incentivizing behaviors, which we find outperforming other algorithms on learning cooperation in SSDs. Furthermore, we discuss how homophily relates to other possible solutions in Appendix B.7.

Recent works study some other mechanisms which may encourage cooperation in SSDs. Hughes et al. (2018) study the effects of inequality aversion, which bypasses the problem of second-order social dilemmas because the punishment does not incur costs to any agents other than the punished ones. Jaques et al. (2019) find that encouraging mutual influence among agents can promote collective behaviors. We empirically compare with these methods in Sec. 5.2.

In the following sections, we will first provide a motivating example to show the influence of SDs, 2nd-SDs, and how homophily can solve 2nd-SDs. Based on these analyses, we introduce how to encourage homophily in temporally extended cases in Sec. 4.

# 3 MOTIVATING EXAMPLE: FRAGILE COOPERATION

In this section, we provide a detailed motivating example to explain 1st- and 2nd-SDs in the context of RL, and demonstrate that homophily can promote cooperation by alleviating the 2nd-SDs. For clarity, in this section, we use one-step games to illustrate our idea, which inspires our extension to sequential settings in Sec. 4.

We adopt a classic problem setting of public goods dilemma (Hauert et al., 2007; 2002a; Semmann et al., 2003; Hauert et al., 2002b). A population of  $n$  agents has an opportunity to create a public good, from which all can benefit, regardless of whether they have contributed to the good. Specifically, there are three strategies (atomic actions). Contributors ( $C$ ) pay a cost  $c$  to increase the size of public good by  $b$ . Defectors ( $D$ ) do not contribute. The public good is uniformly distributed among cooperators and defectors. Agents can also choose to neither contribute to nor benefit from the public good, but receive a fixed reward  $\sigma$ , as Nonparticipants ( $N$ ). For clarity, we conduct analyses using an illustrative example with  $n = 10$ ,  $b = 3$ ,  $c = 1$ ,  $\sigma = 1$ . We also provide a sensitivity analysis regarding parameters in Appendix B.3 to consolidate that our conclusion generally holds.

A: Cooperation is fragile in 1st-SDs. We first showcase the influence of 1st-SDs. The Schelling diagram (Schelling, 1973; Perolat et al., 2017) (Fig. 1(a)) proves the existence of SDs in this case. To visualize the learning dynamics of MARL algorithms under 1st-SDs, we learn independent policies for agents using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992). In Fig. 1(b), we plot the change of the proportion of cooperative agents in the population under 3 random seeds. We observe that the cooperation level oscillates during learning. For explanation, we visualize the dynamics of population constituent in a ternary plot (Fig. 1(c)). Each point  $X$  inside the equilateral triangle represents a distribution of population members  $(p_{C}, p_{D}, p_{N})$ , where  $p_{C} + p_{D} + p_{N} = 1$ ,  $p_{C}, p_{D}, p_{N}$  are represented by the distances from point  $X$  to the edges  $ND$ ,  $CN$ , and  $CD$ , respectively. Trajectories in Fig. 1(c) correspond to the curves with the same color in Fig. 1(b). We can observe that all the trajectories rotate counterclockwise in the vicinity of vertex  $N$  regardless of the starting position.

Formally, we calculate the closed-form gradients of agents' true value functions and visualize the gradient field in Fig. 1(d). It can be observed that cooperation is not a stable solution, which can be easily taken over by defectors, and then by nonparticipants. This phenomenon is the result of 1st-SDs, where cooperation is exploited by defection, eventually leading the system to a very ineffective state. We refer readers to Appendix E for the detailed proof.

B: Unexploitable altruistic incentives make cooperation possible. To introduce altruistic incentives into the system, we add Punishers  $(P)$  as the fourth type of strategy. The same as contributors, a punisher contributes to and benefits from the public good, and importantly, it also pays a cost  $k$  to incur a punishment  $p$  on defectors. This punishment is altruistic because it reduces its own immediate reward but benefits the team in the long run. To show the effect of altruistic incentives, we need to guarantee that no agent can exploit altruistic incentives by being a pure contributor that does not pay cost to punish defectors. Therefore, we first consider the setting where punishers also pay a cost  $\alpha k$  to incur a punishment  $\alpha p$  on the pure contributors for not punishing defectors (Fowler, 2005). We denote this punishing type by  $PA$ , which represents a kind of unexploitable altruistic incentives.

For simplicity, we illustrate our analyses with  $p = 2$ ,  $k = 0.35$ ,  $\alpha = 1$  (sensitivity analysis is deferred to Appendix B.3). Each horizontal plane in Fig. 2(a) shows the Schelling diagram under the corresponding number of first-order defectors. Similar to Fig. 1(c), we visualize the dynamics of independent learners under this situation in Fig. 2(b) using a quaternary plot (refer to Appendix A.2 for more details). We see that although two trajectories are trapped in the  $C-D-N$  plane and similar to those in Fig. 1(c), one of the three trajectories finds the stable cooperation solution  $PA$ .

We plot the closed-form gradients in Fig. 3(a), where the green (blue) region indicates that a population initialized there would converge to cooperative (non-cooperative) solution. This figure proves that introducing unexploitable altruistic incentives creates a "safe region" near  $PA$ , and the populations initialized there converge to cooperative solutions.

C: Exploitable altruistic incentives suffer from 2nd-SDs, which again lead to fragile cooperation. Now we restrict the punishments incurred by punishers, and they can only pay a cost  $k$  to incur a punishment  $p$  on defectors. Now the punishers can be exploited by pure cooperators who do not pay for but benefit from punishments. We call this type of punishers the exploitable punishers. On each horizontal plane in Fig. 2(c), we show the Schelling diagram with different numbers of first-order defectors, which reveals the existence of second-order social dilemmas.

Formally, assume that the probability of agent  $i$  taking three actions are  $\theta^{i,C},\theta^{i,D},\theta^{i,P}$ , respectively. It can be derived (Appendix E) that the gradient of agent  $i$ 's value function w.r.t. the probability of second-order cooperative action  $\theta^{i,P}$  minus the gradient w.r.t the probability of second-order defective action  $\theta^{i,C}$  is  $-k\sum_{j\neq i}\theta^{j,D}$ , where  $k > 0$  is the punishment cost. The gradient is negative

for any  $\theta^{j,D}$ , which indicates that second-order cooperators would be taken over by second-order defectors. This is the second-order social dilemma. The result is that only strategies  $C, D, N$  exist, after which the system degrades due to the 1st-SD as discussed before. We plot the closed-form gradients in Fig. 2(d), from which we observe that the "safe region" disappears, and, for any initialization, the population ends with non-cooperation.

Takeaways We conclude that only unexploitable incentives can make cooperation a stable solution. It becomes particularly problematic in temporally extended cases, where the incentivizing policies need to be learned. It is typical that some agents would learn altruistic incentives earlier than others. However, as analysed before, these altruistic agents will be exploited by other agents, leading to degraded altruistic behaviors. Further, with collapsed altruistic incentivizing mechanisms, the population falls back to a 1st-SD, making cooperation much less likely to emerge.

D: Homophily solves second-order social dilemmas. To show the effect of homophily, based on the settings in part C, we further encourage agents with similar acting behaviors to have similar incentivizing behaviors. Since only contributors and punishers have the same acting behavior of contributing to the public good, we encourage their incentives to be the same by converting the minority of P and C to the majority with a probability of 0.2.

Figure 3: Homophily solves second-order social dilemmas.

We plot the closed-form gradient in Fig. 3(b). We find that the "safe region" reappears. The gradient w.r.t.

$\theta^{i,P}$  minus the gradient w.r.t  $\theta^{i,C}$  is  $-k\sum_{j\neq i}\theta^{j,D} + 2\lambda \mathrm{sign}(\sum_{j\neq i}(\theta^{j,P} - \theta^{j,C}))\min (\theta^{i,C},\theta^{j,P})$  which is positive when close to point P. Interestingly, the "safe region" is larger than that in Fig. 3(a). In this way, we conclude that homophily helps solve 2nd-SDs.

By this motivating example, we show that homophilic incentives encourage cooperation. However, this study focuses on one-step games and predefines the mechanism of punishers. The question is how to encourage homophily in realistic settings without depending on any predefined mechanisms.

# 4 METHODS

As discussed in the previous section, 2nd-SDs disturb the learning process of incentivizing actions – agents who learn altruistic incentives earlier tend to be exploited by other agents. Consequently, the altruistic incentivizing behaviors are typically taken over and the population would fall back to 1st-SDs, resulting in a hopeless loop.

In this section, we discuss how to introduce homophily into sequential social dilemmas so that the loop can be broken and cooperation is possible to emerge and stabilize. We propose to encourage homophily by encouraging agents with similar acting (environmental) behaviors to have similar incentivizing behaviors. We now describe our learning framework shown in Fig. 4.

# 4.1 INCENTIVIZING AND ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR LEARNING

To enable incentivizing behaviors, we add incentivizing actions to the action space. We use  $a_{i\rightarrow j}$  to denote the incentivizing action from  $i$  to  $j$ . The action  $a_{i\rightarrow j}$  induces an inter-agent reward  $\eta^{e}r_{i\rightarrow j}$

to agent  $j$ . Here,  $\eta^e > 0$  is a scaling factor. In this paper, we consider three types of incentivizing actions with a positive, negative, and zero  $r_{i \rightarrow j}$ , respectively. Since we consider altruistic incentives, the action  $a_{i \rightarrow j}$  itself costs  $\eta^c | r_{i \rightarrow j}|$ , where  $\eta^c > 0$  is also a scaling factor.

Each agent learns two Q functions, for selecting environmental actions and incentivizing actions, respectively. At each step, agents first simultaneously select environmental actions  $a_{i}$  according to  $Q_{\theta_i}^{i,\mathrm{env}}(\tau_i,a_i)$ , which is based on local action-observation history and is parameterized by  $\theta_{i}$ . Then, conditioned on environmental actions of other agents,  $\pmb{a}_{-i}$ , each agent  $i$  decides its incentivizing actions  $\pmb{a}_{i\rightarrow -i}$  according to  $Q_{\phi_i}^{i,\mathrm{inc}}((\tau_i,\pmb{a}_{-i}),\pmb{a}_{i\rightarrow -i})$  parameterized by  $\phi_{i}$ .

One question is what rewards should be considered when training  $Q_{\phi_i}^{i,\mathrm{inc}}$ . Intuitively, incentivizing actions are expected to positively influence the return given by the environment. Therefore, we include environment rewards  $r_i$ . We also consider the costs of incentivizing actions to prevent agents from excessively giving incentives. Moreover, we ignore the

![](images/5951c90fe14075d67a0ecf90cad790daa5f00f01612695d52907b47712e4cfe7.jpg)  
Figure 4: Homophily learning framework.

rewards received from other agents, which can effectively prevent agents from learning trivial and detrimental policies, such as keeping exchanging positive incentives regardless of the observations.

Another question of learning  $Q_{\phi_i}^{i,\mathrm{inc}}$  is that it requires  $3^{n - 1}$  outputs using a conventional deep Q-network and most output heads would remain unchanged for long stretches of time. To solve this problem, agent  $i$  can learn  $n - 1$  incentivizing Q functions  $\bar{Q}_{\phi_i}^{i,\mathrm{inc}}$ , each of which corresponds to one agent  $j \neq i$ . However, this alternative arises a new question because the environment rewards are considered when training  $Q_{\phi_i}^{i,\mathrm{inc}}$  but they do not present an explicit decomposition over agents. To solve this problem, we propose to estimate  $Q_{\phi_i}^{i,\mathrm{inc}}$  as a summation:

$$
Q _ {\phi_ {i}} ^ {i, \text {i n c}} \left(\left(\tau_ {i}, \boldsymbol {a} _ {- i}\right), \boldsymbol {a} _ {i \rightarrow - i}\right) = \sum_ {j \neq i} \bar {Q} _ {\phi_ {i}} ^ {i, \text {i n c}} \left(\left(\tau_ {i}, a _ {j}\right), a _ {i \rightarrow j}\right). \tag {1}
$$

Here, parameters of  $\bar{Q}_{\phi_i}^{i,\mathrm{inc}}$  are shared to accelerate training. This formulation is similar to VDN (Sunehag et al., 2018), but we sum incentivizing Q's of a single agent, rather than Q's of different agents.

With these formulations, we train each agent's incentivizing Q by minimizing the following TD loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {i} ^ {\text {i n c}} \left(\phi_ {i}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {D}} \left[\left(r _ {i} - \eta^ {c} \sum_ {j \neq i} \left| r _ {i \rightarrow j} \right| + \gamma^ {\text {i n c}} \max  _ {\boldsymbol {a} _ {i \rightarrow - i} ^ {\prime}} Q _ {\phi_ {i} ^ {-}} ^ {i, \text {i n c}} \left(\left(\tau_ {i} ^ {\prime}, \boldsymbol {a} _ {- i} ^ {\prime}\right), \boldsymbol {a} _ {i \rightarrow - i} ^ {\prime}\right) - Q _ {\phi_ {i}} ^ {i, \text {i n c}} \left(\left(\tau_ {i}, \boldsymbol {a} _ {- i}\right), \boldsymbol {a} _ {i \rightarrow - i}\right)\right) ^ {2} \right], \tag {2}
$$

where  $\gamma^{\mathrm{inc}}$  is the discount factor,  $\phi_i^{-}$  is parameters of a target network that are periodically copied from  $\phi_{i}$ , and the expectation is estimated by uniform samples from a replay buffer  $\mathcal{D}$ .

Environmental Q function is trained with rewards from the environment and the incentives received from other agents, and we minimize the following TD loss for learning  $Q^{i,\mathrm{env}}$ :

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {i} ^ {\text {e n v}} \left(\theta_ {i}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {D}} \left[ \left(y _ {i} ^ {\text {e n v}} - Q _ {\theta_ {i}} ^ {i, \text {e n v}} \left(\tau_ {i}, a _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {2} \right]. \tag {3}
$$

Here, the expectation is estimated with uniform samples from the replay buffer  $\mathcal{D}$ ,  $y_{i}^{\mathrm{env}} = r_{i} + \eta^{\mathrm{e}}\sum_{j\neq i}r_{j\rightarrow i} + \gamma^{\mathrm{env}}\max_{a_i'}Q_{\theta_i^-}^{i,\mathrm{env}}(\tau_i',a_i')$  is the target for environmental Q-learning.  $\theta_{i}^{-}$  is parameters of a target network that are periodically copied from  $\theta_{i}$ .

# 4.2 HOMOPHILY

Directly learning incentivizing policies can be difficult due to second-order social dilemmas as we discussed in Sec. 3. To solve this problem and inspired by the stateless case in Sec. 3 Part D, we encourage agents to be homophilic, i.e., agents with similar environmental behaviors should have

Figure 5: Comparison of our method against baselines and ablations.

similar incentive behaviors, which can be expressed as a loss to be minimized:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {i} ^ {\mathrm {h o m o}} \left(\phi_ {i}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {D}} \left[ - \sum_ {j \neq i} S ^ {\mathrm {e n v}} (i, j) S ^ {\mathrm {i n c}} (i, j; \phi_ {i}) \right], \tag {4}
$$

where  $S^{\mathrm{env}}$  is 1 or 0, indicating the environmental behaviors are similar or not.  $S^{\mathrm{inc}}$  measures the similarity between incentivizing behaviors of two agents.

The first question is how to define  $\mathcal{S}^{\mathrm{inc}}(i,j;\phi_i)$ . The idea is to measure the similarity between two agents' incentive behaviors by comparing their incentive actions to each of other agents. For each agent  $i$ , we measure its similarity to agent  $j$  as:

$$
\mathcal {S} ^ {\mathrm {i n c}} (i, j; \phi_ {i}) = - \sum_ {k \notin \{i, j \}} \mathcal {C E} \left[ P _ {a _ {j \rightarrow k}} \| \sigma \left(\bar {Q} _ {\phi_ {i}} ^ {i, \mathrm {i n c}} \left(\left(\tau_ {i}, a _ {k}\right), \cdot\right)\right)\right], \tag {5}
$$

where  $\sigma (\cdot)$  is the softmax function,  $P_{a_{j\rightarrow k}}$  is a categorical distribution over agent  $j$ 's incentive actions, with a probability of 1 for the action that agent  $j$  takes for agent  $k$  ( $a_{j\rightarrow k}$ ). The cross entropy  $\mathcal{CE}[\cdot ||\cdot ]$  measures the distance between these two distributions.

As for  $S^{\mathrm{env}}$ , if we parameterize and learn it with  $S^{\mathrm{inc}}$  using  $\mathcal{L}_i^{\mathrm{homo}}$ , we may get trivial solutions. For example,  $S^{\mathrm{env}}$  may be a constant 1, in which case  $\mathcal{L}_i^{\mathrm{homo}}$  is minimized given the same  $S^{\mathrm{inc}}$ . To avoid such solutions, we propose to use non-parametric  $S^{\mathrm{env}}$ . Details are discussed in Appendix C.

With these components, the loss for agent  $i$  to learn environmental and incentivizing behaviors is:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {i} \left(\theta_ {i}, \phi_ {i}\right) = \mathcal {L} _ {i} ^ {\text {e n v}} \left(\theta_ {i}\right) + \lambda^ {\text {i n c}} \mathcal {L} _ {i} ^ {\text {i n c}} \left(\phi_ {i}\right) + \lambda^ {\text {h o m o}} \mathcal {L} _ {i} ^ {\text {h o m o}} \left(\phi_ {i}\right), \tag {6}
$$

where  $\lambda^{\mathrm{inc}}$  and  $\lambda^{\mathrm{homo}}$  are scaling factors. Agents learn their policies independently.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

Our experiments aim to answer the following questions: (1) Can homophily promote the emergence of cooperation? (Sec. 5.2) (2) What is the contribution of each component in the proposed learning framework? (Sec. 5.3) (3) How does cooperation emerge and evolve under homophilic incentives? (Sec. 5.4) (4) How does homophily affect incentive behaviors? (Sec. 5.5)

# 5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

We test our method in SSDs. There are two broad categories of multi-person social dilemmas (Kollock, 1998): Public goods dilemmas and Tragedy of commons dilemmas. In this paper, we consider sequential versions of these two dilemmas, Cleanup and Harvest (Leibo et al., 2017). In our learning framework, each agent has an environmental and an incentivizing Q function. The Q network architecture is the same for all agents but they do not share parameters. For other details of environments and our method, we refer readers to Appendix C.

# 5.2 PERFORMANCE

To test whether homophilic learning can promote the emergence of cooperation, we test our method on Cleanup and Harvest with different numbers of agents and compare against various baselines: LIO (Yang et al., 2020), Inequity Aversion (Hughes et al., 2018), Social Influence (Jaques et al., 2019), and Selfish Actor-Critic. The details of baselines can be found in Appendix D.

We test all methods with 5 random seeds and show the mean value as well as  $95\%$  confidence intervals in Fig. 5. It can be observed that our method helps agents learn cooperation with efficiency and

stability. In comparison, baseline algorithms either cannot learn any cooperation strategies or the cooperation level oscillates. Inequity aversion oscillates on Cancellation  $(n = 5)$ , which can be proved by its large confidence intervals, and cannot learn to cooperate on Harvest  $(n = 10)$ . Social influence proves that cooperation can be achieved by encouraging agents to influence each other, but it requires many samples (typically 100M as reported in Jaques et al. (2019)) to learn cooperative strategies. In contrast, our method needs around 5M samples to learn stable cooperative strategies. LIO can learn cooperation on Cancellation  $(n = 3)$ , but is less effective in dilemmas with more agents.

# 5.3 ABLATION STUDY

There are three contributions that characterize our method. (1) First and the most important, the homophily learning objective. (2) Discrete incentive actions and factored incentive Q-functions for each agent. (3) Excluding received incentives when training incentive Q-functions. In this section, we design the following ablations to test the contribution of each of these components.

(1) Without homophily (w/o homophily). We exclude the homophily loss  $\mathcal{L}_i^{\mathrm{homo}}$  from our learning objective. We can see that the team performance drops significantly, especially in tasks with more agents. Moreover, without homophily loss, our method performs worse than all baselines on Cleanup  $(n = 5)$  and  $(n = 10)$ . These observations suggest that our method works mainly because of the homophily loss. (2) Continuous incentivizing actions. Ablation Cont. inc. actions shows the influence of discrete actions. We learn a continuous incentivizing rewarding function for w/o homophily. We can observe further performance decrease on Cleanup  $(n = 3)$  and Harvest  $(n = 10)$ . We hypothesize that this is because the search space for incentivizing policies grows, making the strategy more difficult to learn. (3) Train incentivizing Q's with received incentives. We ignore incentives received by agents when training incentivizing strategies. For comparison, ablation w/ inc. shows what would happen if they are included. We can observe that w/ inc. significantly underperforms the original method on all environments. The reason is that agents learn to give each other positive incentives excessively regardless of observations. Since received incentives are also considered in Q-learning for acting behaviors, excessive incentives would overwhelm environmental rewards and significantly hurt learning performance.

# 5.4 EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION

To clearly show the evolution of emergent cooperation, the problem of 2nd-SDs, and how homophily alleviates this problem, according to different team returns, we select four stages during learning and analyze their corresponding behaviors. The detailed stage partition can be found in Fig. 6.

Phase 1: Exploring incentives. During this stage, agents are learning basic dynamics of the environment. For example, as shown in the first row of Fig. 6, agents have not learned to eat apples to get rewarded. Meanwhile, during exploration, agents occasionally give incentives to agents who cleaned wastes  $(t_{1} + 3)$ , which enables learning incentivizing behaviors in the following stages.

Phase 2: Second-order social dilemmas. Some agents (the pink agent in the second row of Fig. 6) learn to give positive rewards to cleaning agents altruistically. However, other agents (e.g., orange and blue) typically do not give positive incentives but can enjoy the benefits of others' altruistic behaviors. We can observe an oscillation of team return during this stage. This is the effect of 2nd-SDs. If there are no additional restrictions (such as homophily) to deal with this problem, the team will fall back to the state where no one wants to perform incentives, resulting in the collapse of cooperation.

Phase 3: Homophily solves 2nd-SDs. After some oscillations of cooperation, the homophily loss gradually encourages agents with similar environmental behaviors to have similar incentivizing behaviors. As shown in the third row of Fig. 6, although there are still some noisy incentives at this stage, agents who are close to the apple-spawning region simultaneously reward cleaning agents and punish those who are next to the wastes but do not clean them. These incentivizing behaviors indicate that the population has gotten over the 2nd-SD with the help of homophily. Correspondingly, the team return increases in this stage.

Phase 4: Stabilized cooperation. Taking advantage of the effect of homophily, during this stage, there are no second-order free-riders and all incentive rewards are given by agents harvesting apples to agents in the region of wastes. Moreover, screenshots show that agents learn an efficient division of labor – three agents eat apples and get environmental rewards while two agents clean the wastes and get rewards from harvesting agents. These incentivizing and environmental behaviors are a stable solution only when homophily learning objective is included.

Based on the illustrations of the evolution of cooperation, we conclude that homophily prevents altruistic incentivizing behaviors from being exploited by second-order free riders, and thus solves the problem of 2nd-SDs and leads to stable cooperation. For detailed agent behaviors at different stages, we refer readers to our online videos<sup>1</sup>.

# 5.5 HOMOPHILIC INCENTIVES

In previous sections, we show that homophilic incentives can promote cooperation, but how homophily affects incentivizing behaviors remains largely unclear. To make up for this, we compare our method with the ablation  $w / o$  homophily on Cleanup ( $n = 3$ ) by plotting their collective return and altruistic incentive (the average incentive that each Cleaner receives at each time step) in Fig. 7.

We can observe a close connection between incentives and cooperation performance. Intuitively, the more positive incentives cleaners receive, the more apples are expected to spawn and be collected. However, without homophily, the received incentives oscillate dramatically, which is caused by second-order social dilemmas and is in line with the discussions before. In

![](images/49c4094542da92732df3f91295753c37487413ab9f54a424dbd8e51358f36d9d.jpg)

comparison, our method keeps incentivizing cleaners and thus learn cooperation with stability.

# 6 CLOSING REMARKS

In this paper, we study the problem of cooperation emergence. We show that altruistic incentives make cooperation possible but cannot stabilize due to second-order social dilemmas. We then formally and empirically show that homophily, a common tendency typical of humans, may solve this problem. Combined with deep MARL, we propose an implementation of homophilic learning for sequential social dilemmas. We expect that our work can encourage future works on studying the exciting topics of cooperation emergence, evolution, and stability.
