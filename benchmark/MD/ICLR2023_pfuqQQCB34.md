# ABSTRACT

Byzantine-robustness has been gaining a lot of attention due to the growth of the interest in collaborative and federated learning. However, many fruitful directions, such as the usage of variance reduction for achieving robustness and communication compression for reducing communication costs, remain weakly explored in the field. This work addresses this gap and proposes Byz-VR-MARINA-a new Byzantine-tolerant method with variance reduction and compression. A key message of our paper is that variance reduction is key to fighting Byzantine workers more effectively. At the same time, communication compression is a bonus that makes the process more communication efficient. We derive theoretical convergence guarantees for Byz-VR-MARINA outperforming previous state-of-the-art for general non-convex and Polyak-Łojasiewicz loss functions. Unlike the concurrent Byzantine-robust methods with variance reduction and/or compression, our complexity results are tight and do not rely on restrictive assumptions such as boundedness of the gradients or limited compression. Moreover, we provide the first analysis of a Byzantine-tolerant method supporting non-uniform sampling of stochastic gradients. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Distributed optimization algorithms play a vital role in the training of the modern machine learning models. In particular, some tasks require training of deep neural networks having billions of parameters on large datasets (Brown et al., 2020; Kolesnikov et al., 2020). Such problems may take years of computations to be solved if executed on a single yet powerful machine (Li, 2020). To circumvent this issue, it is natural to use distributed optimization algorithms allowing to tremendously reduce the training time (Goyal et al., 2017; You et al., 2020). In the context of speeding up the training, distributed methods are usually applied in data centers (Mikami et al., 2018). More recently, similar ideas have been applied to train models using open collaborations (Kijspongse et al., 2018; Diskin et al., 2021), where each participant (e.g., a small company/university or an individual) has very limited computing power but can donate it to jointly solve computationally-hard problems. Moreover, in Federated Learning (FL) applications (McMahan et al., 2017; Konečný et al., 2016; Kairouz et al., 2021), distributed algorithms are natural and the only possible choice since in such problems, the data is privately distributed across multiple devices.

In the optimization problems arising in collaborative and federated learning, there is a high risk that some participants deviate from the prescribed protocol either on purpose or not. For example, some peers can maliciously send incorrect gradients to slow down or even destroy the training<sup>1</sup>. Indeed, these attacks can break the convergence of naïve methods such as Parallel-SGD (Zinkevich et al., 2010). Therefore, it is crucial to use secure (a.k.a. Byzantine-robust/Byzantine-tolerant) distributed methods for solving such problems.

However, designing distributed methods with provable Byzantine-robustness is not an easy task. The non-triviality of this problem comes from the fact that the stochastic gradients of good/honest/regular

workers are naturally different due to their stochasticity and possible data heterogeneity. At the same time, malicious workers can send the vectors looking like the stochastic gradients of good peers or create small but time-coupled shifts. Therefore, as it is shown in (Baruch et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2020; Karimireddy et al., 2021), Byzantines can circumvent popular defences based on applying robust aggregation rules (Blanchard et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2018; Damaskinos et al., 2019; Guerraoui et al., 2018; Pillutla et al., 2022) with Parallel-SGD. Moreover, in a broad class of problems with heterogeneous data, it is provably impossible to achieve any predefined accuracy of the solution (Karimireddy et al., 2022; El-Mhamdi et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, as it becomes evident from the further discussion, several works have provable Byzantine tolerance and rigorous theoretical analysis. In particular, Wu et al. (2020) propose a natural yet elegant solution to the problem of Byzantine-robustness based on the usage of variance-reduced methods (Gower et al., 2020) and design the first variance-reduced Byzantine-robust method called Byrd-SAGA, which combines the celebrated SAGA method (Defazio et al., 2014) with geometric median aggregation rule. As a result, reducing the stochastic noise of estimators used by good workers makes it easier to filter out Byzantines (especially in the case of homogeneous data). However, Wu et al. (2020) derive their results only for the strongly convex objectives, and the obtained convergence guarantees are significantly worse than the best-known convergence rates for SAGA, i.e., their results are not tight, even when there are no Byzantine workers and all peers have homogeneous data. It is crucial to bypass these limitations since the majority of the modern, practically interesting problems are non-convex. Furthermore, it is hard to develop the field without tight convergence guarantees. All in all, the above leads to the following question:

Q1: Is it possible to design variance-reduced methods with provable Byzantine-robustness and tight theoretical guarantees for general non-convex optimization problems?

In addition to Byzantine-robustness, one has to take into account that naïve distributed algorithms suffer from the so-called communication bottleneck—a situation when communication is much more expensive than local computations on the devices. This issue is especially evident in the training of models with a vast number of parameters (e.g., millions or trillions) or when the number of workers is large (which is often the case in FL). One of the most popular approaches to reducing the communication bottleneck is to use communication compression (Seide et al., 2014; Konečný et al., 2016; Suresh et al., 2017), i.e., instead of transmitting dense vectors (stochastic gradients/Hessians/higher-order tensors) workers apply some compression/sparsification operator to these vectors and send the compressed results to the server. Distributed learning with compression is a relatively well-developed field, e.g., see (Vogels et al., 2019; Gorbunov et al., 2020b; Richtárik et al., 2021; Philippenko & Dieuleveut, 2021) and references therein for the recent advances.

Perhaps surprisingly, there are not many methods with compressed communication in the context of Byzantine-robust learning. In particular, we are only aware of the following works (Bernstein et al., 2018; Ghosh et al., 2020; 2021; Zhu & Ling, 2021). Bernstein et al. (2018) propose signSGD to reduce communication cost and study the majority vote to cope with the Byzantines under some additional assumptions about adversaries. However, it is known that signSGD is not guaranteed to converge (Karimireddy et al., 2019). Next, Ghosh et al. (2020; 2021) apply aggregation based on the selection of the norms of the update vectors. In this case, Byzantines can successfully hide in the noise applying SOTA attacks (Baruch et al., 2019). Zhu & Ling (2021) study Byzantine-robust versions of compressed SGD (BR-CSGD) and SAGA (BR-CSAGA) and also propose a combination of DIANA (Mishchenko et al., 2019; Horváth et al., 2019b) with BR-CSAGA called BROADCAST. However, the derived convergence results for these methods have several limitations. First of all, the analysis is given only for strongly convex problems. In addition, it relies on restrictive assumptions. Namely, Zhu & Ling (2021) assume uniform boundedness of the second moment of the stochastic gradient in the analysis of BR-CSGD and BR-CSAGA. This assumption rarely holds in practice, and it also implies the boundedness of the gradients, which contradicts the strong convexity assumption. Next, although the bounded second-moment assumption is not used in the analysis of BROADCAST, Zhu & Ling (2021) derive the rates of BROADCAST under the assumption that the compression operator is very accurate, which implies that in theory workers apply almost no compression to the communicated messages (see remark (5) under Table 2). Finally, even if there are no Byzantines and no compression, similar to the guarantees for Byrd-SAGA, the rates obtained for BR-CSGD, BR-CSAGA, and BROADCAST are outperformed with a large margin by the known rates for SGD

(1) Strong convexity of  $f$  is assumed.

and SAGA. All of these limitations lead to the following question:

Q2: Is it possible to design distributed methods with compression, provable Byzantine-robustness and tight theoretical guarantees without making strong assumptions?

In this paper, we give confirmatory answers to Q1 and Q2 by proposing and rigorously analyzing a new Byzantine-tolerant variance-reduced method with compression called Byz-VR-MARINA. Detailed related work overview is deferred to Appendix A.

Our Contributions. Before we proceed, we need to specify the targeted problem. We consider a centralized distributed learning in the possible presence of malicious or so-called Byzantine peers. We assume that there are  $n$  clients consisting of the two groups:  $[n] = \mathcal{G} \sqcup \mathcal{B}$ , where  $\mathcal{G}$  denotes the set of good clients and  $\mathcal{B}$  is the set of bad/malicious/Byzantine workers. The goal is to solve the following optimization problem

$$
\min  _ {x \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} \left\{f (x) = \frac {1}{G} \sum_ {i \in \mathcal {G}} f _ {i} (x) \right\}, \quad f _ {i} (x) = \frac {1}{m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} f _ {i, j} (x) \quad \forall i \in \mathcal {G}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $G = |\mathcal{G}|$  and functions  $f_{i,j}(x)$  are assumed to be smooth, but not necessarily convex. Here each good client has its dataset of the size  $m$ ,  $f_{i,j}(x)$  is the loss of the model, parameterized by vector  $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , on the  $j$ -th sample from the dataset on the  $i$ -th client. Following the classical convention (Lyu et al., 2020), we make no assumptions on the malicious workers  $\mathcal{B}$ , i.e., Byzantines are allowed to be omniscient. Our main contributions are summarized below.

$\diamond$  New method: Byz-VR-MARINA. We propose a new Byzantine-robust variance-reduced method with compression called Byz-VR-MARINA (Alg. 1). In particular, we make VR-MARINA (Gorbunov et al., 2021b), which is a variance-reduced method with compression, applicable to the context of Byzantine-tolerant distributed learning via using the recent tool of robust agnostic aggregation of Karimireddy et al. (2022). As Tbl. 1 shows, Byz-VR-MARINA and our analysis of the method leads to several important improvements upon the previously best-known methods.

$\diamond$  New SOTA results. Under quite general assumptions listed in Section 2, we prove theoretical convergence results for Byz-VR-MARINA in the cases of smooth non-convex (Thm. 2.1) and Polyak-Lojasiewicz (Thm. 2.2) functions. As Tbl. 2 shows, our complexity bounds in the non-convex case are always better than previously known ones when the target accuracy  $\varepsilon$  is small enough. In the PL case, our results improve upon previously known guarantees when the problem has bad conditioning

Table 2: Comparison of the state-of-the-art complexity results for Byzantine-tolerant distributed methods. Columns: "Assumptions" = additional assumptions to smoothness of all  $f_{i}(x)$ ,  $i \in \mathcal{G}$  (although our results require more refined As. 2.3); "Complexity (NC)" and "Complexity (PL)" = number of communication rounds required to find such  $x$  that  $\mathbb{E}\|\nabla f(x)\|^2 \leq \varepsilon^2$  in the general non-convex case and such  $x$  that  $\mathbb{E}[f(x) - f(x^{*})] \leq \varepsilon$  in PL case respectively. Dependencies on numerical constants (and logarithms in PL setting), smoothness constants, and initial suboptimality are omitted in the complexity bounds. Although BR-SGDm, BR-MVR, BTARD-SGD, Byrd-SAGA, BR-CSGD, BR-CSAGA, BROADCAST are analyzed for unit batchsize only ( $b = 1$ ), one can easily generalize them to the case of  $b > 1$  and we show these generalizations in the table. Notation:  $\varepsilon =$  desired accuracy;  $\delta =$  ratio of Byzantines;  $c =$  parameter of the robust aggregator;  $n =$  total number of workers;  $b =$  batchsize;  $\sigma^2 =$  uniform bound on the variance of stochastic gradients;  $D^2 =$  uniform bound on the second moment of stochastic gradients;  $C =$  the number of workers used by BTARD-SGD for the checks of computations after each step;  $\mu =$  parameter from As. 2.5 (strong convexity parameter in the case of BTARD-SGD, Byrd-SAGA, BR-CSGD, BR-CSAGA, BROADCAST);  $m =$  size of the local dataset on workers;  $p = \min\{b/m, 1/(1+\omega)\} =$  probability of communication in Byz-VR-MARINA.

(5) For this result Zhu & Ling (2021) assume that  $\omega \leq \frac{\mu^2(1 - 2\delta)^2}{56L^2(2 - 2\delta^2)}$ , which is a very restrictive assumption even when  $\delta = 0$ . For example, even for well-conditioned problems with  $\mu / L \sim 10^{-3}$  and  $\delta = 0$  (no Byzantines), this bound implies that  $\omega$  should be not larger than  $10^{-7}$ . Such a value of  $\omega$  corresponds to almost non-compressed communications.

A similar statement holds in PL case as well.

or when  $\varepsilon$  is small enough. Moreover, we provide the first theoretical convergence guarantees for Byzantine-tolerant methods with compression in the non-convex case for arbitrary adversaries.

$\diamond$  Byzantine-tolerant variance-reduced method with tight rates. Our results are tight, i.e., when there are no Byzantines, our rates recover the rates of VR-MARINA, and when additionally no compression is applied, we recover the optimal rates of Geom-SARAH (Horvath et al., 2022)/PAGE (Li et al., 2021). In contrast, this is not the case for previously known variance-reduced Byzantine-robust methods such as Byrd-SAGA, BR-CSAGA, and BROADCAST that in the homogeneous data scenario have worse rates than single-machine SAGA.

$\diamond$  Support of the compression without strong assumptions. As we point out in Tbl. 2, the analysis of BR-CSGD and BR-CSAGA relies on the bounded second-moment assumption, which contradicts strong convexity, and the rates for BROADCAST are derived under the assumption that

the compression operator almost coincides with the identity operator, meaning that in practice workers essentially do not use any compression. In contrast, our analysis does not have such substantial limitations.

$\diamond$  Enabling non-uniform sampling. In contrast to the existing works on Byzantine-robustness, our analysis supports non-uniform sampling of stochastic gradients. Considering the dependencies on smoothness constants, one can quickly notice our rates' even more significant superiority compared to the previous SOTA results.

# 2 Byz-VR-MARINA: BYZANTINE-TOLERANT VARIANCE REDUCTION WITH COMMUNICATION COMPRESSION

We start by introducing necessary definitions and assumptions.

Robust aggregation. One of the main building blocks of our method relies on the notion of  $(\delta, c)$ -Robust Aggregator introduced in (Karimireddy et al., 2021; 2022).

Definition 2.1  $((\delta, c)$ -Robust Aggregator). Assume that  $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$  is such that there exists a subset  $\mathcal{G} \subseteq [n]$  of size  $|\mathcal{G}| = G \geq (1 - \delta)n$  for  $\delta < 0.5$  and there exists  $\sigma \geq 0$  such that  $\frac{1}{G(G - 1)} \sum_{i, l \in \mathcal{G}} \mathbb{E}[||x_i - x_l||^2] \leq \sigma^2$  where the expectation is taken w.r.t. the randomness of  $\{x_i\}_{i \in \mathcal{G}}$ . We say that the quantity  $\widehat{x}$  is  $(\delta, c)$ -Robust Aggregator  $((\delta, c)$ -RAgG) and write  $\widehat{x} = RAgG(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$  for some  $c > 0$ , if the following inequality holds:

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \| \widehat {x} - \bar {x} \| ^ {2} \right] \leq c \delta \sigma^ {2}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $\overline{x} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{G}|}\sum_{i\in \mathcal{G}}x_i$ . If additionally  $\widehat{x}$  is computed without the knowledge of  $\sigma^2$ , we say that  $\widehat{x}$  is  $(\delta, c)$ -Agnostic Robust Aggregator  $((\delta, c)\text{-ARAgg})$  and write  $\widehat{x} = \mathsf{ARAgg}(x_1,\ldots ,x_n)$ .

In fact, Karimireddy et al. (2021; 2022) propose slightly different definition, where they assume that  $\mathbb{E}\| x_i - x_l\|^2 \leq \sigma^2$  for all fixed good workers  $i, l \in \mathcal{G}$ , which is marginally stronger than what we assume. Karimireddy et al. (2021) prove tightness of their definition, i.e., up to the constant  $c$  one cannot improve bound (2), and prove that popular "middle-seekers" such as Krum (Blanchard et al., 2017), Robust Federated Averaging (RFA) (Pillutla et al., 2022), and Coordinate-wise Median (CM) (Chen et al., 2017) do not satisfy their definition. However, there is a trick called bucketing (Karimireddy et al., 2022) that provably robustifies Krum/RFA/CM. Nevertheless, the difference between our definition and the original one from (Karimireddy et al., 2021; 2022) is very subtle and it turns out that Krum/RFA/CM with bucketing fit Definition 2.1 as well (see Appendix D).

Compression. We consider unbiased compression operators, i.e., quantizations.

Definition 2.2 (Unbiased compression (Horváth et al., 2019b)). Stochastic mapping  $\mathcal{Q}:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}^d$  is called unbiased compressor/compression operator if there exists  $\omega \geq 0$  such that for any  $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ Q (x) \right] = x, \quad \mathbb {E} \left[ \| Q (x) - x \| ^ {2} \right] \leq \omega \| x \| ^ {2}. \tag {3}
$$

For the given unbiased compressor  $\mathcal{Q}(x)$ , one can define the expected density as  $\zeta_{\mathcal{Q}} = \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} \mathbb{E}\left[\|\mathcal{Q}(x)\|_0\right]$ , where  $\|y\|_0$  is the number of non-zero components of  $y \in \mathbb{R}^d$ .

The above definition covers many popular compression operators such as RandK sparsification (Stich et al., 2018), random dithering (Goodall, 1951; Roberts, 1962), and natural compression (Horváth et al., 2019a) (see also the summary of various compression operators in (Beznosikov et al., 2020)). There exist also other classes of compression operators such as  $\delta$ -contractive compressors (Stich et al., 2018) and absolute compressors (Tang et al., 2019; Sahu et al., 2021). However, these types of compressors are out of the scope of this work.

Assumptions. The first assumption is quite standard in the literature on non-convex optimization.

Assumption 2.1. We assume that function  $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$  is  $L$ -smooth, i.e., for all  $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d$  we have  $\| \nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y) \| \leq L \| x - y \|$ . Moreover, we assume that  $f$  is uniformly lower bounded by  $f_* \in \mathbb{R}$ , i.e.,  $f_* = \inf_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x)$ .

Next, we need to restrict the data heterogeneity of regular workers. Indeed, in arbitrarily heterogeneous scenario, it is impossible to distinguish regular workers and Byzantines. Therefore, we use a quite standard assumption about the heterogeneity of the local loss functions.

Assumption 2.2 ( $\zeta^2$ -heterogeneity). We assume that good clients have  $\zeta^2$ -heterogeneous local loss functions for some  $\zeta \geq 0$ , i.e.,

$$
\frac {1}{G} \sum_ {i \in \mathcal {G}} \| \nabla f _ {i} (x) - \nabla f (x) \| ^ {2} \leq \zeta^ {2} \quad \forall x \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}. \tag {4}
$$

We emphasize here that the homogeneous data case  $(\zeta = 0)$  is realistic in collaborative learning. This typically means that the workers have an access to the entire data. For example, this can be implemented using so-called dataset streaming when the data is received just in time in chunks (Diskin et al., 2021; Kajsipongse et al., 2018) (this can also be implemented without using the server via special protocols similar to BitTorrent).

The following assumption is a refinement of a standard assumption that  $f_{i}$  is  $L_{i}$ -smooth for all  $i \in \mathcal{G}$ .

Assumption 2.3 (Global Hessian variance assumption (Szlendak et al., 2021)). We assume that there exists  $L_{\pm} \geq 0$  such that for all  $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d$

$$
\frac {1}{G} \sum_ {i \in \mathcal {G}} \| \nabla f _ {i} (x) - \nabla f _ {i} (y) \| ^ {2} - \| \nabla f (x) - \nabla f (y) \| ^ {2} \leq L _ {\pm} ^ {2} \| x - y \| ^ {2}. \tag {5}
$$

If  $f_{i}$  is  $L_{i}$ -smooth for all  $i \in \mathcal{G}$ , then the above assumption is always valid for some  $L_{\pm} \geq 0$  such that  $L_{\mathrm{avg}}^2 - L^2 \leq L_{\pm}^2 \leq L_{\mathrm{avg}}^2$ , where  $L_{\mathrm{avg}}^2 = \frac{1}{G} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{G}} L_i^2$  (Szlendak et al., 2021). Moreover, Szlendak et al. (2021) show that there exist problems with heterogeneous functions on workers such that (5) holds with  $L_{\pm} = 0$ , while  $L_{\mathrm{avg}} > 0$ .

We propose a generalization of the above assumption for samplings of stochastic gradients.

Assumption 2.4 (Local Hessian variance assumption). We assume that there exists  $\mathcal{L}_{\pm} \geq 0$  such that for all  $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d$

$$
\frac {1}{G} \sum_ {i \in \mathcal {G}} \mathbb {E} \| \widehat {\Delta} _ {i} (x, y) - \Delta_ {i} (x, y) \| ^ {2} \leq \frac {\mathcal {L} _ {\pm} ^ {2}}{b} \| x - y \| ^ {2}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\Delta_i(x,y) = \nabla f_i(x) - \nabla f_i(y)$  and  $\widehat{\Delta}_i(x,y)$  is an unbiased mini-batched estimator of  $\Delta_i(x,y)$  with batch size  $b$ .

We notice that the above assumption covers a wide range of samplings of mini-batched stochastic gradient differences, e.g., standard uniform sampling or importance sampling. We provide the examples in Appendix E.1. We notice that all previous works on Byzantine-robustness focus on the standard uniform sampling only. However, uniform sampling can give  $m$  times worse constant  $\mathcal{L}_{\pm}^{2}$  than importance sampling. This difference significantly affects the complexity bounds.

New Method: Byz-VR-MARINA. Now we are ready to present our new method—Byzantine-tolerant Variance-Reduced MARINA (Byz-VR-MARINA). Our algorithm is based on the recently proposed variance-reduced method with compression (VR-MARINA) from (Gorbunov et al., 2021b). At each iteration of Byz-VR-MARINA, good workers update their parameters  $x^{k+1} = x^k - \gamma g^k$  using estimator  $g^k$  received from the parameter-server (line 7). Next (line 8), with (typically small) probability  $p$  each good worker  $i \in \mathcal{G}$  computes its full gradient, and with (typically large) probability  $1 - p$  this worker computes compressed mini-batched stochastic gradient difference  $\mathcal{Q}(\widehat{\Delta}_i(x^{k+1}, x^k))$ , where  $\widehat{\Delta}_i(x^{k+1}, x^k)$  satisfies Assumption 2.4. After that, the server gathers the results of computations from the workers and applies  $(\delta, c)$ -ARAgg to compute the next estimator  $g^{k+1}$  (line 10).

Let us elaborate on several important parts of the proposed algorithm. First, we point out that with large probability  $1 - p$  good workers need to send just compressed vectors  $\mathcal{Q}(\widehat{\Delta}_i(x^{k + 1},x^k))$ ,  $i\in \mathcal{G}$ . Indeed, since the server knows when workers compute full gradients and when they compute compressed stochastic gradients, it needs just to add  $g^{k}$  to all received vectors to perform robust aggregation from line 10. Moreover, since the server knows the type of compression operator that good workers apply, it can typically easily filter out those Byzantines who try to slow down the training via sending dense vectors instead of compressed ones (e.g., if the compression operator is RandK sparsification, then Byzantines cannot send more than  $K$  components; otherwise they will be easily detected and can be banned). Next, the right choice of probability  $p$  allows equalizing the

communication cost of all steps when good workers send dense gradients and compressed gradient differences. The same is true for oracle complexity: if  $p \leq b / m$ , then the computational cost of full-batch computations is not bigger than that of stochastic gradients.

Challenges in designing variance-reduced algorithm with tight rates and provable Byzantine-robustness. In the introduction, we explain why variance reduction is a natural way to handle Byzantine attacks (see the discussion before Q1). At first glance, it seems that one can take any variance-reduced method and combine it with some robust aggregation rule to get the result. However, this is not as straightforward as it may appear. As one can see from Table 2, combination of SAGA with geometric median estimator (Byrd-SAGA) gives the rate  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{m^2}{b^2(1 - 2\delta)\mu^2}\right)$  (smoothness constant and logarithmic factors are omitted) in the smooth strongly convex case — this rate is in fact  $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m^2}{b^2\mu^2}\right)$  times worse than the rate of SAGA even when  $\delta = 0$ . Therefore, it becomes clear that the full potential of variance reduction in Byzantine-robust learning is not revealed via Byrd-SAGA.

The key reason for that is the sensitivity of SAGA (and SAGA-based methods) to the unbiasedness of the stochastic estimator in the analysis. Since Byrd-SAGA uses the geometric median for the aggregation, which is necessarily biased, it is natural that it has a much worse convergence rate than SAGA even in the  $\delta = 0$  case. Moreover, one can't solve such an issue by simply changing one robust estimator for another since all known robust estimators are generally biased.

To circumvent this issue, we consider Geom-SARAH/PAGE-based estimator (Horváth & Richtárik, 2019; Li et al., 2021) and study how it interacts with the robust aggregation. In particular, we observe that the averaged pair-wise variance for the stochastic gradients of good workers could be upper bounded by a constant multiplied by  $\mathbb{E}\| x^{k + 1} - x^k\|^2$  plus some additional terms appearing due to heterogeneity (see Lemma E.2). Then, we notice that the robust aggregation only leads to the additional term proportional to  $\mathbb{E}\| x^{k + 1} - x^k\|^2$  (plus additional terms due to heterogeneity). We show that this term can be directly controlled using another term proportional to  $-\mathbb{E}\| x^{k + 1} - x^k\|^2$ , which appears in the original analysis of PAGE/VR-MARINA.

These facts imply that although the difference between Byz-VR-MARINA and VR-MARINA is only in the choice of the aggregation rule, it is not straightforward beforehand that such a combination should be considered and that it will lead to better rates. Moreover, as we show next, we obtain vast improvements upon the previously best-known theoretical results for Byzantine-tolerant learning.

General Non-Convex Functions. Our main convergence result for general non-convex functions follows. All proofs are deferred to Appendix E.

Theorem 2.1. Let Assumptions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 hold. Assume that  $0 < \gamma \leq \frac{1}{L + \sqrt{A}}$ , where  $A = \frac{6(1 - p)}{p}\left(\frac{4c\delta}{p} + \frac{1}{2G}\right)\left(\omega L^2 + \frac{(1 + \omega)\mathcal{L}_{\pm}^2}{b}\right) + \frac{6(1 - p)}{p}\left(\frac{4c\delta(1 + \omega)}{p} + \frac{\omega}{2G}\right)L_{\pm}^2$ . Then for all  $K \geq 0$  the point  $\widehat{x}^K$  chosen uniformly at random from the iterates  $x^0, x^1, \ldots, x^K$  produced by  $\mathsf{Byz - VR - }$

MARINA satisfies

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \| \nabla f (\widehat {x} ^ {K}) \| ^ {2} \right] \leq \frac {2 \Phi_ {0}}{\gamma (K + 1)} + \frac {2 4 c \delta \zeta^ {2}}{p}, \tag {7}
$$

where  $\Phi_0 = f(x^0) - f_* + \frac{\gamma}{p}\| g^0 -\nabla f(x^0)\| ^2$

We highlight here several important properties of the derived result. First of all, this is the first theoretical result for the convergence of Byzantine-tolerant methods with compression in the nonconvex case with arbitrary adversaries. Next, when  $\zeta > 0$  the theorem above does not guarantee that  $\mathbb{E}[\| \nabla f(\hat{x}^K) \|^2]$  can be made arbitrarily small. However, this is not a drawback of our analysis but rather an inevitable limitation of all algorithms in heterogeneous case. This is due to Karimireddy et al. (2022) who proved a lower bound showing that in the presence of Byzantines, all algorithms satisfy  $\mathbb{E}[\| \nabla f(\hat{x}^K) \|^2] = \Omega(\delta \zeta^2)$ , i.e., the constant term from (7) is tight up to the factor of  $1/p$ . However, when  $\zeta = 0$ , Byz-VR-MARINA can achieve any predefined accuracy of the solution, if  $\delta$  is such that ARAgg is  $(\delta, c)$ -robust (see Theorem D.1). Finally, as Table 2 shows², Byz-VR-MARINA achieves  $\mathbb{E}[\| \nabla f(\hat{x}^K) \|^2] \leq \varepsilon^2$  faster than all previously known Byzantine-tolerant methods for small enough  $\varepsilon$ . Moreover, unlike virtually all other results in the non-convex case, Theorem 2.1 does not rely on the uniformly bounded variance assumption, which is known to be very restrictive (Nguyen et al., 2018).

Functions Satisfying Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) Condition. We extend our theory to the functions satisfying Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition (Polyak, 1963; Lojasiewicz, 1963). This assumption generalizes regular strong convexity and holds for several non-convex problems (Karimi et al., 2016). Moreover, a very similar assumption appears in over-parameterized deep learning (Liu et al., 2022).

Assumption 2.5 (PL condition). We assume that function  $f$  satisfies Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition with parameter  $\mu$ , i.e., for all  $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$  there exists  $x^{*} \in \operatorname{argmin}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}} f(x)$  such that

$$
\left\| \nabla f (x) \right\| ^ {2} \geq 2 \mu (f (x) - f \left(x ^ {*}\right)). \tag {8}
$$

Under this and previously introduced assumptions, we derive the following result.

Theorem 2.2. Let Assumptions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 hold. Assume that  $0 < \gamma \leq \min \left\{\frac{1}{L + \sqrt{2A}}, \frac{p}{4\mu}\right\}$ , where  $A = \frac{6(1 - p)}{p} \left(\frac{4c\delta}{p} + \frac{1}{2G}\right) \left(\omega L^2 + \frac{(1 + \omega)\mathcal{L}_{\pm}^2}{b}\right) + \frac{6(1 - p)}{p} \left(\frac{4c\delta(1 + \omega)}{p} + \frac{\omega}{2G}\right)L_{\pm}^2$ . Then for all  $K \geq 0$  the iterates produced by  $\mathsf{Byz - VR - MARINA}$  satisfy

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ f \left(x ^ {K}\right) - f \left(x ^ {*}\right) \right] \leq (1 - \gamma \mu) ^ {K} \Phi_ {0} + \frac {2 4 c \delta \zeta^ {2}}{\mu}, \tag {9}
$$

where  $\Phi_0 = f(x^0) - f_* + \frac{2\gamma}{p}\| g^0 -\nabla f(x^0)\| ^2$

Similarly to the general non-convex case, in the PL-setting  $\mathsf{Byz}$ -VR-MARINA is able to achieve  $\mathbb{E}[f(x^K) - f(x^*)] = \mathcal{O}(c\delta \zeta^2 /\mu)$  accuracy, which matches (up to the factor of  $1 / p$ ) the lower bound from Karimireddy et al. (2022) derived for  $\mu$ -strongly convex objectives. Next, when  $\zeta = 0$ ,  $\mathsf{Byz}$ -VR-MARINA converges linearly asymptotically to the exact solution. Moreover, as Table 2 shows, our convergence result in the PL-setting outperforms the known rates in more restrictive strongly-convex setting. In particular, when  $\varepsilon$  is small enough,  $\mathsf{Byz}$ -VR-MARINA has better complexity than BTARD-SGD. When the conditioning of the problem is bad (i.e.,  $L / \mu \gg 1$ ) our rate dominates results of BR-CSGD, BR-CSAGA, and BROADCAST. Furthermore, both BR-CSGD and BR-CSAGA rely on the uniformly bounded second moment assumption (contradicting the strong convexity), and the rate of the BROADCAST algorithm is based on the assumption that  $\omega = \mathcal{O}(\mu^2 /L^2)$  implying that  $\mathcal{Q}(x)\approx x$  (no compression) even for well-conditioned problems.

# 3 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed method. The main goal of our experimental evaluation is to showcase the benefits of employing SOTA variance reduction to remedy the presence of Byzantine workers. For the task, we consider the standard logistic regression model with  $\ell_2$ -regularization  $f_{i,j}(x) = -y_{i,j}\log (h(x,a_{i,j})) - (1 - y_{i,j})\log (1 - h(x,a_{i,j})) + \lambda \| x\|^2$  where  $y_{i,j}\in \{0,1\}$  is the label,  $a_{i,j}\in \mathbb{R}^d$  represents the features vector,  $\lambda$  is the regularization parameter and  $h(x,a) = 1 / (1 + e^{-a^\top x})$ . One can show that this objective is smooth, and for  $\lambda >0$ , it is also strongly convex, therefore, it satisfies PLcondition. We consider a9a LIBSVM dataset (Chang & Lin, 2011) and set  $\lambda = 0.01$ . In the experiments, we focus on an important feature of Byz-VRMARINA: it guarantees linear convergence for homogeneous datasets across clients even in the presence of Byzantine workers, as shown in Theorem 2.2. To demonstrate this experimentally, we consider the setup with four good workers and one Byzantine, each worker can access the entire dataset, and the server uses coordinate-wise median with bucketing as the aggregator (see the details in Appendix D). We consider five different attacks:

- No Attack (NA): clean training;  
- Label Flipping (LF): labels are flipped, i.e.,  $y_{i,j} \to 1 - y_{i,j}$  
- Bit Flipping (BF): a Byzantine worker sends an update with flipped sign;  
- A Little is enough (ALIE) (Baruch et al., 2019): the Byzantines estimate the mean  $\mu_{\mathcal{G}}$  and standard deviation  $\sigma_{\mathcal{G}}$  of the good updates, and send  $\mu_{\mathcal{G}} - z\sigma_{\mathcal{G}}$  to the server where  $z$  is a small constant controlling the strength of the attack;  
- Inner Product Manipulation (IPM) (Xie et al., 2020): the attackers send  $-\frac{\epsilon}{G}\sum_{i\in G}\nabla f_i(x)$  where  $\epsilon$  controls the strength of the attack. For bucketing, we use  $s = 2$ , i.e., partitioning the updates into the groups of two, as recommended by Karimireddy et al. (2022).

We compare our Byz-VR-MARINA with the baselines without compression (SGD, BR-SGDm (Karimireddy et al., 2021)) and the baselines with random sparsification (compressed SGD and DIANA (BR-DIANA). We do not compare against Byrd-SAGA (and BR-CSAGA, BROADCAST from Zhu & Ling (2021)), which consumes large memory that scales linearly with the number of local data points and is not well suited for memory-efficient batched gradient computation (e.g., used in PyTorch). Our implementation is based on PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019). Figure 1 showcases that, indeed, we observe linear convergence of our method while no baseline achieves this fast rate. In the first row, we display methods with no compression, and in the second row, each algorithm uses random sparsification. We defer further details and additional experiments with heterogeneous data to Appendix B.
