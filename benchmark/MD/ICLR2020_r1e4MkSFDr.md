# ABSTRACT

Convolutional neural network (CNN) for time series data implicitly assumes that the data are uniformly sampled, whereas many event-based and multi-modal data are nonuniform or have heterogeneous sampling rates. Directly applying regular CNN to nonuniform time series is ungrounded, because it is unable to recognize and extract common patterns from the nonuniform input signals. Converting the nonuniform time series to uniform ones by interpolation preserves the pattern extraction capability of CNN, but the interpolation kernels are often preset and may be unsuitable for the data or tasks. In this paper, we propose the Continuous CNN (CCNN), which estimates the inherent continuous inputs by interpolation, and performs continuous convolution on the continuous input. The interpolation and convolution kernels are learned in an end-to-end manner, and are able to learn useful patterns despite the nonuniform sampling rate. Besides, CCNN is a strict generalization to CNN. Results of several experiments verify that CCNN achieves a better performance on nonuniform data, and learns meaningful continuous kernels.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Convolutional neural network (CNN), together with recurrent neural network (RNN), is among the most popular deep learning architectures to process time series data. However, both CNN and RNN rest on the assumption that both the input and output data are sampled uniformly. However, many time-series data are event-based and thus not uniform in time, such as stock price (Gençay et al., 2001), social media data (Chang et al., 2016) and health care data (Johnson et al., 2016).

There are several easy solutions to adapt CNN to accommodate nonuniform time series. The first solution is to directly append the time stamps or time intervals to the input features, which are then fed into a regular CNN (Zhang et al., 2017). However, the problem is that, without the uniform sampling assumptions, the application of the regular CNN is ungrounded, and thus the performance is compromised. This is because one major justification of CNN is that the filters/kernels are able to extract useful patterns from input signals. But if the sampling rate varies, the traditional CNN will no longer be able to recognize the same pattern.

A second obvious solution is to transform the nonuniform time series to uniform by interpolation, and then feed the transformed signal to a regular CNN. This approach preserves CNN's ability to extract signal patterns despite the nonuniform sampling. However, simple interpolation schemes require preset interpolation kernels, which is not flexible and may not fit the signal or the task well. To sum up, most existing CNN-based remedies for nonuniform time series either cannot reasonably capture the signal patterns or are too inflexible to maximize the performance in a data-driven manner.

Motivated by these challenges, we propose Continuous CNN (CCNN), a generalization to CNN for nonuniform time series. CCNN estimates the implicit continuous signal by interpolation, yet performs continuous convolution on the continuous signal. As a result, CCNN is capable of capturing the useful patterns in the implicit input signal, which is of nonuniform sampling rate or naturally has uneven time interval. Furthermore, the interpolation and convolution kernel functions are not preset, but rather learned in an end-to-end manner, so that the interpolation is tailored for each task. Finally, we show that CCNN and CNN are equivalent in terms of representation power under uniform sampling rate. As shown in section 5, CCNN can achieve much better performance than the state-of-the-art systems on non-uniform time series data.

Figure 1: CCNN Structure for predicting future events. Given uniform-interval time sequence  $\{t_i'\}$ , CCNN layer performs both interpolating non-uniformly sampled signal sequence  $\{x(t_i)\}$  to  $\{x(t_i')\}$  and convolution  $\{\{y(t_i')\}\}$ . Now that  $\{y(t_i')\}$  is uniformly resampled, normal convolution layer can be applied.

The proposed CCNN can also be well-combined with temporal point process (TPP). TPP is a random process of event occurrence, which is capable of modeling nonuniform time intervals. However, most existing TPPs require inflexible preset parameterization. CCNN is able to expand the power of TPP by replacing the modeling of the history contribution with a CCNN module.

# 2 RELATED WORKS

There are some research efforts of adapting RNN for nonuniform series. Some works (Pearlmutter, 2008; Funahashi & Nakamura, 1993; Cauwenberghs, 1996) use continuous-time dynamical system methods to design RNN structures. Phased-LSTM (Neil et al., 2016) and Time-LSTM (Zhu et al., 2017) introduce a time gate that passes the data at a certain frequency. Similar ideas can be found in Clockwork RNN (Koutnik et al., 2014) and DilatedRNN (Chang et al., 2017). (Mei & Eisner, 2017) and (Du et al., 2016) explicitly model the sequence as temporal point process and utilize RNN structure to encode the sequence history.

For non-neural network based approaches, the probabilistic generation process of both events and its time stamps is assumed. (Liu & Hauskrecht, 2016) deals with irregularly sampled time series by direct value interpolation and estimates the model via EM algorithm. (Wang et al., 2016; Du et al., 2015) base their model on Hawkes process and estimate via conditional gradient algorithm.

The proposed CCNN is well supported by works on spiking neural networks (SNN) (Maass, 1997), which mimic how human brains process information. The inputs to SNNs are spike chains with nonuniform intervals that carry information. An important class SNNs (Eliasmith & Anderson, 2004; Tapson & van Schaik, 2013; Tapson et al., 2013) convolves the input with continuous kernel functions, which is similar to the key step of CCNN. However, CCNN differs from SNN in two aspects. First, for SNN, the input information resides in time intervals, not in the inputs values; the goal of the SNN convolution is to extract time interval information. In contrast, the input information for CCNN resides in input values, not time intervals; the goal of the continuous convolution is to remove the interference of nonuniform sampling. Second, CCNN learns the kernel functions in a data-driven manner, whereas SNN employs predefined kernel functions.

Nonuniform time series processing is related to the task of point set classification, where the input is a set of points nonuniformly distributed in the  $\mathbb{R}^d$  space ( $d = 3$  in most cases). Several existing methods directly work on the coordinates of the points (Qi et al., 2017a;b). Some alternative approaches turn the point sets into graphs by establishing edge connections among nearest neighbors (Shen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018). The graph approaches utilize the distance information to some degree, but the distance information is quantized. CCNN, on the other hand, make full use of the time interval information.

# 3 THE CCNN ALGORITHM

Our problem is formulated as follows. Given a nonuniform input sequence  $x(t_{1}), x(t_{2}), \dots, x(t_{N}) \in \mathcal{X}_{\mathrm{in}}$ , where the input time stamps  $t_{n} \in \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{in}}$  can be distributed nonuniformly, our goal is to design a continuous convolutional layer that can produce output for any arbitrary output time  $t$ ,  $y(t)$ .

The proposed CCNN solves the problem via two steps:

(1) interpolation to recover the continuous signal  $\hat{x} (t)$  
(2) continuous convolution on  $\hat{x} (t)$

Furthermore, rather than applying a preset interpolation, CCNN learns the interpolation kernel and the convolution kernel in an end-to-end manner. The following two subsections elaborate on the two steps respectively. The channel dimension and input dimension are set to one for simplification.

# 3.1 INTERPOLATION

CCNN reconstructs the underlying continuous input signal,  $\hat{x}(t)$ , by interpolating among nonuniform input samples.

$$
\hat {x} (t) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} x \left(t _ {i}\right) I \left(t - t _ {i}; \mathcal {F} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {X} _ {\mathrm {i n}}\right) + \varepsilon \left(t; \mathcal {F} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {X} _ {\mathrm {i n}}\right) \tag {1}
$$

where the first term is the interpolation term, and  $I(\cdot)$  is the interpolation kernel; the second term is the error correction term. For the first term, a form analogous to the Parzen window approach Parzen (1962) is used. Many interpolation algorithms can be expressed in this form (refer to Appendix A.1, illustrated in Fig. 6. Considering the versatility of  $I(\cdot)$ , the interpolation algorithms representable by Eq. (1) are vast. The error correction term,  $\varepsilon (\cdot)$ , are assumed to be determined by the input output time stamps and input values, hence its arguments include  $t$ ,  $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{in}}$  and  $\mathcal{X}_{\mathrm{in}}$ .

# 3.2 CONTINUOUS CONVOLUTION

Analogous to a standard CNN layer, after the continuous input is estimated by interpolation, the CCNN layer performs a continuous convolution to produce the final output.

$$
y (t) = \hat {x} (t) * C (t) + b \tag {2}
$$

where  $*$  denotes continuous convolution,  $C(t)$  denotes the convolution kernel, and  $b$  denotes bias.

Unfortunately,  $I(\cdot), \varepsilon(\cdot)$  and  $C(\cdot)$  are not individually identifiable. To see this, we combine Eqs. (1) and (2).

$$
\begin{array}{l} y (t) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} x \left(t _ {i}\right) \underbrace {\left[ I \left(t - t _ {i} ; \mathcal {F} _ {\mathrm {i n}} , \mathcal {X} _ {\mathrm {i n}}\right) * C (t) \right]} _ {\text {c o l l a p s e d k e r n e l f u n c t i o n}} + \underbrace {\left[ \varepsilon \left(t ; \mathcal {F} _ {\mathrm {i n}} , \mathcal {X} _ {\mathrm {i n}}\right) * C (t) + b \right]} _ {\text {c o l l a p s e d b i a s f u n c t i o n}} \tag {3} \\ = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} x (t _ {i}) K (t - t _ {i}; \mathcal {I} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {X} _ {\mathrm {i n}}) + \beta (t; \mathcal {I} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {X} _ {\mathrm {i n}}) \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $K(t; \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{in}}, \mathcal{X}_{\mathrm{in}})$  is the collapsed kernel function, representing the combined effect of interpolation and convolution;  $\beta(t; \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{in}}, \mathcal{X}_{\mathrm{in}})$  is the collapsed bias function, representing the combined effect of error correction and convolution.

Eq. (3) shows that learning the interpolation and convolution kernels and errors is now simplified into learning the collapsed kernel and bias functions. Once these two functions are learned, the final output can be readily computed using Eq. (3). The next section will explain how CCNN is structured to learn these functions in an end-to-end manner.

# 4 THE CCNN STRUCTURE

Following the discussion in Sec. 3, a CCNN layer is divided into three parts: the kernel network learning the collapsed kernel function, the bias network learning the collapsed bias function, and the main network producing the final output using Eq. (3).

# 4.1 THE KERNEL NETWORK

The basic idea of the kernel network is to represent the kernel function using a neural network, based on the fact that a neural network can represent any function given enough layers and nodes (Hornik, 1991). In order to regularize the complexity, a few assumptions on  $K(\cdot)$  are introduced:

![](images/1706a217c34e0db5ecf2994d9eda6fffc3a9b34e8551a733a422de66562ad373.jpg)

(b) Bias network.  
(c) Compute  $y(t)$  by collapsed interpolation and convolution.  $K(t - t_{i})$  is the shorthand for  $K(t - t_i;\mathcal{T}_{in},\mathcal{X}_{in})$  
Figure 2: CCNN structure.

![](images/1b22cf105052a082f4759b17d0d187ab70fd8b63d0deb21706bbe95d3ff2d949.jpg)

Stationarity and Finite Dependency: The dependency of  $K(\cdot)$  on  $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{in}}$  is relative to the output time  $t$ , and is constrained to among the adjacent time stamps, i.e.

$$
K \left(t - t _ {i}; \mathcal {T} _ {\text {i n}}, \mathcal {X} _ {\text {i n}}\right) = K \left(\left\{t - t _ {i \pm k}, x \left(t _ {i \pm k}\right) \right\} _ {k = 0: O _ {K}}\right) \tag {4}
$$

where  $\{t - t_{i\pm k},x(t_{i\pm k})\}_{k = 0:O_K}$  denotes the set of  $t - t_{i\pm k}$  and  $x(t_{i\pm k})$  where  $k$  runs from 0 to  $O_K$ , and  $O_K$  is the order of the kernel network. Notice that the examples in Eqs. (14)-(16) and many other interpolation kernels still satisfy this assumption.

Finite Kernel Length: The collapsed kernel function has finite length.

$$
K \left(t - t _ {i}; \mathcal {T} _ {\text {i n}}\right) = 0, \forall | t - t _ {i} | > L _ {K} \tag {5}
$$

where  $L_{K}$  is the kernel length. This assumption implies the interpolation and the convolutional kernels both have finite length. While many interpolation kernels do have finite length (e.g. Eqs. (14) and (15)), others do not (e.g. Eq. (16)). Nevertheless, most infinite-length interpolation kernels, including Eq. (16), have tapering tails, and thus truncation on both sides still provides good approximations. Regarding the convolutional kernel, the finite length assumption naturally extends from the standard CNN.

Fig. 2(a) shows the kernel network structure, which is a feedforward network. According to Eq. (4), the input is  $\left(\{t - t_{i\pm k},x(t_{i\pm k})\}_{k = 0:O_K}\right)$ . The output represents the kernel function, which is forced to be zero when  $|t - t_i| > L_K$ . To reduce learning difficulties, the time differences are fed into an optional two-hot encoding layer, which will be discussed later in details.

# 4.2 THE BIAS NETWORK

For the bias network, a similar stationarity and finite dependency assumption is applied as follows.

$$
\beta \left(t; \mathcal {T} _ {\mathrm {i n}}, \mathcal {X} _ {\mathrm {i n}}\right) = \beta \left(\left\{t - t _ {j ^ {*} \pm k}, x \left(t _ {j ^ {*} \pm k}\right) \right\} _ {k = 0: O _ {B}}\right), \tag {6}
$$

where  $t_{j^*}$  is the closest input time stamp to output time  $t$ :

$$
t _ {j ^ {*}} = \underset {t _ {j} \in \mathcal {T} _ {\mathrm {i n}}} {\operatorname {a r g m i n}} | t _ {j} - t | \tag {7}
$$

and  $O_B$  denotes the order of the bias network. The only difference from Eq. (4) is that the closest input time stamp,  $t_{j^*}$ , is chosen as a reference on which the time difference and the adjacent input time stamps are defined, because the major argument of the bias function is the output time itself,  $t$ , instead of the input-output time difference  $t - t_i$ . Fig. 2(b) shows the bias network, which is also a feedforward network.

# 4.3 CAUSAL SETTING

For causal tasks, current output should not depend on future input, and therefore the  $t - t_{i \pm k}$  terms that are greater than 0, as well as the corresponding  $x(t_{i \pm k})$ , are removed from Eq. (4). Similarly,  $t - t_{j^{*} \pm k}$  that are greater than 0, as well as the corresponding  $x(t_{j^{*} \pm k})$ , are removed from Eq. (6). Also, the condition bound in Eq. (5) is replaced with  $t - t_i > L_K$  or  $t - t_i < 0$ .

Figure 3: Two-hot encoding. Each cross on the 1-D axis denotes a value of  $\Delta t$ . The stem plot above shows its two-hot vector. Assuming  $d = 5$ , the left plot shows when  $\Delta t = \pi_{k-1} + 0.4\delta$ , the two-hot encoding of  $\Delta t$  is [0, 0.6, 0.4, 0, 0]. The left plot shows when  $\Delta t = \pi_{k-1}$ , the encoding is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

# 4.4 TWO-HOT ENCODING

The kernel and bias functions can be complicated functions of the input times, so model complexity and convergence can be serious concerns. Therefore, we introduce a two-hot encoding scheme for the input times, which is an extension to the one-hot scheme, but which does not lose information.

Denote the time difference value to be encoded as  $\Delta t$ . Similar to one-hot, the two-hot encoding scheme partitions the range of  $\Delta t$  into  $D - 1$  intervals, whose edges are denoted as  $\pi_1, \pi_2, \dots, \pi_d$ . However, rather than having a length- $D - 1$  vector representing the intervals, two-hot introduces a length- $D$  vector representing the edges. When  $\Delta t$  falls in an interval, the two elements corresponding to its two edges are lit. Formally, denote the encoded vector as  $\pmb{g}$ , and suppose  $\Delta t$  falls in interval  $[\pi_k, \pi_{k+1})$ . Then

$$
\boldsymbol {g} _ {k} = \frac {\pi_ {k + 1} - \Delta t}{\delta}, \boldsymbol {g} _ {k + 1} = \frac {\Delta t - \pi_ {k}}{\delta}; \boldsymbol {g} _ {l} = 0, \forall l \notin \{k, k + 1 \} \tag {8}
$$

where  $\delta = \pi_{k} - \pi_{k-1}$  denotes the interval width (all the intervals are set to have equal width);  $\pmb{g}_{k}$  denotes the  $k$ -th element of  $\pmb{g}$ . Fig. 3 gives an intuitive visualization of the encoding process.

As an example explanation of why two-hot helps, it can be easily shown that a one-layer feedforward network can only learn a linear function (a straight line) without any encoding, but a piecewise constant function with one-hot encoding, and yet a piecewise linear function with two-hot encoding.

# 4.5 COMBINING WITH TEMPORAL POINT PROCESSES

For tasks like predicting the time interval till the next event, the output of CCNN will be the predicted probability distribution of the time interval, which requires a good probabilistic model characterizing the likelihood of these intervals. Temporal point process (TPP) is a popular and general model for the time stamps of the random processes  $\{x(t_i), t_i\}$  whose time intervals are nonuniform. It turns out that CCNN can be well combined with TPPs in modeling the time interval prediction task, in a similarly way to Du et al. (2016).

A TPP is parameterized by  $\lambda^{*}(t)$ , which depicts the rate of the probability of the event occurrence. Formally

$$
\lambda^ {*} (t) d t = P r \left(\text {E v e n t} i \text {h a p p e n s i n} [ t, t + d t) \left| \bigcup_ {j <   i} \{x \left(t _ {j}\right), t _ {j} \} \right.\right) \tag {9}
$$

It can be shown that the probability density function (PDF) of an event happening at time  $t$  conditional on the history of the events  $\bigcup_{j \leq i-1} \{x(t_j), t_j\}$  can be expressed as

$$
f ^ {*} (t) = \lambda^ {*} (t) \exp \left(- \int_ {t _ {i - 1}} ^ {t} \lambda^ {*} (\tau) d \tau\right). \tag {10}
$$

Rather than applying some preset functional form for  $\lambda^{*}(t)$  as in conventional TPPs, we propose to use a CCNN to model  $\lambda^{*}(t)$  as follows. First, we pass the historical time series to a CCNN to learn a history embedding

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {i - 1} = \operatorname {C C N N} \left(\bigcup_ {j \leq i - 1} \{x \left(t _ {j}\right), t _ {j} \}\right), \tag {11}
$$

where CCNN  $(\cdot)$  is just a functional abstraction of CCNN. Then  $\lambda^{*}(t)$  is obtained by combining the history information and the current time information as follows

$$
\lambda^ {*} (t) = \exp \left(\boldsymbol {v} \boldsymbol {h} _ {i - 1} + w \left(t - t _ {i - 1}\right) + b\right), \tag {12}
$$

where  $\pmb{v}$ ,  $w$  and  $b$  are trainable parameters. Combining Eqs. (10) and (12), we can obtain a closed-form expression for  $f^{*}(t)$

$$
f ^ {*} (t) = \exp \left(\boldsymbol {v} \boldsymbol {h} _ {i - 1} + w \left(t - t _ {i - 1}\right) + b + \frac {1}{w} \left(\exp \left(\boldsymbol {v} \boldsymbol {h} _ {j - 1} + b\right) - \exp \left(\boldsymbol {v} \boldsymbol {h} _ {j - 1} + w \left(t - t _ {j - 1}\right) + b\right)\right)\right). \tag {13}
$$

By maximizing this likelihood on the training data, we can estimate of the conditional distribution of the time intervals. To obtain a point estimate of the time interval till the next event, we compute the expectation under Eq. (13) numerically.

Du et al. (2016) also applies the same approach, but the history embedding  $\pmb{h}_{i-1}$  is computing by a regular RNN. CCNN, with its improved processing of nonuniform data, is expected to produce a better history embedding, and thereby a better estimate of the time intervals.

# 4.6 SUMMARY AND GENERALIZATION

Fig. 2 illustrates the structure of a CCNN layer. To sum up, the kernel network and bias network learn the continuous kernel and bias as functions of  $t$ ,  $\mathcal{I}_{\mathrm{in}}$  and  $\mathcal{X}_{\mathrm{in}}$ . The main network applies these functions to produce the output according to Eq. (3). The hyperparameters include  $O_K$  (Eq. (4)),  $L_K$  (Eq. (5)),  $O_B$  (Eq.(6)) and  $\delta$  (Eq. (8)).

It is worth highlighting that CCNN not only accommodates arbitrary input time stamps, it can also produce output at any output time stamps, by simply adjusting the value of  $t$  in Eqs. (3), (4) and (6). So a CCNN layer can accept input at a set of time stamps, and produces output at a different set of time stamps, which is very useful for resampling, interpolation and continuous sequence prediction.

When the inputs  $x(t_{i})$  and output  $y(t)$  need to be multidimensional, according to Eq. (3),  $K(\cdot)$  and  $\beta (\cdot)$  become vectors or matrices with matching dimensions. Therefore, we simply need to adapt the output of the kernel and the bias networks from scalars to vectors or vectorized matrices. Also, a multi-layer CCNN can be constructed by stacking individual CCNN layers, with the input time stamps of a layer matching the output time stamps of its previous layer.

# 5 EVALUATION

In this section, CCNN is evaluated on a set of prediction tasks on both simulated and realworld data.

# 5.1 PREDICTING SIGNAL VALUE ON SIMULATED DATA

The prediction task predicts the next sample  $x(t_{N + 1})$ , given the previous nonuniform samples  $x(t_1)\dots x(t_N)$ .

Datasets The synthetic datasets are generated by unevenly sampling from three standard time series: Sine, Mackey-Glass(MG) and Lorenz. The details of the time series are introduced in Appendix C.1

Baselines The following algorithms are compared:

- CCNN: The proposed algorithm. The first layer is a CCNN layer which takes both the sampling time intervals and the signal sequence. After the CCNN layer, the sequence is resampled onto a

uniform time interval. For predicting future label, signal value, and interval, the CCNN is configured using only past value, i.e. CCNN kernel has non-zero value only when  $t' - L_K < t_i < t'$ , shown in Fig. 1. The time information is either two-hot encoded (Adams et al., 2010) (CCNN-th), or not encoded (CCNN).

- CNN: data are directly fed into a regular CNN, with no special handling of nonuniform sampling.  
- CNNT: The sampling time intervals are appended to the input data, which are fed to a regular CNN. The time information is either two-hot encoded (CNNT-th), or not encoded (CNNT).  
- ICNN: data are interpolated to be uniform before being fed to a regular CNN. Piecewise Constnat (ICNN-P), linear (ICNN-L), quadratic (ICNN-Q), cubic spline (ICNN-C) and sinc (ICNN-S) interpolation algorithms are implemented.  
- RNNT: the sampling time intervals are appended to the input data, then are fed into a vanilla RNN. The time information is either two-hot encoded (RNNT-th), or not encoded (RNNT).

All the networks have two layers with ReLU activations in the hidden layers and no activations in the output layer. For CNN, ICNN and CNNT, the convolution kernel length of each layer is set to 7. For ICNN, the input signal is interpolated at time stamps  $t_{N + 1} - k$ ,  $k = 1, \dots, 13$  to form a uniform sequence before feeding into two-layers regular CNN. For CCNN, the output time stamps of the first layer are  $t_{N + 1} - k$ ,  $k = 1, \dots, 13$ . The kernel length  $L_K = 3$ . Since its input is uniform, the second layer of CCNN is a regular convolutional layer, with kernel length 7. These configurations ensure that all the neural networks have the same expected receptive field size of 13.

The rest of the hyperparameters are set such that all the networks have comparable number of parameters, as in Appendix C.2. All the networks are trained with Adam optimizer Kingma & Ba (2014) and mean squared error (MSE) loss. The training batch size is 20. The number of training steps is determined by validation. The validation set size is 10,000.

Results and Analysis Table  $1^{1}$  lists the MSEs. There are three observations. First, CCNN-th outperforms the other baselines in terms of prediction accuracy. Notice that the number of convolution channels of CCNN are significantly smaller than most of the other baselines, in order to match the number of parameters. Nevertheless, the advantage in properly dealing with the nonuniform sampling still offsets the reduction in channels in most tasks. Second, interpolation methods (ICNNs and CCNN) generally outperform the other baselines, particularly CNNT. This again shows that interpolation is more reasonable for dealing with nonuniform time series than simply appending the time intervals. Furthermore, preset interpolation algorithms (ICNNs) can rarely match CCNN that has the flexibility to learn its own interpolation kernel. Third, two-hot encoding usually improves the performance. Again, there are fewer channels with two-hot encoding in order to match model complexity, but the advantage of two-hot encoding still stands out.

Kernel Analysis In order to visualize the learned continuous kernels  $K(t - t_i; \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{in}}, \mathcal{X}_{\mathrm{in}})$ , we set the CCNN network has the same configuration except CCNN filter number is 1, and is trained separately with nonuniformly sampled  $(\lambda = 1)$  sine signals with  $T = 4, 5, 6, 7$ . The learned continuous kernel function is quite interpretable. Each kernel is a sine-like function with estimated period equaling the underlying signal period shown in Fig. 4

# 5.2 PREDICTING TIME INTERVALS TO NEXT EVENT

We then evaluate CCNN on realworld data to predict the time intervals to the next event.

Datasets and Configurations Four time series datasets with nonuniform time intervals are introduced, i.e. NYSE, Stackoverflow², MIMIC ((Johnson et al., 2016)) and Retweet ((Zhao et al., 2015)). Detailed information are provided in Appendix C.3. The input sequence is the time stamps and the one-hot encoded types of a series of events. The task is to predict the time interval till the next event of a specific type, given the previous events. As mentioned in Sec. 4.5, following the design in (Du et al., 2016), the input sequence is assumed to be generated via an underlying marked TPP, where the time stamps follow a TPP, and the marker, i.e. the type of the event, is generated from a multinomial distribution conditioned on history. The output of the networks is a condition intensity function  $\lambda^{*}(t)$

Figure 5: Example predicted time intervals, which is the expectation over Eq. (10) (upper) and RMSE (lower) on the predicting time interval to next event (section 5.2). Standard deviation is calculated among 5 train-test-validation splits. Retweet dataset has only one split so no standard deviation is reported. N-SM-MPP did not report RMSE on retweet dataset.

as in Eq. (12). The loss function is the log-likelihood of training set as in (Du et al., 2016). As the model prediction, the expected duration is computed numerically from the estimated conditional distribution. The evaluation metric is the MSE of the expected duration and the actual duration to the next event. Configurations of all the models are the same as in previous experiments except that: the one-hot encoded event types,  $\{x(t_i)\}$ , are first passed through an embedding layer, which is a  $1 \times 1$  convolutional layer with a channel dimension of 8, and the resulting embedded vectors are then fed into the networks.

This task is a causal task, where current output should not depend on future input. Therefore, the CCNN configuration is adapted to the causal setting, as discussed in section 4.3.

Baselines We benchmark with two baselines specialized for this type of tasks, Recurrent Marked Temporal Point Process (RMTPP) (Du et al., 2016) and N-SM-MPP (Mei & Eisner, 2017). N-SM-MPP is the current state-of-the-art deep learning method. For NYSE, StackOverflow and MIMIC, we directly compare to the results (Mei & Eisner, 2017) reported, and re-inplemented RMTPP to benchmark ReTweet. Configurations for CCNNs are provided in Appendix C.4.

Results and Analysis Fig. 5 shows the estimated event interval (expectation of Eq. (10)) and RMSEs. The upper plots show that the predicted interval aligns well with ground truth and result in smaller RMSE in MIMIC and Retweet dataset. In NYSE and StackOverflow, though the ground truth shows extremely fluctuation on event intervals and CCNNs fail to predict accurately as in MIMIC and Retweet, the predicted interval still tends to capture the increase and decrease trend. The lower plots compare the RMSE with the baselines. CCNN algorithms outperformed two baselines in all datasets. There is a slight advantage of CCNN-th over CCNN, which verifies the effectiveness of two-hot encoding.

# 5.3 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS

Two additional experiments on real-world data, which are prediction on Data Market and interpolation on speech, are presented in Appendix D.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have introduced CCNN for nonuniform time series with two takeaways. First, interpolation before continuous convolution is shown to be a reasonable way for nonuniform time series. Second, learning task specific kernels in a data-driven way significantly improves the performance. There are two promising directions. First, we have focused on 1D convolution, but this framework can be generalized to multi-dimensional nonuniform data. Second, while the computational complexity is similar for CCNN and CNN, the runtime of the former is much longer, because of the lack of parallelization. Fast implementation of CCNN is thus another research direction.
