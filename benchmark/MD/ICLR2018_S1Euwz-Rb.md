# ABSTRACT

We present Compositional Attention Networks (CANs), a novel fully differentiable neural network architecture, designed to facilitate explicit and expressive reasoning. While many types of neural networks are effective at learning and generalizing from massive quantities of data, this model moves away from monolithic black-box architectures towards a design that provides a strong prior for iterative reasoning, enabling it to support explainable and structured learning, as well as generalization from a modest amount of data. The model builds on the great success of existing recurrent cells such as LSTMs: It sequences a single recurrent Memory, Attention, and Control (MAC) cell, and by careful design imposes structural constraints on the operation of each cell and the interactions between them, incorporating explicit control and soft attention mechanisms into their interfaces. We demonstrate the model's strength and robustness on the challenging CLEVR dataset for visual reasoning, achieving a new state-of-the-art  $98.9\%$  accuracy, halving the error rate of the previous best model. More importantly, we show that the new model is more computationally efficient, data-efficient, and requires an order of magnitude less time and/or data to achieve good results.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

This paper considers how best to design neural networks to perform the iterative reasoning necessary for complex problem solving. Putting facts and observations together to arrive at conclusions is a central necessary ability as we work to move neural networks beyond their current great success with sensory perception tasks (LeCun et al., 1998; Krizhevsky et al., 2012) towards displaying Artificial General Intelligence.

Concretely, we develop a novel model for the CLEVR dataset (Johnson et al., 2016) for visual question answering (VQA). VQA (Antol et al., 2015; Gupta, 2017) is a challenging multimodal task that requires responding to natural language questions about images. However, Agrawal et al. (2016) shows how the first generation of successful models on VQA tasks tend to acquire only superficial comprehension of both the image and the question, exploiting dataset biases rather than capturing a sound perception and reasoning process that would lead to the correct answer (Sturm, 2014). CLEVR was created to address this problem. As illustrated in figure 1, instances in the dataset consist of rendered images featuring 3D objects of several shapes, colors, materials and sizes, coupled with unbiased, compositional questions that require an array of challenging reasoning skills such as following transitive relations, counting objects and comparing their properties, without allowing any shortcuts around such reasoning. Importantly, each instance in

CLEVR is also accompanied by a tree-structured functional program that was both used to construct the question and reflects a reasoning procedure – a series of predefined operations that can be composed together to answer it.

Many neural networks are essentially very large correlation engines that will hone in on any statistical (or spurious) pattern that allows them to model the observed data more accurately. In contrast,

Figure 1: A sample instance from the CLEVR dataset, with a question: "There is a purple cube that is behind of a metal object right to a large ball; what material is it?"

we seek to create a model structure that requires combining sound inference steps in solving a problem instance. At the other extreme, some approaches adopt symbolic structures that resemble the expression trees of programming languages to perform reasoning (Andreas et al., 2016b; Hu et al., 2017). In particular, some approaches to CLEVR use the supplied functional programs for supervised or semi-supervised training (Andreas et al., 2016a; Johnson et al., 2017). Not only do we wish to avoid using such supervision in our work, but we in general suspect that the rigidity of these structures and the use of an inventory of operation-specific neural modules undermines robustness and generalization, and at any rate requires the use of more complex reinforcement learning methods.

To address these weaknesses, while still seeking use of a sound and transparent underlying reasoning process, we propose Compositional Attention Networks (CANs), a novel, fully differentiable, non-modular architecture for reasoning tasks. A CAN is a straightforward recurrent neural network with attention; the novelty lies in the use of a new Memory, Attention and Composition (MAC) cell. The constrained and deliberate design of the MAC cell was developed as a kind of strong structural prior that encourages the network to solve problems by stringing together a sequence of transparent reasoning steps. MAC cells are versatile but constrained neural units. They explicitly separate out memory from control, both represented recurrently. The unit contains three subunits: The control unit updates the control representation based on outside instructions (for VQA, the question), learning to successively attend to different places in the instructions; the read unit gets stuff out of a knowledge base (for VQA, the image) based on the control signal and the previous memory; the write unit updates the memory based on soft self-attention to previous memories, controlled by what was retrieved and the control signal. A universal MAC unit with a single set of parameters is used throughout the reasoning process, but its behavior can vary widely based on the context in which it is applied – the input to the control unit (and the contents of the knowledge base). With attention, a CAN has the capacity to represent arbitrarily complex acyclic reasoning graphs (in a soft manner), while having physically sequential structure. The result is a continuous counterpart to module networks that can be trained end-to-end simply by backpropagation.

We test the behavior of our new network on CLEVR and its associated datasets. On the primary CLEVR reasoning task, we achieve an accuracy of  $98.9\%$ , halving the error rate compared to the previous state-of-the-art FiLM model (Perez et al., 2017). In particular, we show that our architecture yields better performance on questions involving counting and aggregation. In supplementary studies, we show that a CAN learns more quickly (in terms of number of training epochs and training time) and more effectively from limited amounts of training data. Moreover, it also achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of  $82.5\%$  on the more varied and difficult human-authored questions of the CLEVR-Humans dataset. The careful design of our cell encourages compositionality, versatility and transparency. We achieve these properties by defining attention-based interfaces that constrict input and output spaces, and constrain the interactions both between and inside cells in order to guide them towards simple reasoning behaviors. Although each cell's functionality has only a limited range of possible continuous reasoning behaviors, when chained together in a CAN, the whole system becomes expressive and powerful. In the future, we believe that this architecture will also prove beneficial for other multi-step reasoning and inference tasks, for instance in machine comprehension and textual question answering.

# 2 RELATED WORK

There have been several prominent models that address the CLEVR task. By and large they can be partitioned into two groups: module networks, which in practice have all used the strong supervision provided in the form of tree-structured functional programs that accompany each data instance, and large, relatively unstructured end-to-end differentiable networks that complement a fairly standard stack of CNNs with components that aid in performing reasoning tasks. In contrast to modular approaches (Andreas et al., 2016a;b; Hu et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2017), our model does not require additional supervision and makes use of a single computational cell chained in sequence (like an LSTM) rather than a collection of custom modules deployed in a less flexible tree structure. In contrast to augmented CNN approaches (Santoro et al., 2017; Perez et al., 2017), we suggest that our approach provides an ability for relational reasoning with better generalization capacity and higher computational efficiency. These approaches and other related work are discussed and contrasted in more detail in the supplementary material in section C.

# 3 COMPOSITIONAL ATTENTION NETWORKS

Compositional Neural Networks is an end-to-end architecture for question-answering tasks that sequentially performs an explicit reasoning process by stringing together small building blocks, called MAC cells, each is responsible for performing one reasoning step.

We now provide an overview of the model, and a detailed discussion of the MAC unit. The model is composed of three components: an Input unit, the core MAC network, and an output unit. A TensorFlow implementation of the network, along with pretrained models will be made publicly available.

In this paper we explore the model in the context of VQA. However, it should be noted that while the input and output units are naturally domain-specific and should be designed to fit the task at hand, the MAC network has been designed to be generic and more broadly applicable, and may prove useful in contexts beyond those explored in the paper, such as machine comprehension or question answering over knowledge bases, which in our belief is a promising avenue for future work.

# 3.1 THE INPUT UNIT

The input unit processes the raw inputs given to the system into distributed vector representations. It receives a text question (or in general, a query), and an image (or in general, a Knowledge Base (KB)) and processes each of them with a matching sub-unit, for the query and the KB, here a biLSTM and CNNs. More details can be found in the supplementary material, section A.

At the end of this stage, we get from the query subunit a series of biLSTM output states, which we refer to as contextual words,  $[cw_1,\dots ,cw_S]$ , where  $S$  is the length of the question. In addition, we get  $q = [\overline{cw_1},\overline{cw_S} ]$ , the concatenation of the hidden states from the backward and forward LSTM passes. We refer to  $q$  as the question representation. Furthermore, we get from the Knowledge-Base subunit a static representation of the knowledge base. For the case of VQA, it will be represented by a continuous matrix  $KB_{V}$  of dimension  $H,W,d$ , where  $H = W = 14$  are the height and width of the transformed image, corresponding to each of its regions.

# 3.2 THE MAC CELL

The MAC network, which is the heart of our model, chains a sequence of small building blocks, called MAC cells, each responsible for performing one reasoning step. The model is provided access to a Knowledge Base (KB), which is, for the specific case of VQA, the given image, and then upon receiving a query, i.e. a question, the model iteratively focuses, in  $p$  steps, on the query's various parts, each reflects in turn the current reasoning step, which we term the control. Consequently, guided by this control, it retrieves the relevant information from the KB, that is then passed to the next cell in a recurrent fashion.

Drawing inspiration from the Model-View-Controller paradigm used in software design and from the commonly exercised separation between control and data paths in computer architecture, the MAC cell is composed of three units: control unit, read unit and write unit. Each has a clearly defined role and an interface through which it interacts with the other units. See figure 2 (left).

The careful design and imposed interfaces that constrain the interaction between the units inside the MAC cell, as described below, serve as structural prior that limits the space of hypotheses it can learn, thereby guiding it towards acquiring the intended reasoning behaviors. As such, this prior facilitates the learning process and mitigate overfitting issues.

In particular, and similar in spirit to Perez et al. (2017), we allow the question to interact with the Knowledge Base – the image for the case of VQA, only through indirect means: by guiding the cell to attend to different elements in the KB, as well as controlling its operation through gating mechanisms. Thus, in both cases, the interaction between these mediums, visual and textual, or knowledge and query, is mediated through probability distributions, either in the form of attention map, or as a gate, further detailed below. This stands in stark contrast to many common approaches that fuse the question and image together into the same vector space through linear combinations, multiplication, or concatenation. Rather, our controlled interaction distills the influence that the query should have in processing the Knowledge Base, casting it onto discrete probability distributions instead.

The MAC cell has been designed to replace the discrete and predefined modules used in the modular approach (Andreas et al., 2016a;b; Hu et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2017). Rather, we create one uniform and versatile cell that is applied across all the reasoning steps, sharing both its architecture as well as its parameters, across all of its instantiations. In contrast to the discrete modules, each trained to specialize to some specific elementary reasoning task, the MAC cell is capable of demonstrating a continuous range of possible reasoning behaviors conditioned on the context in which it is applied – namely, the inputs it receives from the prior cell.

Each cell  $MAC_{i}$  maintains two states: control  $c_{i}$  and memory  $m_{i}$ , both are continuous vectors of dimension  $d$ . The control  $c_{i}$  represents the reasoning operation the MAC cell should accomplish in the current step – focusing only on some aspect of the whole question. This is represented by a weighted-average summing only the attended question words. The memory  $m_{i}$  represents the current context information deemed relevant to respond to the query, or answer the question. This is represented practically by a weighted average over elements from the KB, or for the case of VQA, regions of the image.  $m_{0}$  and  $c_{0}$  are initialized to a random vector parameter of dimension  $d$ . The memory and control states are passed from one cell to the next in a recurrent fashion, and used in a way reminiscent of Key-Value memory networks (Miller et al., 2016), as discussed below.

# 3.2.1 THE CONTROL UNIT

The control unit determines the reasoning operation that should be applied at this step. It receives the contextual words  $[cw_{1},\dots, cw_{S}]$ , the question representation  $q$ , and the control state from the previous MAC cell  $c_{i-1}$ , all of which are vectors of dimension  $d$ .

We would like to allow our MAC cell to perform continuously varied and adaptive range of behaviors, as demanded by the question. Therefore, we define the behavior of each cell to be a function of some of the contextual words  $[cw_1,\dots ,cw_S]$  that the control unit chooses to attend to at this step. This will allow the cell to adapt its behavior - the reasoning operation it performs - to the question it receives, instead of having a fixed set of predefined behaviours as is the case in competing approaches Andreas et al. (2016a;b); Johnson et al. (2017).

The formal specification of the control unit is shown in figure 2. The question  $q$  is linearly transformed into a vector  $q_{i}$  of the same dimension, which in turn is concatenated with the previous control state  $c_{i-1}$  and linearly transformed again to a  $d$ -dimensional vector  $cq_{i}$ .

$$
q _ {i} = \left(W _ {1} ^ {d, d}\right) _ {i} \cdot q + \left(b _ {1} ^ {d}\right) _ {i}
$$

$$
c q _ {i} = W _ {2} ^ {2 d, d} \left[ q _ {i}, c _ {i - 1} \right] + b _ {2} ^ {d}
$$

Note that in contrast to all other parameters of the cell, which are shared across its instantiations at the different steps  $i = 1,\dots ,p$ , the parameters  $\left(W_1^{d,d}\right)_i$  and  $\left(b_{1}^{d}\right)_{i}$  are different for each iteration.

This is done to allow each cell to attend more readily to different aspects of the questions, depending on the index of the current step – its relative position in the context of the whole reasoning process.

$c q_{i}$  represents the current reasoning operation we would like to perform in a continuous way, taking into account both the overall meaning of the question  $q_{i}$ , as well as the words the model attended to in the previous step,  $c_{i - 1}$ .

However, we would like to prevent the cell from diverging in the reasoning operations it tries to perform, and instead anchor it back in the question words, by using them to represent the reasoning operation of the current step. We can achieve that by computing an attention distribution  $cv_{i}$  over the contextual words  $[cw_{1},\dots ,cw_{S}]$  based on their similarity to a linear transformation of  $cq_{i}$ . Then, summing the contextual words according to the attention distribution  $cv_{i}$  will allow us to have a new control state,  $c_{i}$ , which is represented again in terms of words from the question. Intuitively, it is the gist of the question that is relevant to the reasoning operation we would like to perform in the current step.

$$
c v _ {i, s} = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(W _ {3} ^ {d, 1} \left(c q _ {s} \circ c w _ {s}\right) + b _ {3}\right)
$$

$$
c _ {i} = \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {S} c v _ {s} \cdot c w _ {s}
$$

Finally, the control unit returns the current control state  $c_{i}$ , along with an attention map  $cv_{i}$  over the contextual words.

# 3.2.2 THE READ UNIT

The Read Unit is provided with access to the knowledge base  $KB_{V}$ , along with the previous memory state  $m_{i-1}$  and the current control  $c_{i}$ . It is responsible for retrieving relevant content from the Knowledge Base  $KB_{V}$  for the reasoning task that the MAC cell should accomplish at this step, which is represented by the current control state  $c_{i}$ , as explained above. Figure 3 shows a diagram.

The relevance of the new information is judged in two stages by the relatedness of each element in the KB (or for the case of VQA, each region in the image) to either the memory  $m_{i-1}$  that has accumulated relevant information from previous iterations, or to the current control  $c_i$ , pointing towards the next piece of information that should be taken into account. Here, relatedness is measured by trained linear transformations comparing each element to the previous memory and the current control.

More formally, the interaction between each element  $KB_{h,w}$ , where  $h = 1,\dots,H,w = 1,\dots,W$  and the previous memory  $m_{i - 1}$  is computed by:

$$
\left(I _ {m - K B}\right) _ {h, w} = \left(W _ {4} ^ {d, d} m _ {i - 1} + b _ {4} ^ {d}\right) \circ \left(W _ {5} ^ {d, d} K B _ {h, w} + b _ {5} ^ {d}\right)
$$

These memory-KB interactions measure the relatedness of each element in the KB to the memory accumulated so far, which holds information that has been deemed relevant to handle previous

reasoning steps towards addressing the question. They allow the model to perform transitive inference, retrieving a new piece of information that now seems important in light of the recent memory retrieved in a prior iteration.

However, there are cases which necessitate the model to temporarily ignore current memories, when choosing the new information to retrieve. Logical OR is a classical example: when the model has to look at two different objects at the same time, and assuming it stored one of them at the first iteration, it should briefly ignore it, considering new information that is relevant to the question but is unrelated to the memory. In order to achieve such capability, the Read Unit concatenates the original KB elements to each corresponding memory-KB interaction, which are then projected back to  $d$ -dimensional space:

$$
\left(I _ {m - K B} ^ {\prime}\right) _ {h, w} = W _ {6} ^ {2 d, d} \left[ I _ {m - K B}, K B _ {h, w} \right] + b _ {6} ^ {d}
$$

Finally, the read unit compares the current  $c_{i}$  with these memory-KB interactions, in order to focus on the information that is relevant to the current reasoning operation that the MAC cell seeks to accomplish. The result is then passed to a softmax layer yielding an attention map  $m v_{i}$  over the KB, which is used in turn to retrieve the relevant information to perform the current reasoning step.

$$
\begin{array}{l} I _ {c m - K B} = c _ {i} \circ \left(I _ {m - K B} ^ {\prime}\right) _ {h, w} \\ (m v _ {i}) _ {h, w} = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(W _ {7} ^ {d, d} I _ {c m - K B} + b _ {7} ^ {d}\right) \\ m _ {i} = \sum_ {h, w = 1, 1} ^ {H, W} m v _ {i} \cdot K B _ {h, w} \\ \end{array}
$$

Finally, the read unit returns the newly retrieved information  $m_{new}$ , along with an attention map  $mv_{i}$  over the Knowledge Base.

To give an example of the Read Unit operation, assume a given question  $q$  such as "What object is located left to the blue ball?", whose associated answer is "cube". Initially, no cue is provided to the model to attend to that cube, since no direct information about it presents in the question. Instead, based on its comprehension of the question, the model may start by focusing on the blue ball at the first iteration, such that the memory state  $m_{1}$  will capture the blue ball. However, in the second iteration, the Control Unit, after re-examining the question, may realize it should now look left, storing the word "left" in  $c_{2}$ . Then, when considering both  $m_{1}$  and  $c_{2}$ , the Read Unit will realize it should perform a reasoning operation corresponding to the word "left" (stored in  $c_{2}$ ) given a memory representing the blue ball in  $m_{1}$ , thereby allowing it to look left to the blue ball and find the cube.

# 3.2.3 THE WRITE UNIT

The Write Unit is responsible for creating the new memory state  $m_{i}$  that will reflect all the informed considered to be important to answer the question so far, i.e. up to the current iteration in the reasoning process. It receives the last memory state  $m_{i-1}$  from the previous MAC cell, along with the newly retrieved information from the Read Unit in the current iteration,  $m_{\text{new}}$ . See figure 3 for a diagram.

In the most basic design we have explored, merging the new information with the previous memory state is done simply by a linear transformation.

$$
m _ {i} = W _ {8} ^ {2 d, d} [ m _ {n e w}, m _ {i - 1} ] + b _ {8} ^ {d}
$$

However, there are couple of problems with this basic way to merge memories which we address by modifying the Write Unit, as presented below.

Self-Attention. The current architecture that we have presented allows the model to perform reasoning steps in a sequence, passing control and memory states from one cell to the following. However, we would like to grant the system with more flexibility. Particularly, we would like to allow it

to capture more complicated reasoning processes such as trees and graphs - Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in particular, where several branches of reasoning sub-processes are merged together in later stages. Indeed, the CLEVR dataset includes cases where the questions embody tree-like reasoning process, rather than just sequences, which we would like to address correctly in our model.

Modular networks approach this task by dynamically building a tailor-made tree layout to fit the given question. However, this results in non-differentiability of their overall model, since the layout-prediction task is discrete. In contrast to this approach, we would like to retain the end-to-end differentiability of our model, having universal physically static but versatile layout that will be able to capture any required reasoning layout.

We achieve this by adding self-attention connections between each MAC cell and all the prior cells. Since each cell can look on all the prior reasoning steps and their corresponding memories retrieved from the Knowledge Base, it can virtually capture any directed acyclic graph, while still having physically sequential layout.

More formally, the current MAC cell, of the  $i^{th}$  iteration, is granted with access to  $c_{1},\ldots ,c_{i - 1}$  along with the corresponding  $m_{1},\ldots ,m_{i - 1}$ , that have been computed by the prior MAC cells. It begins by computing the similarity between  $c_{i}$  and  $c_{1},\ldots ,c_{i - 1}$ , and use it to derive an attention map over the prior MAC cells  $SA_{i,j}$  for  $j = 1,\dots,i - 1$ . This represents the relevance of the  $j^{th}$  prior reasoning step to the current one  $i$ .

$$
S A _ {i j} = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(W _ {9} ^ {d, 1} \left(c _ {i} \circ c _ {j}\right) + b _ {9}\right)
$$

Then, we average the previous memories according to this resulted attention map  $SA_{ij}$ . We obtain  $m_{sa}$ , representing the information from all the other reasoning steps that is relevant to the current one.

$$
(m _ {s a}) _ {i} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {i - 1} s a _ {i, j} \cdot m _ {j}
$$

This resembles the approach of Key-Value networks (Miller et al., 2016). The similarity between control states, corresponding to the reasoning operations that are performed in each prior step, allows the model to select which memories should be taken into account, when creating the new memory – namely, which branches of the reasoning process should be merged together at this point.

Finally, we use  $m_{sa}$  along with  $m_{i-1}$  and  $m_{new}$ , to compute  $m_i$ , similarly to what has been done in the basic Write Unit, presented before.

$$
m _ {i} = W _ {1 0} ^ {3 d, d} [ m _ {n e w}, m _ {i - 1}, m _ {s a} ] + b _ {1 0} ^ {d}
$$

Memory Gate. The currently presented MAC network has some fixed number  $N$  of concatenated MAC cells, representing the length of the overall reasoning process we perform. However, not all questions require reasoning process of the same length. Some questions are simpler while others more complex.

In order to let our network support questions with varied complexities, we add a gate over the new memory computed at each step, that may keep its previous value  $m_{i-1}$  unchanged. That way, the MAC network may skip steps when necessary – when the question demands short reasoning process – bypassing those memories intact further along the network. Overall, the gating mechanism confers the MAC network with the ability to adjust the length of the reasoning process to the complexity of the given question.

Practically, the gate functions in a similar way to a highway network (Srivastava et al., 2015), where the gate value is conditioned on the current reasoning operation,  $c_{i}$ .

$$
m _ {i} = W _ {8} ^ {2 d, d} [ m _ {n e w}, m _ {i - 1} ] + b _ {8} ^ {d}
$$

$$
m _ {i} = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(c _ {i}\right) \cdot m _ {i - 1} + \left(1 - \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(c _ {i}\right)\right) \cdot m _ {i} ^ {\prime}
$$

The write unit returns the new memory state  $m_{i}$ , that will be passed along with  $c_{i}$  to the next MAC cell.

# 3.2.4 DISCUSSION

Overall, when designing the MAC cell, we have attempted to model and formulate the inner workings of an elementary, yet generic reasoning skills: the model decomposes the problem into steps, focusing on one at a time. At each such step, it takes into account:

- The control  $c_{i}$ : Some aspect of the task - pointing to the future work that has left to be done.  
- The previous memory  $m_{i - 1}$ : The partial solution or evidence the cell has acquired so far – pointing to the past work that has already been achieved.  
- The newly retrieved information  $m_{new}$ : that is retrieved from the knowledge base  $KB$  and may or may not be transitively related to that partial solution or evidence - the present, or current work.

Considering these three sources of information together, the cell finally adds the new information up into its working memory,  $m_{i}$ , progressing one more step towards the final answer.

Indeed, section 4 shows clear evidence that our architecture serves as a strong prior allowing the model to learn much faster, and generalize from smaller amounts of data than competing approaches.

Furthermore, we would like to stress that our architecture can handle datasets more diverse than CLEVR, and does not assume that the data has the specific properties of this dataset. Indeed, in section 4 we demonstrate that our model is robust to linguistic variations and diverse vocabulary that may demand unconfined variety of reasoning processes. This is substantiated by its state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVR-humans dataset, which features crowd-sourced natural language questions on the given image.

# 3.3 THE OUTPUT UNIT

The output unit receives the question representation  $q$ , along with the memory state passed from the last MAC cell  $m_{i}$  for  $i = p$ , where  $p$  is the number of MAC cells in the network – representing the number of reasoning steps in the whole process. It inspects both and predicts an answer based on their concatenation. Intuitively, we would like our model to consider both the question as well as the relevant information that has been progressively retrieved from the KB, deemed the necessary information to answer it.

Note that considering both  $q$  and  $m_{i=p}$  is critical to answer the question. While  $m_{i=p}$  represents the information collected from KB, we still need to recall what has been asked about it to be able to answer accordingly. This is especially true in our case, when all other interactions between the question and the KB, are mediated through attention distributions, rather than being transformed into a shared continuous vector space.

The prediction is built out of a standard 2-layers fully-connected softmax-based classifier with hidden dimension  $d$  and output dimension that matches the number of possible answers in the dataset. The classifier receives  $[m_p, q]$  as input and returns a probability distribution over the answers.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate our model on the recent CLEVR dataset (Johnson et al., 2016). CLEVR is a synthetic dataset consisting of 700K tuples; each consists of a 3D-rendered image featuring objects of various shapes, colors, materials and sizes, coupled with compositional multi-step questions that measure performance on an array of challenging reasoning skills such as following transitive relations, counting objects and comparing their properties. In addition, each question is associated with a formal program, specifying the reasoning operations that should be performed to compute the answer, among 28 possibilities.

We first perform experiments on the original 700k CLEVR dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), comparing to prior work. As shown in table 1, our model matches or outperforms all existing models both in overall accuracy, as well as in each category, testing different reasoning skills. In particular, for the overall performance, we achieve  $98.94\%$  accuracy, more than halving the error rate of the prior best model, FiLM (Perez et al., 2017).

Counting and Numerical Comparison. Remarkably, our performance on questions testing counting and numerical comparisons is significantly higher than the competing models, which consistently struggle on this question type. Again, we nearly halve the corresponding error rate. These results demonstrate the aptitude of attention mechanisms to perform counting, reduction and aggregation, in contrast to alternative, CNN-based approaches.

Training Length and Computational-Efficiency. We examine the learning curves of our and competing models. As shown in figure 4, our model learns significantly faster than the other leading methods, FiLM (Perez et al., 2017) and PG+EE (Johnson et al., 2017). While we do not have learning curves for the Relational Network model, Santoro et al. (2017) report approximately 1.4 million iterations to achieve  $95.5\%$  accuracy, which are equivalent to 125 epochs approximately, whereas our model achieves a comparable accuracy after 3 epochs only, yielding  $50x$  reduction in the length of the training process.

Naturally, the smaller number of required training steps also translates to comparably shorter training time. Perez et al. (2017) report training time of 4 days, equivalent to 80 epochs, to reach accuracy of  $97.7\%$ . In contrast, we achieve higher accuracy in 6 epochs, taking 9.5 hours overall, leading to  $10\mathrm{x}$  reduction in training time.

# 4.1 DATA EFFICIENCY

We have explored the performance of our and other leading approaches on smaller subsets of the CLEVR dataset, in order to study the ability of models to generalize from smaller amount of data. We sampled at random subsets of CLEVR, with  $10\%$ ,  $25\%$  and  $50\%$  of its original 700k size, and used them to train our and other 3 proposed models for the CLEVR task: FiLM

(Perez et al., 2017), the strongly-supervised PG+EE (Johnson et al., 2017), and stacked-attention networks (Johnson et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016).

As shown in figure 4, our model outperforms the other models by a wide margin for all subsets of the CLEVR dataset. For  $50\%$  of the data, equivalent to 350k samples, other models obtain accuracies ranging between  $70\%$  and  $92\%$ , while our model achieves  $97.9\%$ . The gap becomes larger as the dataset size reduces: for  $25\%$  of the data, equivalent to 175k samples, performance of other models is between  $50\%$  and  $77\%$ , while our model maintains a high  $95.4\%$  accuracy.

Finally, for  $10\%$  of the data - 70k samples, still a sizeable amount - our model is the only one that manages to generalize, with performance of  $86\%$ , whereas the other three models completely fail, achieving  $51.6\%$  at best. Note that as pointed out by (Johnson et al., 2016) a simple baseline that predicts the most frequent answer for each of the question types achieves already  $42.1\%$ , suggesting that answering half of the questions correctly means that the competing models barely learn to generalize from the smaller dataset. These results demonstrate the robustness of our architecture and its key role as a structural prior guiding our network to learn the intended reasoning skills.

# 4.2 CLEVR HUMANS - NATURAL LANGUAGE QUESTIONS

We analyze our model performance on the CLEVR-Humans dataset (Johnson et al., 2017), consisting of natural language questions collected through crowdsourcing. As such, the dataset has diverse vocabulary and linguistic variations, and it also demands more varied reasoning skills.

Since the training set is relatively small, consisting of 18k samples, we use it to finetune a model pretrained on the standard CLEVR dataset. However, since most of the vocabulary in CLEVR-Humans is not covered by CLEVR, we do not train the word vectors during the pre-training stage, so to prevent drift in their meaning compared to other uncovered words in CLEVR-Humans that may be semantically related.

As shown in table 2, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-Humans both before and after fine-tuning. It surpasses the next-best FiLM model, (Perez et al., 2017) by  $6.6\%$  percent, achieving  $82.5\%$ .

The results substantiate the model's robustness against linguistic variations and noise, as well as its ability to adapt to diverse vocabulary and varied reasoning skills. Arguably, the soft attention performed over the question words allows the model to focus on the words that are most critical to answer the question and translate them to corresponding reasoning operations, giving less attention to irrelevant linguistic variations.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We have given a first demonstration of how a sequence of Memory, Attention and Control (MAC) cells combined into a Compositional Attention Network (CAN) provides a very effective tool for neural reasoning. In future work, we wish to explore this promising architecture for other tasks and domains, including real-world VQA, machine comprehension and textual question answering.
