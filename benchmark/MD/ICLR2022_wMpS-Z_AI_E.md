# ABSTRACT

An important characteristic of neural networks is their ability to learn representations of the input data with effective features for prediction, which is believed to be a key factor to their superior empirical performance. To better understand the source and benefit of feature learning in neural networks, we consider learning problems motivated by practical data, where the labels are determined by a set of class relevant patterns and the inputs are generated from these along with some background patterns. We prove that neural networks trained by gradient descent can succeed on these problems. The success relies on the emergence and improvement of effective features, which are learned among exponentially many candidates efficiently by exploiting the data (in particular, the structure of the input distribution). In contrast, no linear models on data-independent features of polynomial sizes can learn to as good errors. Furthermore, if the specific input structure is removed, then no polynomial algorithm in the Statistical Query model can learn even weakly. These results provide theoretical evidence showing that feature learning in neural networks depends strongly on the input structure and leads to the superior performance. Our preliminary experimental results on synthetic and real data also provide positive support.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Various empirical studies have shown that an important characteristic of neural networks is their feature learning ability, i.e., to learn a feature mapping for the inputs which allow accurate prediction (e.g., Zeiler & Fergus 2014); Girshick et al. (2014); Zhang et al. (2019); Manning et al. (2020)). This is widely believed to be a key factor to their remarkable success in many applications, in particular, an advantage over traditional machine learning methods. To understand their success, it is then crucial to understand the source and benefit of feature learning in neural networks. Empirical observations show that networks can learn neurons that correspond to different semantic patterns in the inputs (e.g., eyes, bird shapes, tires, etc. in images (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Girshick et al., 2014)). Moreover, recent progress (e.g., Caron et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2020b; He et al. 2020; Jing & Tian 2020)) shows that one can even learn a feature mapping using only unlabeled inputs and then learn an accurate predictor (usually a linear function) on it using labeled data. This further demonstrates the feature learning ability of neural networks and that these input distributions contain important information for learning useful features. These empirical observations strongly suggest that the structure of the input distribution is crucial for feature learning and feature learning is crucial for the strong performance. However, it is largely unclear how practical training methods (gradient descent or its variants) learn important patterns from the inputs and whether this is necessary for obtaining the superior performance, since the empirical studies do not exclude the possibility that some other training methods can achieve similar performance without feature learning or with feature learning that does not exploit the input structure. Rigorous theoretical investigations are thus needed for answering these fundamental questions: How can effective features emerge from inputs in the training dynamics of gradient descent? Is learning features from inputs necessary for the superior performance?

Compared to the abundant empirical evidence, the theoretical understanding still remains largely open. One line of work (e.g. Jacot et al. (2018); Li & Liang (2018); Du et al. (2019); Allen-Zhu et al.

(2019); Chizat et al. (2019); Cao et al. (2020) and many others) shows in certain regime, sufficiently overparameterized networks are approximately linear models, i.e., a linear function on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This falls into the traditional approach of linear models on fixed features, which also includes random features (Rahimi & Recht, 2008) and other kernel methods (Kamath et al., 2020). The kernel viewpoint thus does not explain feature learning in networks nor the advantage over fixed features. A recent line of work (e.g. Daniely & Malach (2020); Bai & Lee (2019); Ghorbani et al. (2020); Yehudai & Shamir (2019); Allen-Zhu & Li (2019; 2020a); Li et al. (2020); Malach et al. (2021) and others) shows examples where neural networks provably enjoy the advantage over fixed features, under different settings and assumptions. While providing insightful results on the separation of the two approaches, they have not investigated whether the input structure is a crucial factor for feature learning and thus the advantage. Also, most studies have not analyzed how gradient descent can learn important input patterns as effective features, or rely on strong assumptions like models or data atypical in practice (e.g., special networks, Gaussian data, etc).

Towards a more thorough understanding, we propose to analyze learning problems motivated by practical data, where the labels are determined by a set of class-relevant patterns and the inputs are generated from these along with some background patterns. We use comparison for our study: (1) by comparing network learning with fixed feature approaches on these problems, we analyze the emergence of effective features and demonstrate feature learning leads to the advantage over fixed features; (2) by comparing these problems to those with the input structure removed, we demonstrate that the input structure is crucial for feature learning and prediction performance.

More precisely, we obtain the following results. We first prove that two-layer networks trained by gradient descent can efficiently learn to small errors on these problems, and then prove that no linear models on fixed features of polynomial sizes can learn to as good errors. These two results thus establish the provable advantage of networks and implies that feature learning leads to this advantage. More importantly, our analysis reveals the dynamics of feature learning: the network first learns a rough approximation of the effective features, then improves them to get a set of good features, and finally learns an accurate classifier on these features. Notably, the improvement of the effective features in the second phase is needed for obtaining the provable advantage. The analysis also reveals the emergence and improvement of the effective features are by exploiting the data, and in particular, they rely on the input structure. To formalize this, we further prove the third result: if the specific input structure is removed and replaced by a uniform distribution, then no polynomial algorithm can even weakly learn in the Statistical Query (SQ) learning model, not to mention the advantage over fixed features. Since SQ learning includes essentially all known algorithms (in particular, mini-batch stochastic gradient descent used in practice), this implies that feature learning depends strongly on the input structure. Finally, we perform simulations on synthetic data to verify our results. We also perform experiments on real data and observe similar phenomena, which show that our analysis provides useful insights for the practical network learning.

Our analysis then provides theoretical support for the following principle: feature learning in neural networks depends strongly on the input structure and leads to the superior performance. In particular, our results make it explicit that learning features from the input structure is crucial for the superior performance. This suggests that input-distribution-free analysis (e.g., traditional PAC learning) may not be able to explain the practical success, and advocates an emphasis of the input structure in the analysis. While these results are for our proposed problem setting and network learning in practice can be more complicated, the insights obtained match existing empirical observations and are supported by our experiments. The compelling evidence hopefully can attract more attention to further studies on modeling the input structure and analyzing feature learning.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and Linearization of Neural Networks. One line of work explains the success of sufficiently over-parameterized neural network by connecting them to linear methods like NTK (e.g. Jacot et al. (2018); Li & Liang (2018); Matthews et al. (2018); Lee et al. (2019); Novak et al. (2019); Yang (2019); Du et al. (2019); Allen-Zhu et al. (2019); Ji & Telgarsky (2019); Cao et al. (2020); Geiger et al. (2020); Chizat et al. (2019) and more). Though their approaches are different, they all base on the observation that when the neural network is sufficiently large, the weight of the neurons stays closed to the initialization during the training. In this situation, training with gradient

descent appears no different from solving a kernel method problem. This view is typically referred to as the NTK regime, or lazy training, or linearization. However, neural networks used in practice are usually not large enough to enter this regime, and the neurons are frequently observed to traverse instead of staying close to their initialization during the training process. Furthermore, in this regime, network learning is essentially the traditional approach of linear methods over fixed features, which cannot establish or explain feature learning and the advantage of network learning.

Advantage of Neural Networks over Linear Models on Fixed Features. Since the benign network learning results via gradient descent are not well explained by the NTK view, a recent line of work has turned to show learning settings where neural networks provably have advantage over linear models on fixed features (e.g. Daniely & Malach (2020); Refinetti et al. (2021); Malach et al. (2021); Dou & Liang (2020); Bai & Lee (2019); Ghorbani et al. (2020); Allen-Zhu & Li (2019); see the nice summary in Malach et al. (2021)). While formally establishing the advantages of network learning over fixed feature approaches, they have not answered the two fundamental questions this work focuses on; in particular, they have not studied whether the input structure is a crucial factor for feature learning and thus the advantage. For example, Ghorbani et al. (2020) show the advantage of networks in approximation power and Dou & Liang (2020) show their statistical advantage, but they do not consider the learning dynamics (i.e., how the training method obtains the good network). Allen-Zhu & Li (2019) prove the advantage of the networks for PAC learning with labels given by a depth-2 ResNet and Allen-Zhu & Li (2020a) prove for Gaussian inputs with labels given by a multiple-layer network, while neither considers the influence of the input structure on feature learning or the advantage. Daniely & Malach (2020) prove the advantage of the networks for the task of learning sparse parities on specifically designed input distributions that help the gradient descent learn effective features for prediction, and Malach et al. (2021) consider similar learning problems but with specifically designed differentiable models. On the other hand, neither study explores if the input structure is needed for the learning, and the data distributions and models are also atypical in practice, while our setting better connects to the practice. More technical discussions can be found in Appendix A.

There are also other theoretical studies on feature learning in networks (e.g. Yehudai & Ohad (2020); Zhou et al. (2021); Diakonikolas et al. (2020); Frei et al. (2020)), which however do not directly relate feature learning to the input structure or the advantage.

# 3 PROBLEM SETUP

To motivate our setup, consider images with various kinds of patterns like lines and circles. Some patterns are relevant for the labels while others are not; if the image contains a sufficient number of the former, then we are confident that the image belongs to a certain class. Dictionary learning, or sparse coding (e.g. Olshausen & Field (1997); Vinje & Gallant (2000); Blei et al. (2003); Yang et al. (2009)) is a classic model of such data. We thus model the patterns as a dictionary, generate a hidden vector indicating the presence of the patterns, and generate the input and label from this vector.

Let  $\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d$  be the input space, and  $\mathcal{Y} = \{\pm 1\}$  be the label space. Suppose  $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times D}$  is an unknown dictionary with  $D$  columns that can be regarded as patterns. For simplicity, assume  $M$  is orthonormal. Let  $\tilde{\phi} \in \{0,1\}^D$  be a hidden vector that indicates the presence of each pattern. Let  $A \subseteq [D]$  be a subset of size  $k$  corresponding to the class relevant patterns. Then the input is generated by  $M\tilde{\phi}$ , and the label can be any binary function on the number of class relevant patterns. More precisely, let  $P \subseteq [k]$ . We first sample  $\tilde{\phi}$  from a distribution  $\mathcal{D}_{\tilde{\phi}}$ , and then generate the input  $\tilde{x}$  and the class label  $y$  from  $\tilde{\phi}, A, P$ :

$$
\tilde {\phi} \sim \mathcal {D} _ {\tilde {\phi}}, \quad \tilde {x} = M \tilde {\phi}, \quad y = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} + 1, & \text {i f} \sum_ {i \in A} \tilde {\phi} _ {i} \in P, \\ - 1, & \text {o t h e r w i s e .} \end{array} \right. \tag {1}
$$

Learning with Input Structure. We allow quite general  $\mathcal{D}_{\tilde{\phi}}$  with the following assumptions:

(A0) The class probabilities are balanced:  $\operatorname*{Pr}[\sum_{i\in A}\tilde{\phi}_i\in P] = 1 / 2.$  
(A1) The patterns in  $A$  are correlated with the labels: for any  $i\in A$ ,  $\gamma = \mathbb{E}[y\tilde{\phi}_i] - \mathbb{E}[y]\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\phi}_i] > 0$ .  
(A2) Each pattern outside  $A$  is independent of all other patterns and identically distributed. Let  $p_{\mathrm{o}} \coloneqq \operatorname{Pr}[\tilde{\phi}_{i} = 1] \leq 1/2$  denote the probability they appear.

Let  $\mathcal{D}(A, P, \mathcal{D}_{\tilde{\phi}})$  denote the distribution on  $(\tilde{x}, y)$  corresponding to some  $A, P,$  and  $\mathcal{D}_{\tilde{\phi}}$ . Given parameters  $\Xi = (d, D, k, \gamma, p_{0})$ , the family  $\mathcal{F}_{\Xi}$  of distributions for learning is the set of all  $\mathcal{D}(A, P, \mathcal{D}_{\tilde{\phi}})$  with  $A \subseteq [D]$ ,  $P \subseteq [k]$ , and  $\mathcal{D}_{\tilde{\phi}}$  satisfying the above assumptions. Appendix F presents results for more general settings (e.g., incoherent dictionary, unbalanced classes, etc.). Our learning problems here already include some interesting special cases:

Example 1. Suppose  $k$  is odd, and  $P = \{i \in [k] : i > k/2\}$  for some threshold, i.e., we will set the label  $y = +1$  when more than a half of the relevant patterns are presented in the input.

Example 2. Suppose  $k$  is odd, and let  $P = \{i \in [k] : i \text{ is odd}\}$ , i.e., the labels are given by the parity function on  $\tilde{\phi}_j(j \in A)$ . This is useful to prove our lower bounds via the properties of parities.

Learning Without Input Structure. For comparison, we also consider learning problems without input structure. The data is generated as above but with different distributions  $\mathcal{D}_{\hat{\phi}}$ :

(A1') The patterns are independent, and for any  $i \in [D]$ ,  $\operatorname{Pr}[\tilde{\phi}_i = 1] = 1/2$ .

Given parameters  $\Xi_0 = (d, D, k)$ , the family  $\mathcal{F}_{\Xi_0}$  of distributions without input structure is the set of all the distributions with  $A \subseteq [D]$ ,  $P \subseteq [k]$  and  $\mathcal{D}_{\tilde{\phi}}$  satisfying the above assumptions.

# 3.1 NEURAL NETWORK LEARNING

Networks. We consider training a two-layer network via gradient descent on the data distribution:

$$
g (x) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {2 m} a _ {i} \sigma \left(\left\langle w _ {i}, x \right\rangle + b _ {i}\right) \tag {2}
$$

where  $w_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{d},b_{i},a_{i}\in \mathbb{R}$ , and  $\sigma (z) = \min (1,\max (z,0))$  is the truncated rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. Let  $\theta = \{w_i,b_i,a_i\}_{i = 1}^{2m}$  denote all the parameters, and let superscript  $(t)$  denote the time step, e.g.,  $g^{(t)}$  denote the network at time step  $t$  with  $\theta^{(t)} = \{w_i^{(t)},b_i^{(t)},a_i^{(t)}\}$ .

Loss Function. Similar to typical practice, we will normalize the data for learning: first compute  $x = (\tilde{x} - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{x}]) / \tilde{\sigma}$  where  $\tilde{\sigma}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{d} (\tilde{x}_i - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{x}_i])^2$  is the variance of the data, and then train on  $(x, y)$ . This is equivalent to setting  $\phi = (\tilde{\phi} - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{\phi}]) / \tilde{\sigma}$  and generating  $x = M\phi$ . For  $(\tilde{x}, y)$  from  $\mathcal{D}$  and the normalized  $(x, y)$ , we will simply say  $(x, y) \sim \mathcal{D}$ .

For the training, we consider the hinge-loss  $\ell(y, \hat{y}) = \max\{1 - y\hat{y}, 0\}$ . We will inject some noise  $\xi$  to the neurons for the convenience of the analysis. (This can be viewed as using a smoothed version of the activation  $\tilde{\sigma}(z) = \mathbb{E}_{\xi} \sigma(z + \xi)$  similar to those in existing studies like Allen-Zhu & Li (2020b); Malach et al. (2021). See Section 5 for more explanations.) Formally, the loss is:

$$
L _ {\mathcal {D}} (g; \sigma_ {\xi}) = \mathbb {E} _ {(x, y)} [ \ell (y, g (x; \xi)) ], \text {w h e r e} g (x; \xi) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {2 m} a _ {i} \mathbb {E} _ {\xi} [ \sigma (\langle w _ {i}, x \rangle + b _ {i} + \xi_ {i}) ] \tag {3}
$$

where  $\xi \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\xi}^{2} I_{m \times m})$  are independent Gaussian noise. Let  $L_{\mathcal{D}}(g)$  denote the typical hinge-loss without noise. We also consider  $\ell_2$  regularization:  $R(g; \lambda_a, \lambda_w) = \sum_{i=1}^{2m} \lambda_a |a_i|^2 + \lambda_w \|w_i\|_2^2$  with regularization coefficients  $\lambda_a, \lambda_w$ .

Training Process. We first perform an unbiased initialization: for every  $i \in [m]$ , initialize  $w_i^{(0)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_w^2 I_{d \times d})$  with  $\sigma_w = 1 / k$ ,  $b_i^{(0)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_b^2)$  with  $\sigma_b = 1 / k^2$ ,  $a_i^{(0)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_a^2)$  with  $\sigma_a = \tilde{\sigma}^2 / (\gamma k^2)$ , and then set  $w_{m+i}^{(0)} = w_i^{(0)}$ ,  $b_{m+i}^{(0)} = b_i^{(0)}$ ,  $a_{m+i}^{(0)} = -a_i^{(0)}$ . We then do gradient updates:

$$
\theta^ {(t)} = \theta^ {(t - 1)} - \eta^ {(t)} \nabla_ {\theta} \left(L _ {\mathcal {D}} \left(g ^ {(t - 1)}; \sigma_ {\xi} ^ {(t)}\right) + R \left(g ^ {(t - 1)}; \lambda_ {a} ^ {(t)}, \lambda_ {w} ^ {(t)}\right)\right), \text {f o r} t = 1, 2, \dots , T, \tag {4}
$$

for some choice of the hyperparameters  $\eta^{(t)},\lambda_a^{(t)},\lambda_w^{(t)},\sigma_\xi^{(t)}$  , and  $T$

# 4 MAIN RESULTS

Provable Guarantee for Neural Networks. The network learning has the following guarantee:

Theorem 1. For any  $\delta, \epsilon \in (0,1)$ , if  $p_{o} = \Omega(k^{2}/D)$ ,  $k = \Omega\left(\log^{2}\left(Dm / (\delta \gamma)\right)\right)$ , and  $m \geq \max\{\Omega(k^{12} / \epsilon^{3/2}), D\}$ , then with properly set hyperparameters, we have for any  $\mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{F}_{\Xi}$ , with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ , there exists  $t \in [T]$  such that  $\operatorname*{Pr}[\operatorname{sign}(g^{(t)}(x)) \neq y] \leq L_{\mathcal{D}}(g^{(t)}) \leq \epsilon$ .

The theorem shows that for a wide range of the background pattern probability  $p_{\mathrm{o}}$  and the number of class relevant patterns  $k$ , the network trained by gradient descent can obtain a small 0-1 classification error with high probability. More importantly, the analysis shows the success comes from feature learning. In the early stage, the network learns and improves the neuron weights such that on the corresponding features (i.e., the neurons' outputs) there exists an accurate classifier; afterwards it can learn such an accurate classifier on these features. Next section will provide a detailed discussion on the feature learning and also the choice of the hyperparameters.

Lower Bound for Fixed Features. Empirical observations and Theorem 1 do not exclude the possibility that some learning methods without feature learning can achieve similar performance. We thus prove a lower bound for the fixed feature approach, i.e., linear models on on a set of data-independent features. Such models include random feature approaches (Rahimi & Recht, 2008) and approximate various kernel methods (see the discussion in Kamath et al. (2020)).

Theorem 2. Suppose  $\Psi$  is a data-independent feature mapping of dimension  $N$  with bounded features, i.e.,  $\Psi : \mathcal{X} \to [-1,1]^N$ . For  $B > 0$ , the family of linear models on  $\Psi$  with bounded norm  $B$  is  $\mathcal{H}_B = \{h(\tilde{x}): h(\tilde{x}) = \langle \Psi(\tilde{x}), w \rangle, \|w\|_2 \leq B\}$ . If  $3 < k \leq D/16$  and  $k$  is odd, then there exists  $\mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{F}_{\Xi}$  such that all  $h \in \mathcal{H}_B$  have hinge-loss at least  $p_o\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{2N}B}{2^k}\right)$ .

The theorem shows that using fixed features, one cannot get loss nontrivially smaller than  $p_{\mathrm{o}}$  unless with exponentially large models. In contrast, viewing the hidden neurons as learned features with  $\Psi_{i} = \sigma (\langle w_{i},x\rangle +b_{i})$ , network learning can achieve loss  $\epsilon$  for any  $\epsilon \in (0,1)$  with models of polynomial sizes. This comparison then shows the data-dependent feature learning ability of the networks can help overcome the exponential requirement.

Lower Bound for Without Input Structure. Existing results do not exclude the possibility that some learning methods without exploiting the input structure can achieve strong performance. To show the necessity of the input structure, we consider learning  $\mathcal{F}_{\Xi_0}$  with input structure removed.

We obtain a lower bound for such learning problems in the classic Statistical Query (SQ) model (Kearns, 1998). In this model, the algorithm can only receive information about the data through statistical queries. A statistical query is specified by some polynomially-computable property predicate  $Q$  of labeled instances and a tolerance parameter  $\tau \in [0,1]$ . For a query  $(Q,\tau)$ , the algorithm receives a response  $\hat{P}_Q \in [P_Q - \tau, P_Q + \tau]$ , where  $P_Q = \operatorname*{Pr}[Q(x,y) \text{ is true}]$ . Notice that a query can be simulated using the average of roughly  $O(1 / \tau^2)$  random data samples with high probability. The SQ model captures almost all common learning algorithms (except Gaussian elimination) including the commonly used mini-batch SGD, and thus is suitable for our purpose.

Theorem 3. For any algorithm in the Statistical Query model that can learn over  $\mathcal{F}_{\Xi_0}$  to classification error less than  $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\binom{D}{k}^3}$ , either the number of queries or  $1 / \tau$  must be at least  $\frac{1}{2}\binom{D}{k}^{1/3}$ .

The theorem shows that without the input structure, polynomial algorithms in the SQ model cannot get a classification error nontrivially smaller than random guessing. In contrast, with the input structure, network learning can achieve small classification errors with a polynomial algorithm. This comparison between the two problem settings then shows that the input structure is crucial for network learning, in particular, for achieving the advantage over fixed feature models.

# 5 PROOF SKETCHES

Here we provide the sketch of our analysis, focusing on the key intuition and discussing some interesting implications. The complete proofs are included in Appendix B-D.

# 5.1 PROVABLE GUARANTEES OF NEURAL NETWORKS

Overall Intuition. We first show that there is a two-layer network that can represent the target labeling function, whose neurons can be viewed as the "ground-truth" features to be learned. We then show that after the first gradient step, the hidden neurons of the trained network become close to the ground-truth: their weights contain large components along the class relevant patterns but small along the background patterns. We further show that in the second gradient step, these features get improved: the "signal-noise" ratio between the components for class relevant patterns and those for the background ones becomes larger, giving a set of good features. Finally, we show that the remaining steps learn an accurate classifier on these features.

Existence of A Good Network. We show that there is a two-layer network that can fit the labels.

Lemma 4. For any  $\mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{F}_{\Xi}$ , there exists a network  $g^{*}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{*} \sigma(\langle w_{i}^{*}, x \rangle + b_{i}^{*})$  with  $y = g^{*}(x)$  for any  $(x, y) \sim \mathcal{D}$ . Furthermore, the number of neurons  $n = 3(k+1)$ ,  $|a_{i}^{*}| \leq 32k$ ,  $1/(32k) \leq |b_{i}^{*}| \leq 1/2$ ,  $w_{i}^{*} = \tilde{\sigma} \sum_{j \in A} M_{j} / (4k)$ , and  $|\langle w_{i}^{*}, x \rangle + b_{i}^{*}| \leq 1$  for any  $i \in [n]$  and  $(x, y) \sim \mathcal{D}$ .

In particular, the weights of the neurons are proportional to  $\sum_{j\in A}M_j$ , the sum of the class relevant patterns. We thus focus on analyzing how the network learns such neuron weights.

Feature Emergence in the First Gradient Step. The gradient for  $w_{i}$  (ignoring the noise) is:

$$
\frac {\partial L _ {\mathcal {D}} (g)}{\partial w _ {i}} = - a _ {i} \mathbb {E} _ {(x, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left\{y \mathbb {I} [ y g (x) \leq 1 ] \sigma^ {\prime} [ \langle w _ {i}, x \rangle + b _ {i} ] x \right\} = - a _ {i} \mathbb {E} _ {(x, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left\{y x \sigma^ {\prime} [ \langle w _ {i}, x \rangle + b _ {i} ] \right\}
$$

where the last step is due to  $g(x) = 0$  by the unbiased initialization. Let  $q_{j} = \langle M_{j},w_{i}\rangle$  denote the component along the direction of the pattern  $M_{j}$ . Then the component of the gradient on  $M_{j}$  is:

$$
\langle M _ {j}, \frac {\partial}{\partial w _ {i}} L _ {\mathcal {D}} (g) \rangle = - a _ {i} \mathbb {E} \left\{y \phi_ {j} \sigma^ {\prime} [ \langle w _ {i}, x \rangle + b _ {i} ] \right\} = - a _ {i} \mathbb {E} \left\{y \phi_ {j} \sigma^ {\prime} \left[ \sum_ {\ell \in [ D ]} \phi_ {\ell} q _ {\ell} + b _ {i} \right] \right\}.
$$

The key intuition is that with the randomness of  $\phi_{\ell}$  (and potentially that of the injected noise  $\xi$ ), the random variable under  $\sigma'$  is not significantly affected by a small subset of  $\phi_{\ell}q_{\ell}$ . For example, for class relevant patterns  $j \in A$ , let  $\mathbb{I}_{[D]} := \sigma'\left[\sum_{\ell \in [D]}\phi_{\ell}q_{\ell} + b_i\right]$  and  $\mathbb{I}_{-A} := \sigma'\left[\sum_{\ell \notin A}\phi_{\ell}q_{\ell} + b_i\right]$ . We have  $\mathbb{I}_{[D]} \approx \mathbb{I}_{-A}$  and thus:

$$
\langle M _ {j}, \frac {\partial}{\partial w _ {i}} L _ {\mathcal {D}} (g) \rangle \propto \mathbb {E} \left\{y \phi_ {j} \mathbb {I} _ {[ D ]} \right\} \approx \mathbb {E} \left\{y \phi_ {j} \mathbb {I} _ {- A} \right\} = \mathbb {E} \left\{y \phi_ {j} \right\} \mathbb {E} [ \mathbb {I} _ {- A} ] = \frac {\gamma}{\sigma} \mathbb {E} [ \mathbb {I} _ {- A} ]
$$

since  $y$  only depends on  $\phi_j(j\in A)$ . Then the gradient has a nontrivial component along the pattern. Similarly, for background patterns  $j\notin A$ , the component of the gradient along  $M_{j}$  is close to 0.

Lemma 5 (Informal). Assume  $p_o, k$  as in Theorem 1 and  $\sigma_{\xi}^{(1)} < 1 / k$ , then with high probability  $\frac{\partial}{\partial w_i} L_{\mathcal{D}}(g^{(0)};\sigma_{\xi}^{(1)}) = -a_i^{(0)}\sum_{j = 1}^D M_jT_j$  where for a small  $\epsilon_e$ :

- if  $j \in A$ , then  $|T_j - \beta \gamma / \tilde{\sigma}| \leq O(\epsilon_e / \tilde{\sigma})$  with  $\beta \in [\Omega(1), 1]$ ;  
- if  $j \notin A$ , then  $|T_j| \leq O(\sigma_\phi^2 \epsilon_e \tilde{\sigma})$ .

By setting  $\lambda_w^{(1)} = 1 / (2\eta^{(1)})$ , we have  $w_i^{(1)} = \eta^{(1)}a_i^{(0)}\sum_{j = 1}^D M_jT_j\approx \eta^{(1)}a_i^{(0)}\frac{\beta\gamma}{\bar{\sigma}}\sum_{j\in [D]}M_j$ . For small  $p_0$ , e.g.,  $p_0 = \tilde{O}(k^2 /D)$ , these neurons can already allow accurate prediction. However, for such small  $p_0$ , we cannot show a provable advantage of networks over fixed features. Furthermore, for larger  $p_0$  meaning a significant number of background patterns in the input, the approximation error terms  $T_{j}(j\notin A)$  together can overwhelm the signals  $T_{j}(j\in A)$  and lead to bad prediction, even though each term is small. Fortunately, we will show that the second gradient step can improve the weights by decreasing the ratio between  $T_{j}(j\notin A)$  and  $T_{j}(j\in A)$ .

Feature Improvement in the Second Gradient Step. We note that by setting a small  $\eta^{(1)}$ , after the update we still have  $yg(x;\xi) < 1$  for most  $(x,y)\sim \mathcal{D}$  and thus the gradient in the second step is:

$$
\frac {\partial}{\partial w _ {i}} L _ {\mathcal {D}} (g; \sigma_ {\xi}) \approx - a _ {i} \mathbb {E} _ {(x, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left\{y x \mathbb {E} _ {\xi} \sigma^ {\prime} [ \langle w _ {i}, x \rangle + b _ {i} + \xi_ {i} ] \right\}.
$$

We can then follow the intuition for the first step again. For  $j \in A$ , the component  $\langle M_j, \frac{\partial}{\partial w_i} L_{\mathcal{D}}(g) \rangle$  is roughly proportional to  $\frac{\gamma}{\delta} \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{I}_{-A,\xi}]$  where  $\mathbb{I}_{-A,\xi} \coloneqq \sigma' \left[ \sum_{\ell \not\in A} \phi_\ell q_\ell + b_i + \xi_i \right]$ . While  $\phi_\ell q_\ell$  may not have large enough variance, the injected noise  $\xi_i$  makes sure that a nontrivial amount of data activate the neuron. Then  $\mathbb{I}_{-A,\xi} \neq 0$ , leading to a nontrivial component along  $M_j$ , similar to the first step. On the other hand, for  $j \notin A$ , the approximation error term  $T_j$  depends on how well  $\sigma' \left[ \sum_{\ell \not\in A, \ell \neq j} \phi_\ell q_\ell + b_i + \xi_i \right]$  approximates  $\sigma' \left[ \sum_{\ell \in [D]} \phi_\ell q_\ell + b_i + \xi_i \right]$ . Since the  $q_\ell$ 's (the weight's component along  $M_\ell$ ) in the second step are small compared to those in the first step, we can then get a small error term  $T_j$ .

Lemma 6 (Informal). Assume  $p_o$ ,  $k$  as in Theorem 1,  $\eta^{(1)}$  is sufficiently small, and  $\sigma_{\xi}^{(2)} = 1 / k^{3 / 2}$  then with high probability  $\frac{\partial}{\partial w_i} L_{\mathcal{D}}(g^{(1)};\sigma_{\xi}^{(2)}) = -a_i^{(1)}\sum_{j = 1}^D M_jT_j$  where for a small  $\epsilon_{e2}\ll \epsilon_{e}$ :

- if  $j \in A$ , then  $T_j \approx \beta \gamma / \tilde{\sigma}$  with  $\beta \in [\Omega(1), 1]$ ;  
- if  $j \notin A$ , then  $|T_j| \leq O(\sigma_{\phi}^2 \epsilon_{e2} \tilde{\sigma}) + \frac{1}{\tilde{\sigma}} \exp(-\Theta(p_o D))$ .

So roughly the ratio between  $T_{j}(j \notin A)$  over  $T_{j}(j \in A)$  improves from  $O(\sigma_{\phi}^{2}\tilde{\sigma}^{2}\epsilon_{\mathrm{e}} / \gamma)$  after the first step to  $O(\sigma_{\phi}^{2}\tilde{\sigma}^{2}\epsilon_{\mathrm{e}2} / \gamma)$  after the second step, giving good features allowing accurate prediction.

Remark. The analysis can be carried out for more gradient steps following similar intuition, while we analyze two steps for simplicity.

Remark. Readers may notice that the network can be overparameterized. With sufficient overparameterization and proper initialization and step sizes, network learning becomes approximately NTK. However, here our learning scheme allows going beyond this kernel regime: we use aggressive gradient updates  $\lambda_w^{(t)} = 1 / (2\eta^{(t)})$  in the first two steps, completely forgetting the old weights to learn effective features. Using proper initialization and aggressive updates early to escape the kernel regime has been studied in existing work (e.g., Woodworth et al. (2020); Li et al. (2019)). Our result thus adds another concrete example.

Classifier Learning Stage. Given the learned features, we are then ready to show the remaining gradient steps can learn accurate classifiers. Intuitively, with small hyperparameter values  $(\eta^{(t)} = \frac{k^2}{Tm^{1/3}}, \lambda_a^{(t)} = \lambda_w^{(t)} \leq \frac{k^3}{\hat{\sigma}m^{1/3}}, \sigma_\xi^{(t)} = 0$  for  $2 < t \leq T = m^{4/3}$ ), the first layer's weights do not change too much and thus the learning is similar to convex learning using the learned features. Formally, our proof uses the online convex optimization technique in Daniely & Malach (2020).

# 5.2 LOWER BOUNDS

The lower bounds are based on the following observation: our problem setup is general enough to include learning sparse parity functions. Consider an odd  $k$ , and let  $P = \{i \in [k] : i \text{ is odd}\}$ . Then  $y$  is given by  $\Pi_A(z) := \prod_{j \in A} z_j$  for  $z_j = 2\tilde{\phi}_j - 1$ , i.e., the parity function on  $z_j (j \in A)$ . Then known results for learning parity functions can be applied to prove our lower bounds.

Lower Bound for Fixed Features. We show that  $\mathcal{F}_{\Xi}$  contains learning problems that consist of a mixture of two distributions with weights  $p_0$  and  $1 - p_0$  respectively, where in the first distribution  $\mathcal{D}_A^{(1)}$ ,  $\tilde{x}$  is given by the uniform distribution over  $\tilde{\phi}$  and the label  $y$  is given by the parity function on  $A$ . On such  $\mathcal{D}_A^{(1)}$ , Daniely & Malach (2020) shows that exponentially large models over fixed features is needed to get nontrivial loss. Intuitively, there are exponentially many labeling functions  $\Pi_A$  that are uncorrelated (i.e., "orthogonal" to each other):  $\mathbb{E}[\Pi_{A_1}\Pi_{A_2}] = 0$  for any  $A_1$  and  $A_2$ . Note that the best approximation of  $\Pi_A$  by a fixed set of features  $\Psi_i$ 's is its projection on the linear span of the features. Then with polynomial-size models, there always exists some  $\Pi_A$  far from the linear span.

Remark. It is instructive to compare to network learning, which finds the effective weights  $\sum_{j\in A}M_j$  among the exponentially many candidates corresponding to different  $A$ 's. This can be done efficiently by exploiting the data since the gradient is roughly proportional to  $\mathbb{E}\{yx\} = \sum_{j\in A}M_j$ . The network then learns data-dependent features on which polynomial size linear models can achieve small loss.

Lower Bound for Learning without Input Structure. Clearly,  $\mathcal{F}_{\Xi_0}$  contains the distributions  $\mathcal{D}_A^{(1)}$  described above. The lower bound then follows from classic SQ learning results (Blum et al., 1994).

Remark. The SQ lower bound analysis does not apply to  $\mathcal{F}_{\Xi}$ , because in  $\mathcal{F}_{\Xi}$  the input distribution is related the labeling function. This allows networks to learn with polynomial time/sample. While both the labeling function and the input distribution affect the learning, few existing studies explicitly point out the importance of the input structure. We thus emphasize the input structure is crucial for networks to learn effective features and achieve superior performance.

# 6 EXPERIMENTS

Our experiments mainly focus on feature learning and the effect of the input structure. We first perform simulations on our learning problems to (1) verify our main theorems on the benefit of feature learning and the effect of input structure; (2) verify our analysis of feature learning in networks. We then check if our insights carry over to real data: (3) whether similar feature learning is presented in real network/data; (4) whether damaging the input structure lowers the performance. The results are consistent with our analysis and provide positive support for the theory. Below we present part of the results and include the complete experimental details and results in Appendix E.

Simulation: Verification of the Main Results. We generate data according to our problem setup, with  $d = 500$ ,  $D = 100$ ,  $k = 5$ ,  $p_0 = 1/2$ , a randomly sampled  $A$ , and labels given by the parity function. We then train a two-layer network with  $m = 300$  following our learning process, and for comparison, we also use two fixed feature methods (the NTK and random feature methods based on the same network). Finally, we also use these three methods on the data distribution with the input structure removed (i.e.,  $\mathcal{F}_{\Xi_0}$  in Theorem 3).

Figure 1 shows that the results are consistent with our results. Network learning gets high test accuracy while the two fixed feature methods get significantly lower accuracy. Furthermore, when the input structure is removed, all three methods get test accuracy s

Figure 1: Test accuracy on simulated data with or without input structure.

Simulation: Feature Learning in Networks. We compute the cosine similarities between the weights  $w_{i}$ 's and visualize them by Multidimensional Scaling. (Recall that our analysis is on the directions of the weights without considering their scaling, and thus it is important to choose cosine similarity rather than say the typical Euclidean distance.) Figure 2 shows that the results are as predicted by our analysis. After the first gradient step, some weights begin to cluster around the ground-truth  $\sum_{j\in A}M_j$  (or  $-\sum_{j\in A}M_j$  due to the  $a_{i}$  in the gradient update which can be positive or negative). After the second step, the weights get improved and well-aligned with the ground-truth (with cosine similarities  $>0.99$ ). Furthermore, if a classifier is trained on the features after the first step, the test accuracy is about  $52\%$ ; if the same is done after the second step, the test accuracy is about  $100\%$ . This demonstrates while some effective features emerge in the first step, they need to be improved in the second step to get accurate prediction.

Real Data: Feature Learning in Networks. We perform experiments on MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998; Deng, 2012), CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky, 2012), and SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011). On MNIST, we train a two-layer network with  $m = 50$  on the subset with labels  $0/1$  and visualize the neurons' weights as in the simulation. Figure 3 shows a similar feature learning phenomenon: effective features emerge after a few steps and then get improved to form two clusters. Similar results are observed on other datasets. These suggest the insights obtained in our analysis are also applicable to the real data.

Real Data: The Effect of Input Structure. Since we cannot directly manipulate the input distribution of real data, we perform controlled experiments by injecting different inputs. For labeled dataset  $\mathcal{L}$  and injected input  $\mathcal{U}$ , we first train a teacher network fitting  $\mathcal{L}$ , then use the teacher network to give labels on a mixture of inputs from  $\mathcal{L}$  and  $\mathcal{U}$ , and finally train a student network on this new dataset  $\mathcal{M}$  consisting of the mixed inputs and the teacher network's labels. Checking the student' performance on different parts of  $\mathcal{M}$  and comparing to those by directly training the student on the original data  $\mathcal{L}$  can reveal the impact of chaning the input structure. We use MNIST, CIFAR10, or SVHN as  $\mathcal{L}$ , and use Gaussian or images in Tiny ImageNet (Le & Yang, 2015) as  $\mathcal{U}$ . The networks for MNIST are two-layer with  $m = 9$ , and those for CIFAR10/SVHN are ResNet-18 convolutional neural networks (He et al., 2016).

Figure 4 shows the results on an equal mixture of data and Gaussian. It presents the test accuracy of the student on the original data part, the Gaussian part, and the whole mixture. For example, on CIFAR10, the network learns well over the CIFAR10 part (with accuracy similar to directly training on the original data) but learns slower with worse accuracy on the Gaussian part. Furthermore, the accuracy on the whole mixture is lower than that of training on the original CIFAR10. This shows that the input structure indeed has a significant impact on the learning. While MNIST+Gaussian shows a less significant trend (possibly because the tasks are simpler), the other datasets show similar significant trends as CIFAR10+Gaussian (the results using Tiny ImageNet are in the appendix).

# 7 ETHICS STATEMENT

Our paper is mostly theoretical in nature and thus we foresee no immediate negative ethical impact. We are of the opinion that our theoretical framework may lead to better understanding and inspire development of improved network learning methods, which may have a positive impact in practice. In addition to the theoretical machine learning community, we perceive that our conceptual message that the input structure is crucial for the network learning's performance can be beneficial to engineering-inclined machine learning researchers.
