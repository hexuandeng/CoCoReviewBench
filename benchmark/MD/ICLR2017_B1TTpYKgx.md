# ABSTRACT

We study the expressive power of deep neural networks before and after training. Considering neural nets after random initialization, we show that three natural measures of expressivity all display an exponential dependence on the depth of the network. We prove, theoretically and experimentally, that all of these measures are in fact related to a fourth quantity, trajectory length. This quantity grows exponentially in the depth of the network, and is responsible for the depth sensitivity observed. These results translate to consequences for networks during and after training. They suggest that parameters earlier in a network have greater influence on its expressive power – in particular, given a layer, its influence on expressivity is determined by the remaining depth of the network after that layer. This is verified with experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We also explore the effect of training on the input-output map, and find that it trades off between the stability and expressivity of the input-output map.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Neural network architectures have proven "unreasonably effective" (LeCun, 2014; Karpathy, 2015) on many tasks, including image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), identifying particles in high energy physics (Baldi et al., 2014), playing Go (Silver et al., 2016), and modeling human student learning (Piech et al., 2015). Despite their power, we have limited knowledge of how and why neural networks work, and much of this understanding is qualitative and heuristic.

To aim for a more precise understanding, we must disentangle factors influencing their effectiveness, trainability, or how well they can be fit to data; generalizability, or how well they perform on novel examples; and expressivity, or the set of functions they can compute.

All three of these properties are crucial for understanding the performance of neural networks. Indeed, for success at a particular task, neural nets must first be effectively trained on a dataset, which has prompted investigation into properties of objective function landscapes (Dauphin et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Choromanska et al., 2014), and the design of optimization procedures specifically suited to neural networks (Martens and Grosse, 2015). Trained networks must also be capable of generalizing to unseen data, and understanding generalization in neural networks is also an active line of research: (Hardt et al., 2015) bounds generalization error in terms of stochastic gradient descent steps, (Sontag, 1998; Bartlett and Maass, 2003; Bartlett et al., 1998) study generalization error through VC dimension, and (Hinton et al., 2015) looks at developing smaller models with better generalization.

In this paper, we focus on the third of these properties, expressivity — the capability of neural networks to accurately represent different kinds of functions. As the class of functions achievable by a neural network is dependent on properties of its architecture, e.g. depth, width, fully connected, convolutional, etc; a better understanding of expressivity may greatly inform architectural choice and inspire more tailored training methods.

Prior work on expressivity has yielded many fascinating results by directly examining the achievable functions of a particular architecture. Through this, neural networks have been shown to be

universal approximators (Hornik et al., 1989; Cybenko, 1989), and connections between boolean and threshold networks and ReLU networks developed in (Maass et al., 1994; Pan and Srikumar, 2015). The inherent expressivity due to increased depth has also been studied in (Eldan and Shamir, 2015; Telgarsky, 2015; Martens et al., 2013; Bianchini and Scarselli, 2014), and (Pascanu et al., 2013; Montufar et al., 2014), with the latter introducing the number of linear regions as a measure of expressivity.

These results, while compelling, also highlight limitations of much of the existing work on expressivity. Much of the work examining achievable functions relies on unrealistic architectural assumptions, such as layers being exponentially wide (in the universal approximation theorem). Furthermore, architectures are often compared via 'hardcoded' weight values - a specific function that can be represented efficiently by one architecture is shown to only be inefficiently approximated by another.

Comparing architectures in such a fashion limits the generality of the conclusions, and does not entirely address the goal of understanding expressivity — to provide characteristic properties of a typical set of networks arising from a particular architecture, and extrapolate to practical consequences.

Random networks To address this, we begin our analysis of network expressivity on a family of networks arising in practice — the behaviour of networks after random initialization. As random initialization is the starting point to most training methods, results on random networks provide natural baselines to compare trained networks with, and are also useful in highlighting properties of trained networks (see Section 3). The expressivity of these random networks is largely unexplored. In previous work (Poole et al., 2016) we studied the propagation of Riemannian curvature through random networks by developing a mean field theory approach, which quantitatively supports the conjecture that deep networks can disentangle curved manifolds in input space. Here, we take a more direct approach, exactly relating the architectural properties of the network to measures of expressivity and exploring the consequences for trained networks.

Measures of Expressivity In particular, we examine the effect of the depth and width of a network architecture on three different natural measures of functional richness: number of transitions, activation patterns, and number of dichotomies.

Transitions: Counting neuron transitions is introduced indirectly via linear regions in (Pascanu et al., 2013), and provides a tractable method to estimate the degree of non-linearity of the computed function.

Activation Patterns: Transitions of a single neuron can be extended to the outputs of all neurons in all layers, leading to the (global) definition of a network activation pattern, also a measure of nonlinearity. Network activation patterns directly show how the network partitions input space (into convex polytopes), through connections to the theory of hyperplane arrangements.

Dichotomies: We also measure the heterogeneity of a generic class of functions from a particular architecture by counting dichotomies, 'statistically dual' to sweeping input in some cases. This measure reveals the importance of remaining depth in expressivity, in both simulation and practice.

Connection to Trajectory Length All three measures display an exponential increase with depth, but not width (most strikingly in Figure 4). We discover and prove the underlying reason for this - all three measures are directly proportional to a fourth quantity, trajectory length. In Theorem 1) we show that trajectory length grows exponentially with depth (also supported by experiments, Figure 1) which explains the depth sensitivity of the other three measures.

Consequences for Trained Networks Our empirical and theoretical results connecting transitions and dichotomies to trajectory length also suggest that parameters earlier in the network should have exponentially greater influence on parameters later in the network. In other words, the influence on expressivity of parameters, and thus layers, is directly related to the remaining depth of the network after that layer. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 support this hypothesis — training only earlier layers leads to higher accuracy than training only later layers. We also find, with experiments on MNIST, that the training process trades off between the stability of the input-output map and its expressivity.

# 2 GROWTH OF TRAJECTORY LENGTH AND MEASURES OF EXPRESSIVITY

In this section we examine random networks, proving and empirically verifying the exponential growth of trajectory length with depth. We then relate trajectory length to transitions, activation patterns and dichotomies, and show their exponential increase with depth.

# 2.1 NOTATION AND DEFINITIONS

Let  $F_W$  denote a neural network. In this section, we consider architectures with input dimension  $m$ ,  $n$  hidden layers all of width  $k$ , and (for convenience) a scalar readout layer. (So,  $F_W: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}$ .) Our results mostly examine the cases where  $\phi$  is a hard-tanh (Collobert and Bengio, 2004) or ReLU nonlinearity. All hard-tanh results carry over to tanh with additional technical steps.

We use  $v_{i}^{(d)}$  to denote the  $i^{th}$  neuron in hidden layer  $d$ . We also let  $x = z^{(0)}$  be an input,  $h^{(d)}$  be the hidden representation at layer  $d$ , and  $\phi$  the non-linearity. The weights and bias are called  $W^{(d)}$  and  $b^{(d)}$  respectively. So we have the relations

$$
h ^ {(d)} = W ^ {(d)} z ^ {(d)} + b ^ {(d)}, \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \phi (h ^ {(d)}). \tag {1}
$$

**Definitions** Say a neuron transitions when it switches linear region in its activation function (i.e. for ReLU, switching between zero and linear regimes, for hard-tanh, switching between negative saturation, unsaturated and positive saturation). For hard-tanh, we refer to a sign transition as the neuron switching sign, and a saturation transition as switching from being saturated between  $\pm 1$ . The Activation Pattern of the entire network is defined by the output regions of every neuron. More precisely, given an input  $x$ , we let  $\mathcal{A}(F_W, x)$  be a vector representing the activation region of every hidden neuron in the network. So for a ReLU network  $F_W$ , we can take  $\mathcal{A}(F_W, x) \in \{-1, 1\}^{nk}$  with  $-1$  meaning the neuron is in the zero regime, and  $1$  meaning it is in the linear regime. For

hard-tanh network  $F_{W}$ , we can (overloading notation slightly) take  $\mathcal{A}(F_W,x)\in \{-1,0,1\}^{nk}$ . The use of this notation will be clear by context. Given a set of inputs  $S$ , we say a dichotomy over  $S$  is a labeling of each point in  $S$  as  $\pm 1$ .

We assume the weights of our neural networks are initialized as random Gaussians, with appropriate variance scaling to account for width, i.e.  $W_{ij}^{(d)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_w^2 /k)$ , and biases  $b_{i}^{(d)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_b^2)$ . In the analysis below, we sweep through a one-dimensional input trajectory  $x(t)$ . The results hold for almost any such smooth  $x(t)$ , provided that at any point  $x(t)$ , the trajectory direction has some non-zero magnitude perpendicular to  $x(t)$ .

# 2.2 TRAJECTORY LENGTH AND NEURON TRANSITIONS

We first prove how the trajectory length grows, and relate it to neuron transitions.

# 2.2.1 BOUND ON TRAJECTORY LENGTH GROWTH

We prove (with a more exact lower bound in the Appendix):

Theorem 1. Bound on Growth of Trajectory Length Let  $F_W$  be a hard tanh random neural network and  $x(t)$  a one-dimensional trajectory in input space. Define  $z^{(d)}(x(t)) = z^{(d)}(t)$  to be the image of the trajectory in layer  $d$  of  $F_W$ , and let  $l(z^{(d)}(t)) = \int_t \left| \frac{dz^{(d)}(t)}{dt} \right| dt$  be the arc length of  $z^{(d)}(t)$ . Then

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ l (z ^ {(d)} (t)) \right] \geq O \left(\left(\frac {\sigma_ {w}}{(\sigma_ {w} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}) ^ {1 / 4}} \cdot \frac {\sqrt {k}}{\sqrt {\sqrt {\sigma_ {w} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}} + k}}\right) ^ {d}\right) l (x (t))
$$

This bound is tight in the limits of large  $\sigma_w$  and  $k$ . An immediate Corollary for  $\sigma_b = 0$ , i.e. no bias, is

Corollary 1. Bound on Growth of Trajectory Length Without Bias For  $F_{W}$  with zero bias, we have

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ l (z ^ {(d)} (t)) \right] \geq O \left(\left(\frac {\sqrt {\sigma_ {w} k}}{\sqrt {\sigma_ {w} + k}}\right) ^ {d}\right) l (x (t))
$$

The theorem shows that the image of a trajectory in layer  $d$  has grown exponentially in  $d$ , with the scaling  $\sigma_w$  and width of the network  $k$  determining the base. We additionally state and prove a simple  $O(\sigma_w^d)$  growth upper bound in the Appendix. Figure 1 demonstrates this behavior in simulation, and compares against the bounds. Note also that if the variance of the bias is comparatively too large i.e.  $\sigma_b >> \sigma_w$ , then we no longer see exponential growth. This corresponds to the phase transition described in (Poole et al., 2016).

The proof can be found in the Appendix. A rough outline is as follows: we look at the expected growth of the difference between a point  $z^{(d)}(t)$  on the curve and a small perturbation  $z^{(d)}(t + dt)$ , from layer  $d$  to layer  $d + 1$ . Denoting this quantity  $\left|\left|\delta z^{(d)}(t)\right|\right|$ , we derive a recurrence relating  $\left|\left|\delta z^{(d + 1)}(t)\right|\right|$  and  $\left|\left|\delta z^{(d)}(t)\right|\right|$  which can be composed to give the desired growth rate.

The analysis is complicated by the statistical dependence on the image of the input  $z^{(d + 1)}(t)$ . So we instead form a recursion by looking at the component of the difference perpendicular to the image of the input in that layer, i.e.  $\left|\left|\delta z_{\perp}^{(d + 1)}(t)\right|\right|$ . For a typical trajectory, the perpendicular component preserves a fraction  $\sqrt{\frac{k - 1}{k}}$  of the total trajectory length, and our derived growth rate thus provides a close lower bound, as demonstrated in Figure 1(c,d).

# 2.2.2 RELATION TO NUMBER OF TRANSITIONS

Further experiments (Figure 2) show:

**Observation 1.** The number of sign transitions in a network  $F_{W}$  is directly proportional to the length of the latent image of the curve,  $z^{(n)}(t)$ .

![](images/69d2e990403025d7456351e376e6d96533b1b5ca34ea323e2737c9a8799f0028.jpg)  
Figure 2: The number of transitions is linear in trajectory length. Here we compare the empirical number of sign changes to the length of the trajectory, for images of the same trajectory at different layers of a hard-tanh network. We repeat this comparison for a variety of network architectures, with different network width  $k$  and weight variance  $\sigma_w^2$ .

We intuit a reason for this observation as follows: note that for a network  $F_{W}$  with  $n$  hidden layers, the linear, one dimensional, readout layer outputs a value by computing the inner product  $W^{(n)}z^{(n)}$ . The sign of the output is then determined by whether this quantity is  $\geq 0$  or not. In particular, the decision boundary is a hyperplane, with equation  $W^{(n)}z^{(n)} = 0$ . So, the number of transitions the output neuron makes as  $x(t)$  is traced is exactly the number of times  $z^{(n)}(t)$  crosses the decision boundary. As  $F_{W}$  is a random neural network, with signs of weight entries split purely randomly between  $\pm 1$ , it would suggest that points far enough away from each other would have independent signs, i.e. a direct proportionality between the length of  $z^{(n)}(t)$  and the number of times it crosses the decision boundary.

We can also prove this in the special case when  $\sigma_w$  is very large. Note that by Theorem 1, very large  $\sigma_w$  results in a trajectory growth rate of

$$
g (k, \sigma_ {w}, \sigma_ {b}, n) = O \left(\left(\frac {\sqrt {k}}{\sqrt {1 + \frac {\sigma_ {b} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {w} ^ {2}}}}\right) ^ {n}\right)
$$

Large  $\sigma_w$  also means that for any input (bounded away from zero), almost all neurons are saturated. Furthermore, any neuron transitioning from 1 to  $-1$  (or vice versa) does so almost instantaneously. In particular, at most one neuron within a layer is transitioning for any input. We can then show that in the large  $\sigma_w$  limit the number of transitions matches the trajectory length (proof in the Appendix, via a reduction to magnitudes of independent Gaussians):

Theorem 2. Number of transitions in large weight limit  $\text{Given } F_W$ , in the very large  $\sigma_w$  regime, the number of sign transitions of the network as an input  $x(t)$  is swept is of the order of  $g(k, \sigma_w, \sigma_b, n)$ .

# 2.3 TRANSITIONS AND ACTIVATION PATTERNS

We can generalize the 'local' notion of expressivity of a neuron's sign transitions to a 'global' measure of activation patterns over the entire network. We can formally relate network activation patterns to specific hyperplane arrangements, which allows proof of three exciting results.

First, we can precisely state the effect of a neural network on input space, also visualized in Figure 3

Theorem 3. Regions in Input Space Given a network  $F_{W}$  with with ReLU or hard-tanh activations, input space is partitioned into convex regions (polytopes), with  $F_{W}$  corresponding to a different linear function on each region.

This results in a bijection between transitions and activation patterns for 'well-behaved' trajectories, see the proof of Theorem 3 and Corollary 2 in Appendix.

Finally, returning to the goal of understanding expressivity, we can upper bound the expressive power of a particular architecture according to the activation patterns measure:

![](images/eb372c83bb11b5f5003cc3997a99a51385a823dea14be82e8126b6c79ede7b1c.jpg)  
Figure 3: Deep networks with piecewise linear activations subdivide input space into convex polytopes. Here we plot the boundaries in input space separating unit activation and inactivation for all units in a three layer ReLU network, with four units in each layer. The left pane shows activation boundaries (corresponding to a hyperplane arrangement) in gray for the first layer only, partitioning the plane into regions. The center pane shows activation boundaries for the first two layers. Inside every first layer region, the second layer activation boundaries form a different hyperplane arrangement. The right pane shows activation boundaries for the first three layers, with different hyperplane arrangements inside all first and second layer regions. This final set of convex regions correspond to different activation patterns of the network – i.e. different linear functions.

Figure 4: The number of functions achievable in a deep hard-tanh network by sweeping a single layer's weights along a one-dimensional trajectory is exponential in the remaining depth, but increases only slowly with network width. Here we plot the number of classification dichotomies over  $s = 15$  input vectors achieved by sweeping the first layer weights in a hard-tanh network along a one-dimensional great circle trajectory. We show this ( $a$ ) as a function of remaining depth for several widths, and ( $b$ ) as a function of width for several remaining depths. All networks were generated with weight variance  $\sigma_w^2 = 8$ , and bias variance  $\sigma_b^2 = 0$ .

Theorem 4. (Tight) Upper bound for Number of Activation Patterns Given a neural network  $F_W$ , inputs in  $\mathbb{R}^m$ , with ReLU or hard-tanh activations, and with  $n$  hidden layers of width  $k$ , the number of activation patterns grows at most like  $O(k^{mn})$  for ReLU, or  $O((2k)^{mn})$  for hard-tanh.

# 2.4 DICHOTOMIES: A NATURAL DUAL

So far, we have looked at the effects of depth and width on the expressiveness (measured through transitions and activations) of a generic function computed by that network architecture. These measures are directly related to trajectory length, which is the underlying reason for exponential depth dependence.

A natural extension is to study a class of functions that might arise from a particular architecture. One such class of functions is formed by sweeping the weights of a network instead of the input. More formally, we pick random matrices,  $W$ ,  $W'$ , and consider the weight interpolation  $W\cos(t) + W'\sin(t)$ , each choice of weights giving a different function. When this process is applied to just the first layer, we have a statistical duality with sweeping a circular input.

![](images/e34cd8552266a74e1dfd4fb37da53b39ffdb67d4b51985a342ec885203c8666d.jpg)  
Figure 5: Expressive power depends only on remaining network depth. Here we plot the number of dichotomies achieved by sweeping the weights in different network layers through a 1-dimensional great circle trajectory, as a function of the remaining network depth. The number of achievable dichotomies does not depend on the total network depth, only on the number of layers above the layer swept. All networks had width  $k = 128$ , weight variance  $\sigma_w^2 = 8$ , number of datapoints  $s = 15$ , and hard-tanh nonlinearities. The blue dashed line indicates all  $2^s$  possible dichotomies for this random dataset.

![](images/74900dd2f047755878ade6861fb240819165e22060cf3cd74a236ef3d6ccb64c.jpg)  
Figure 6: Demonstration of expressive power of remaining depth on MNIST. Here we plot train and test accuracy achieved by training exactly one layer of a fully connected neural net on MNIST. The different lines are generated by varying the hidden layer chosen to train. All other layers are kept frozen after random initialization. We see that training lower hidden layers leads to better performance. The networks had width  $k = 100$ , weight variance  $\sigma_w^2 = 2$ , and hard-tanh nonlinearities. Note that we only train from the second hidden layer (weights  $W^{(1)}$ ) onwards, so that the number of parameters trained remains fixed. While the theory addresses training accuracy and not generalization accuracy, the same monotonic pattern is seen for both.

Given this class of functions, one useful measure of expressivity is determining how heterogeneous this class is. Inspired by classification tasks we formalize it as: given a set of inputs,  $S = \{x_{1},\dots,x_{s}\} \subset \mathbb{R}^{m}$ , how many of the  $2^{s}$  possible dichotomies does this function class produce on  $S$ ?

For non-random inputs and non-random functions, this is a well known question upper bounded by the Sauer-Shelah lemma (Sauer, 1972). We discuss this further in Appendix D.1. In the random setting, the statistical duality of weight sweeping and input sweeping suggests a direct proportion to transitions and trajectory length for a fixed input. Furthermore, if the  $x_{i} \in S$  are sufficiently uncorrelated (e.g. random) class label transitions should occur independently for each  $x_{i}$ . Indeed, we show this in Figure 4 (more figures, e.g. dichotomies vs transitions and observations, are included in the Appendix).

Observation 2. Depth and Expressivity in a Function Class. Given the function class  $\mathcal{F}$  as above, the number of dichotomies expressible by  $\mathcal{F}$  over a set of random inputs  $S$  by sweeping the first layer weights along a one-dimensional trajectory  $W^{(0)}(t)$  is exponential in the network depth  $n$ .

![](images/f1aef0a488a0071e744a42c2328d9fdd52188e4528a70c3ffbf3b660fb0821b3.jpg)  
Figure 7: We repeat a similar experiment in Figure 6 with a fully connected network on CIFAR-10, and mostly observe that training lower layers again leads to better performance. The networks had width  $k = 200$ , weight variance  $\sigma_w^2 = 1$ , and hard-tanh nonlinearities. We again only train from the second hidden layer on so that the number of parameters remains fixed.

# 3 TRAINED NETWORKS

Remaining Depth The results from Section 2, particularly those linking dichotomies to trajectory length, suggest that earlier layers in the network might have more expressive power. In particular, the remaining depth of the network beyond the layer might directly influence its expressive power. We see that this holds in the random network case (Figure 5), and also for networks trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10. In Figures 6, 7 we randomly initialized a neural network, and froze all the layers except for one, which we trained.

Training trades off between input-output map stability and expressivity We also look at the effect of training on measures of expressivity by plotting the change in trajectory length and number of transitions (see Appendix) during the training process. We find that for a network initialized with large  $\sigma_w$ , the training process appears to stabilize the input-output map – monotonically decreasing trajectory length (Figure 8) except for the final few steps. Interestingly, this happens at a faster rate in the vicinity of the data than for random inputs, and is accomplished without reducing weight magnitudes.

For a network closer to the boundary of the exponential regime  $\sigma_w^2 = 3$ , where trajectory length growth is still exponential but with a much smaller base, the training process increases the trajectory length, enabling greater expressivity in the resulting input-output map, Figure 9

![](images/174160d2e0854a6c12558e89e481971e734777ac44684b405c8780c0570fb7b3.jpg)

The left pane plots the growth of trajectory length as a circular interpolation between two MNIST datapoints is propagated through the network, at different train steps. Red indicates the start of training, with purple the end of training. Interestingly, and supporting the observation on remaining depth, the first layer appears to increase trajectory length, in contrast with all later layers, suggesting it is being primarily used to fit the data. The right pane shows an identical plot but for an interpolation between random points, which also display decreasing trajectory length, but at a slower rate. Note the output layer is not plotted, due to artificial scaling of length through normalization. The network is initialized with  $\sigma_w^2 = 16$ . A similar plot is observed for the number of transitions (see Appendix.)

Figure 9: Training increases expressivity of input-output map for  $\sigma_w$  small. The left pane plots the growth of trajectory length as a circular interpolation between two MNIST datapoints is propagated through the network, at different train steps. Red indicates the start of training, with purple the end of training. We see that the training process increases trajectory length, likely to increase the expressivity of the input-output map to enable greater accuracy. The right pane shows an identical plot but for an interpolation between random points, which also displays increasing trajectory length, but at a slower rate. Note the output layer is not plotted, due to artificial scaling of length through normalization. The network is initialized with  $\sigma_w^2 = 3$ .

# 4 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we studied the expressivity of neural networks through three measures, neuron transitions, activation patterns and dichotomies, and explained the observed exponential dependence on depth of all three measures by demonstrating the underlying link to latent trajectory length. Having explored these results in the context of random networks, we then looked at the consequences for trained networks (see Table 1). We find that the remaining depth above a network layer influences its expressive power, which might inspire new pre-training or initialization schemes. Furthermore, we see that training interpolates between expressive power and better generalization. This relation between initial and final parameters might inform early stopping and warm starting rules.
