# ABSTRACT

It is challenging to design reward functions for complex, real-world tasks. Reward learning algorithms let one instead infer a reward function from data. However, multiple reward functions often explain the data equally well, even in the limit of infinite data. Prior work has focused on situations where the reward function is uniquely recoverable, by introducing additional assumptions or data sources. By contrast, we formally characterise the partial identifiability of popular data sources such as demonstrations and trajectory preferences. We analyse the impact of this ambiguity on downstream tasks such as policy optimisation, including under shifts in environment dynamics. These results have implications for the evaluation of algorithms and selection of data sources for reward learning.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A wide range of problems can be represented as sequential decision-making tasks, where the goal is to maximize some numerical reward (Sutton & Barto, 2018). However, designing an appropriate reward function remains a challenge in complex real-world tasks (Amodei et al., 2016; Leike et al., 2018; Dulac-Arnold et al., 2019). Reward learning algorithms infer task reward functions from data sources such as expert demonstrations (Ng & Russell, 2000), preferences over trajectories (Christiano et al., 2017), and many others (Jeon et al., 2020). This approach has extended the applicability of sequential decision-making techniques to more complex tasks (e.g. Abbeel et al., 2010; Christiano et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2019; Stiannon et al., 2020).

Multiple reward functions are often consistent with the data source, even in the infinite-data limit. For most data sources, this fundamental ambiguity has been acknowledged, but its extent has not been characterised. In section 3, we formally characterise the ambiguity of several popular data sources including expert demonstrations and trajectory preferences. These infinite-data limits bound the information recoverable from finite data sets using any algorithm, so they are useful for evaluating algorithms and data sources.

Learnt reward functions are often used for policy optimisation and evaluation, for example via reinforcement learning  $(\mathrm{RL})^{1}$ . The kinds of reward ambiguity that matter depend on the intended application: uniquely identifying a reward function is unnecessary when all plausible reward functions lead to the same downstream outcome. In section 3 we formally characterise the ambiguity tolerance of policy optimisation under arbitrary dynamics. These characterisations allow us to evaluate the ambiguity of a data source relative to a given application.

Ambiguity and ambiguity tolerance are formally related. Both concern invariances – of data sources or downstream outcomes – to reward function transformations. Thus, our main contribution is to catalogue the invariances of various mathematical objects derived from the reward function. In section 4, we explore a partial order on these invariances, and its implications for the selection and evaluation of data sources, addressing a current open problem in reward learning (Leike et al., 2018, §3.1). We discuss other limitations and possible extensions in section 5.

Figure 1: (a) The infinite-data ambiguity of reward learning data sources, and the ambiguity tolerance of downstream applications of a learnt reward function, are both invariances of objects derived from reward functions (sections 1.2 and 3). These invariances have a partial order (section 4):  $X \rightarrow Y$  means that  $Y$  can be derived from  $X$ , or equivalently that  $Y$  is at least as ambiguous as  $X$ . The objects are: the reward function itself ( $R$ );  $Q$ -functions ( $Q$ ); Maximum Entropy ( $\beta$ ) and supportive optimal policies ( $\star$ ) and their induced trajectory distributions ( $\pi_{\beta}, \Delta_{\beta}$  and  $\pi_{\star}, \Delta_{\star}$ ); the return function restricted to partial and full trajectories ( $G_{\zeta}, G_{\xi}$ ); Boltzmann-distributed ( $\beta$ ) and noiseless ( $\star$ ) comparisons between these trajectories ( $\preceq_{\beta}, \preceq_{\beta}^{\xi}$  and  $\preceq_{\star}, \preceq_{\star}^{\xi}$ ). (b) Several basic families of reward transformations form the basis for our main results (section 2). These transformations exist in a related hierarchy, within (shown here) and across tasks (section 4).

# 1.1 RELATED WORK

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL; Russell, 1998) is the prototypical example of reward learning. IRL infers a reward function from the behavioural data of a task expert by inverting a model of the expert's planning algorithm (Armstrong & Mindermann, 2017; Shah et al., 2019). Existing work partially characterises the inherent ambiguity of behaviour for certain planning algorithms (Ng & Russell, 2000; Cao et al., 2021) and classes of tasks (Dvijotham & Todorov, 2010; Kim et al., 2021). We extend these results to more planning algorithms and arbitrary time-unbounded, stochastic tasks, using a more expressive space of reward functions that reveals novel ambiguity.

Reward learning models have been proposed for many other data sources (Jeon et al., 2020). A popular and effective data source is preferences over behavioural trajectories (Akrour et al., 2012; Christiano et al., 2017). Unlike for IRL, the ambiguity arising from these data sources has not been formally characterised. We contribute a formal characterisation of the ambiguity for central models of evaluative feedback including trajectory preferences.

Several studies have explored learning from expert behaviour and preferences (Ibarz et al., 2018; Palan et al., 2019; Biyik et al., 2020; Koppol et al., 2020), or other multi-modal data sources (Tung et al., 2018; Jeon et al., 2020). One motivation is that different data sources may provide complementary reward information (Koppol et al., 2020), eliminating some ambiguity. Similarly, Amin et al. (2017) and Cao et al. (2021) observe reduced ambiguity by combining behavioural data across multiple tasks. Our partial order provides a general framework for understanding these results.

Computing an optimal behavioural policy is a primary application of learnt reward functions (Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Wirth et al., 2017). Ng et al. (1999) proved that potential shaping transformations always preserve the set of optimal policies, and so are always tolerable for this application. We extend this result, characterising the full set of transformations that preserve optimal policies in each task, including for additional policy optimisation techniques such as maximum entropy RL.

Ambiguity corresponds to the partial identifiability (Lewbel, 2019) of the reward function modelled as a latent parameter. The prevailing response to partial identifiability in reward learning has been to impose additional constraints or assumptions until the data identifies the reward function uniquely (or, at least, sufficiently for policy optimisation). Following Manski (1995; 2003) and Tamer (2010), we instead describe ambiguity given various constraints and assumptions. This gives practitioners results appropriate for their real data (and the ambiguity tolerance of their actual application).

IRL is related to dynamic discrete choice (Rust, 1994; Aguirregabiria & Mira, 2010), a problem where identifiability has been extensively studied (e.g., Aguirregabiria, 2005; Srisuma, 2015; Arcidiacono & Miller, 2020). We study a simpler setting with known tasks. IRL also relates to preference elicitation (Rothkopf & Dimitrakakis, 2011) and inverse optimal control (Ab Azar et al., 2020). Preferences over sequential trajectories are not typically considered as a data source in other fields.

# 1.2 PRELIMINARIES

We consider an idealised setting with finite, observable, infinite-horizon sequential decision-making environments, formalised as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs; Sutton & Barto, 2018, §3). An MDP is a tuple  $(S, \mathcal{A}, \tau, \mu_0, R, \gamma)$  where  $S$  and  $\mathcal{A}$  are finite sets of environment states and agent actions;  $\tau: S \times \mathcal{A} \to \Delta(S)$  encodes the transition distributions governing the environment dynamics;  $\mu_0 \in \Delta(S)$  is an initial state distribution;  $R: S \times \mathcal{A} \times S \to \mathbb{R}$  is a deterministic reward function $^2$ ; and  $\gamma \in (0, 1)$  is a reward discount rate. We distinguish states in the support of  $\mu_0$  as initial states, and states  $s$  with  $\tau(s|s, a) = 1$  and  $R(s, a, s) = 0$  for all  $a$  as terminal states.

We represent the transition from state  $s$  to state  $s'$  using action  $a$  as the tuple  $x = (s, a, s')$ . We classify  $(s, a, s')$  as possible in an MDP if  $s'$  is in the support of  $\tau(s, a)$ , otherwise it is impossible. A trajectory is an infinite sequence of concatenate transitions  $\xi = (s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, s_2, \ldots)$ , and a trajectory fragment of length  $n$  is a finite sequence of  $n$  concatenate transitions  $\zeta = (s_0, a_0, s_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, s_n)$ . A trajectory or fragment is possible if all of its transitions are possible, and is impossible otherwise. A trajectory or fragment is initial if its first state is initial. A state or transition is reachable if it is part of some possible and initial trajectory.

Given an MDP, we define the return function  $G$  as the cumulative discounted reward of entire trajectories and trajectory fragments:  $G(\zeta) = \sum_{t=0}^{n-1} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$  for a trajectory fragment  $\zeta$  of length  $n$ , and similarly for trajectories. We primarily consider this return function with various restricted domains, such as only possible or initial trajectories or trajectory fragments.

A policy  $\pi : S \to \Delta(\mathcal{A})$  encodes an agent's behaviour as a state-conditional action distribution. Together with an MDP's transition distribution  $\tau$ , a policy  $\pi$  induces a distribution of trajectories starting from each state. We denote such a trajectory starting from  $s$  with the random variable  $\Xi_s$ , and its remaining components with random variables  $A_0, S_1, A_1, S_2$ , and so on.

Given an MDP and a policy  $\pi$ , and the value function encodes the expected return from states,  $V_{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\Xi_s \sim \pi, \tau} [G(\Xi_s)]$ ; and the  $Q$ -function of  $\pi$  encodes the expected return given an initial action,  $Q_{\pi}(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{\Xi_s \sim \pi, \tau} [G(\Xi_s) | A_0 = a]$ .  $Q_{\pi}$  and  $V_{\pi}$  satisfy a Bellman equation:

$$
Q _ {\pi} (s, a) = \mathbb {E} _ {S ^ {\prime} \sim \tau (s, a)} \left[ R (s, a, S ^ {\prime}) + \gamma V _ {\pi} \left(S ^ {\prime}\right) \right], \quad V _ {\pi} (s) = \mathbb {E} _ {A \sim \pi (s)} \left[ Q _ {\pi} (s, A) \right], \tag {1}
$$

for all  $s \in S$  and  $a \in \mathcal{A}$ . Their difference,  $A_{\pi}(s,a) = Q_{\pi}(s,a) - V_{\pi}(s)$ , is the advantage function.

We further define a policy evaluation function,  $\mathcal{I}$ , encoding the expected return from following a particular policy in an MDP,  $\mathcal{J}(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{S_0\sim \mu_0}\big[V_\pi (S_0)\big]$ .  $\mathcal{J}$  induces an order over policies. A policy maximising  $\mathcal{J}$  is an optimal policy, denoted  $\pi_{\star}$ . Similarly,  $Q_{\star},V_{\star}$ , and  $A_{\star}$  denote the  $Q-$ , value, and advantage functions of an optimal policy. Since  $\mathcal{J}$  may be multimodal, we often discuss the set of optimal policies. However,  $Q_{\star},V_{\star}$ , and  $A_{\star}$  are unique.

Moreover, we consider several policies resulting from alternative planning algorithms. Given a base policy  $\pi_0$ , and an inverse temperature parameter  $\beta > 0$ , we define the Boltzmann policy with respect to  $\pi_0$ , denoted  $\pi_{\beta}^{\pi_0}$ , using the softmax function:

$$
\pi_ {\beta} ^ {\pi_ {0}} (a | s) = \frac {\exp (\beta A _ {\pi_ {0}} (s , a))}{\sum_ {a ^ {\prime} \in , A} \exp (\beta A _ {\pi_ {0}} (s , a ^ {\prime}))}. \tag {2}
$$

The Boltzmann-rational policy,  $\pi_{\beta}^{\star}$ , is the Boltzmann policy with respect to optimal policies, as used for IRL by Ramachandran & Amir (2007). The popular Maximum Entropy policy,  $\pi_{\beta}$ , is the solution to the recurrence  $\pi_{\beta} = \pi_{\beta}^{\pi_{\beta}}$  (Haarnoja et al., 2017).

# 2 REWARD FUNCTION TRANSFORMATIONS

In this section, we discuss how invariance to reward function transformations relates to infinite-data ambiguity in reward learning and ambiguity tolerance in applications.

Definition 2.1 (Transformations and invariances). A transformation is a map between reward functions. The invariances of an object  $X$  derived from reward  $R$  via function  $f$  are all transformations  $t$  that preserve  $f$ :  $f(R) = f(t(R))$  for all  $R$ . We say that  $X$  determines  $R$  up to its invariances.

A set of transformations carves out a partition of the space of reward functions by grouping together those reward functions reachable from one another using the transformations. The partition carved out by the invariances of an object is the equivalence kernel of the object's derivation function - grouping the reward functions from which identical objects are derived into partition blocks.

Given a reward learning data source, consider the object encoding the information available from the data source in the infinite-data limit (Lewbel, 2019, §3.1). The invariances of this object represent the infinite-data ambiguity of the data source – it is impossible to recover the reward function beyond the corresponding partition block, as the remaining functions imply indistinguishable data.

Similarly, consider a downstream application of learnt reward functions involving the computation of some object. The object's invariances capture the ambiguity tolerance of this computation, as by definition all reward functions in each cell of the corresponding partition lead to identical outcomes.

# 2.1 FUNDAMENTAL REWARD TRANSFORMATIONS

We introduce several fundamental sets of transformations of reward functions, forming the basis for the invariances we study in section 3. First, we recall potential shaping, introduced by Ng et al. (1999) and widely known to preserve optimal policies in all MDPs. We further distinguish a special class of potential shaping transformations with constant potential over a given MDP's initial states.

Definition 2.2 (Potential Shaping). A potential function is a function  $\Phi : S \to \mathbb{R}$ , where  $\Phi(s) = 0$  if  $s$  is a terminal state. If  $\Phi(s) = k$  for all initial states then we say that  $\Phi$  is  $k$ -initial. Let  $R$  and  $R'$  be reward functions. Given a discount  $\gamma$ , we say  $R'$  is produced by ( $k$ -initial) potential shaping of  $R$  if  $R'(s, a, s') = R(s, a, s') + \gamma \cdot \Phi(s') - \Phi(s)$  for some ( $k$ -initial) potential function  $\Phi$ .

We explore some properties of potential shaping in appendix A. We also consider several more novel transformations, below.

Definition 2.3 ( $S'$ -Redistribution). Let  $R$  and  $R'$  be reward functions. Given transition dynamics  $\tau$ , say  $R'$  is produced by  $S'$ -redistribution of  $R$  if  $\mathbb{E}_{S' \sim \tau(s, a)}[R(s, a, S')] = \mathbb{E}_{S' \sim \tau(s, a)}[R'(s, a, S')]$ .

$S^{\prime}$ -redistribution allows changing  $R$  arbitrarily for impossible transitions. Moreover, if at least two states  $s_1^\prime$ ,  $s_2^\prime$  are in the support of  $\tau (s,a)$  then  $S^{\prime}$ -redistribution lets us increase  $R(s,a,s_1^{\prime})$  and decrease  $R(s,a,s_2^{\prime})$  by a proportionate amount. Note that  $S^{\prime}$ -redistribution depends crucially on the reward function's dependence on the successor state. This set of transformations collapses to the identity for simpler spaces of reward functions, as we explore in appendix C.

Definition 2.4 (Monotonic Transformations). Let  $R$  and  $R'$  be reward functions. Say  $R'$  is produced by a zero-preserving monotonic transformation of  $R$  if for all pairs of transitions  $x, x' \in S \times A \times S$ ,  $R(x) \leqslant R(x')$  if and only if  $R'(x) \leqslant R'(x')$ , and  $R(x) = 0$  if and only if  $R'(x) = 0$ . Moreover, say  $R'$  is produced by positive linear scaling of  $R$  if  $R' = c \cdot R$  for some positive constant  $c$ .

A zero-preserving monotonic transformation is simply a monotonic transformation that maps zero to itself. Positive linear scaling is a special case.

Definition 2.5 (Optimality-Preserving Transformation). Let  $R$  and  $R'$  be reward functions. Given a function  $\mathcal{O}: S \to \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A}) - \{\varnothing\}$ , transition dynamics  $\tau$ , and discount rate  $\gamma$ , we say  $R'$  is produced from  $R$  by an optimality-preserving transformation with  $\mathcal{O}$  if there is a function  $\Psi: S \to \mathbb{R}$  such that  $\mathbb{E}_{S' \sim \tau(s, a)}[R'(s, a, S') + \gamma \cdot \Psi(S')] \leqslant \Psi(s)$  for all  $s, a$ , with equality if and only if  $a \in \mathcal{O}(s)$ .

This transformation gives the reward functions with optimal actions from  $\mathcal{O}$  ( $\Psi$  determines the new value function). We can change  $R$  arbitrarily if  $\mathcal{O}$  is unconstrained (in practice, we constrain  $\mathcal{O}$ ).

Finally, we consider transformations allowing the reward to vary freely for a given set of transitions.

Definition 2.6 (Masking). Let  $R$  and  $R'$  be reward functions. Given a transition set  $\mathcal{X} \subseteq S \times \mathcal{A} \times S$ , say  $R'$  is produced by a mask of  $\mathcal{X}$  from  $R$  if  $R(x) = R'(x)$  for all  $x \notin \mathcal{X}$ .

# 3 INVARIANCES OF REWARD-RELATED OBJECTS

In this section we catalogue the invariances of various central objects derived from reward functions, including expert trajectory distributions, the ranking of trajectories induced by the return function, and the set of optimal policies. Some of these objects correspond to the information available in the infinite-data limit of a reward learning data source, while others correspond to the outcome of a downstream application.

If an object  $X$  can be derived from another object  $Y$  without further reference to the reward function, then  $X$  inherits  $Y$ 's invariances. For example, the optimal  $Q$ -function's invariances are inherited by various expert policies. Accordingly, we organise this section by incrementally deriving our objects of interest starting from the reward function, cataloguing the invariances introduced in each step. We defer all proofs until appendix B.

# 3.1 INVARIANCES OF EXPERT BEHAVIOUR

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms infer a task's reward function from the behaviour of task experts. Formally, this behaviour is represented as an expert's policy or a sample of trajectories.

To characterise the corresponding invariances, we begin with  $Q$ -functions – instrumental to deriving many policies.  $Q$ -functions are invariant to  $S'$ -redistribution since they are defined as an expectation over the successor state  $S'$ . We show that this is the only invariance for  $Q$ -functions.

Theorem 3.1. Given an MDP and a policy  $\pi$ , the  $Q$ -function for  $\pi$ ,  $Q_{\pi}$ , determines  $R$  up to  $S'$ -redistribution. The optimal  $Q$ -function,  $Q_{\star}$ , has precisely the same invariances.

This invariance is inherited by any object that can be derived from a  $Q$ -function. However, note that  $S'$ -redistribution vanishes in simpler spaces of reward functions, as we explore in appendix C.

We now turn to policies derived from the reward function using various planning algorithms. These policies are instrumental in constructing the trajectories studied in IRL. For example, Ramachandran & Amir (2007) and Ziebart et al. (2008) assume that expert behaviour is drawn from a Boltzmann-rational policy, and Ziebart et al. (2010) assume a Maximum Entropy policy. We catalogue the invariances of arbitrary Boltzmann policies, of which these other policies are special cases. As these policies can be derived from  $Q$ -functions, they inherit invariance to  $S'$ -redistribution. We show they are also invariant to potential shaping, but not to any other transformations.

Theorem 3.2. Given an MDP, an inverse temperature parameter  $\beta$ , and a base policy  $\pi_0$ , the Boltzmann policy  $\pi_{\beta}^{\pi_0}$  determines  $R$  up to  $S'$ -redistribution and potential shaping. The Boltzmannrational policy,  $\pi_{\beta}^{\star}$ , and the Maximum Entropy policy,  $\pi_{\beta}$ , have precisely the same invariances.

By contrast, Ng & Russell (2000) and Abbeel & Ng (2004) assume that experts follow an optimal policy. Optimal policies inherit  $S'$ -redistribution invariance from the optimal  $Q$ -function, and are also known to be invariant to potential shaping (Ng et al., 1999). Under an additional assumption that a given policy is maximally supportive, in that it takes all optimal actions with positive probability, we show that any additional invariances are captured in a class of optimality-preserving transformations (Definition 2.5) based on the set of optimal actions in each state.

Theorem 3.3. Given an MDP, let  $\mathcal{O}(s) = \arg \max_{a} A_{\star}(s, a)$ . A maximally supportive optimal policy determines  $R$  up to optimality-preserving transformations with  $\mathcal{O}$ .

Additional invariances arise if we consider optimal policies that may lack support for optimal actions. As a well-known example, the zero-reward is consistent with any policy in this sense.

In the infinite-data limit, a data source of trajectories sampled from a policy reveals the distribution of trajectories induced by the policy, and therefore the policy itself for all states reachable via its supported actions. A Boltzmann policy supports all actions, so in the infinite data limit, samples of trajectories determine the policy for all reachable states. We show this introduces invariance precisely to changes in the reward of unreachable transitions.

Theorem 3.4. Given an MDP, an inverse temperature parameter  $\beta$ , and a base policy  $\pi_0$ , the distribution of trajectories induced by the Boltzmann policy  $\pi_{\beta}^{\pi_0}$  from all initial states determines  $R$  up to  $S'$ -redistribution, potential shaping, and a mask of unreachable transitions. The distributions of trajectories induced by the Boltzmann-rational policy,  $\pi_{\beta}^{\star}$ , and the Maximum Entropy policy,  $\pi_{\beta}$ , from all initial states, have precisely the same invariances.

Similarly, trajectories sampled from an optimal policy reveal the policy in those states that its actions reach. This again introduces additional invariance to transformations of reward in other states.

Theorem 3.5. Given an MDP, consider the distribution of trajectories induced by a maximally supportive optimal policy. Let  $\mathfrak{S}$  be the set of states in supported trajectories. Let  $\mathfrak{D}$  be the set of functions  $\mathcal{O}$  defined on  $S$  such that  $\mathcal{O}(s) = \arg \max_{a} A_{\star}(s, a)$  for all  $s \in \mathfrak{S}$ . The induced distribution of trajectories determines  $R$  up to optimality-preserving transformations with  $\mathcal{O} \in \mathfrak{D}$ .

Note that a mask of the complement of  $\mathfrak{S}$  is not permitted. However, the fact that  $\mathcal{O}$  is unconstrained outside  $\mathfrak{S}$  leaves reward effectively unconstrained in those states, except that the reward of transitions out of  $\mathfrak{S}$  may have to "compensate" for the value of their successor states, to prevent new actions that lead out of  $\mathfrak{S}$  from becoming optimal.

# 3.2 INVARIANCES OF TRAJECTORY EVALUATION

The return function, capturing the reward accumulated over a trajectory, is instrumental in deriving data for evaluative feedback such as reward labels and trajectory preference comparisons. We consider the invariances of the return function for various restricted domains.

Theorem 3.6. Given an MDP, the return function restricted to possible trajectory fragments,  $G_{\zeta}$ , determines  $R$  up to a mask of impossible transitions;

Theorem 3.7. Given an MDP, the return function restricted to possible and initial trajectories,  $G_{\xi}$ , determines  $R$  up to zero-initial potential shaping and a mask of unreachable transitions.

The limited invariance of the return of fragments arises because this restricted domain still includes individual (possible) transitions. Additional invariances will arise from additional restrictions, such as a minimum or maximum fragment length, or a restriction to initial trajectory fragments.

Pairwise comparisons between trajectories are studied as a data source for reward learning (Akrour et al., 2012; Christiano et al., 2017). It is common to model the comparisons as based on the return of trajectories, but with accompanying decision noise following a Boltzmann distribution. Under this assumption, in the limit of infinite noisy comparisons for each pair of trajectories, the data source reveals the Boltzmann distributions. Boltzmann noise encodes relative cardinal information about the return of trajectories and fragments, so little invariance is introduced.

Formally, given an MDP and an inverse temperature parameter  $\beta > 0$ , let  $\preceq_{\beta}^{\zeta}$  be a distribution over each pair of possible trajectory fragments,  $\zeta_1, \zeta_2$ , such that

$$
\mathbb {P} \left(\zeta_ {1} \preceq_ {\beta} ^ {\zeta} \zeta_ {2}\right) = \frac {\exp \left(\beta G \left(\zeta_ {2}\right)\right)}{\exp \left(\beta G \left(\zeta_ {1}\right)\right) + \exp \left(\beta G \left(\zeta_ {2}\right)\right)},
$$

and let  $\preceq_{\beta}^{\xi}$  be the analogous distribution over each pair of possible and initial trajectories.

Theorem 3.8. Given an MDP, the distribution of comparisons of possible trajectory fragments,  $\preceq_{\beta}^{\zeta}$ , determines  $R$  up to a mask of impossible transitions.

Theorem 3.9. Given an MDP, the distribution of comparisons of possible and initial trajectories,  $\preceq_{\beta}^{\xi}$ , determines  $R$  up to  $k$ -initial potential shaping and a mask of unreachable transitions.

The limited invariance of Boltzmann comparisons of fragments arises from the very flexible comparisons permitted, including, for example, comparisons between individual transitions and empty trajectories. Additional invariances will arise from additional restrictions, such as permitting comparisons only between fragments of a fixed length. Moreover, it is worth reiterating that these invariances rely heavily on the precise structure of the decision noise revealing cardinal information in the infinite-data limit.

It is also possible to model trajectory comparisons as noiseless comparisons based on the return. The infinite data limit then corresponds to the order induced by the return functions. Formally, define the noiseless order of possible trajectory fragments as a relation,  $\preceq_{\star}^{\zeta}$ , on possible trajectory fragments:

$$
\zeta_ {1} \preceq_ {\star} ^ {\zeta} \zeta_ {2} \Leftrightarrow G (\zeta_ {1}) \leqslant G (\zeta_ {2}).
$$

Similarly, define the noiseless order of possible and initial trajectories as the analogous relation,  $\preceq_{\star}^{\xi}$ , for pairs of possible and initial trajectories. These relations omit cardinal information about pairwise comparisons, and so invariances to certain monotonic transformations are introduced. The precise monotonic invariances depend on the MDP.

Theorem 3.10. We have the following bounds on the invariances of the noiseless order of possible trajectory fragments,  $\lesssim_{\star}^{\zeta}$ . In all MDPs:

(1)  $\preceq_{\star}^{\zeta}$  is invariant to positive linear scaling and a mask of impossible transitions; and  
(2)  $\preceq_{\star}^{\zeta}$  is not invariant to transformations other than zero-preserving monotonic transformations or masks of impossible transitions.

Moreover, there exist MDPs attaining each of these bounds.

We give a lower bound on the invariances of the noiseless order of possible and initial trajectories,  $\preceq_{\star}^{\xi}$ . Since  $\preceq_{\star}^{\xi}$  can be derived from  $\preceq_{\beta}^{\xi}$ , it inherits the latter's invariances. Moreover, like  $\preceq_{\star}^{\zeta}, \preceq_{\star}^{\xi}$  is always invariant to positive linear scaling.

Theorem 3.11. Given an MDP, the noiseless order of possible and initial trajectories,  $\preceq_{\star}^{\xi}$ , is invariant to  $k$ -initial potential shaping, positive linear scaling, and a mask of unreachable transitions.

# 3.3 INVARIANCES OF POLICY OPTIMISATION

The primary application of learnt reward functions is to compute optimal policies, using techniques such as RL. Policy optimisation procedures typically compute a single optimal policy. However, in terms of invariances, one may desire to preserve the whole set of optimal policies, so as not to tolerate any sub-optimal policies becoming optimal through a reward transformation.

The set of optimal policies inherits  $S'$ -redistribution invariance from the optimal  $Q$ -function, and is also known to be invariant to potential shaping (Ng et al., 1999). In fact, because a maximally supportive optimal policy can be derived from the set of optimal policies and vice versa, the set shares the same invariances as a maximally supportive optimal policy (Theorem 3.3).

Theorem 3.12. Given an MDP, let  $\mathcal{O}(s) = \arg \max_{a} A_{\star}(s, a)$ . Then the set of optimal policies determines  $R$  up to optimality-preserving transformations with  $\mathcal{O}$ .

Moreover, if one uses an algorithm not guaranteed to find a globally optimal policy, one may desire to preserve the entire order induced on the space of policies by the policy evaluation function, rather than just the set of maximising policies. Future work could investigate the invariances of the ordinal information in the policy evaluation function. Note that since the set of optimal policies can be derived from this order, the order has at most the invariances of the set of optimal policies.

Finally, we sketch some bounds on the invariances of the set of optimal policies across all MDPs. Potential shaping and linear scaling preserve optimal policies in each MDP, and hence in all MDPs.  $S^{\prime}$ -redistribution and optimality-preserving transformations for a given MDP might not. Moreover, Theorem 3.12 implies that any transformation that is not an optimality-preserving transformation in a given MDP cannot preserve optimal policies in that MDP, let alone all MDPs.

So far we have catalogued the invariances of transformations to the reward function of various reward function derived objects. These invariances characterise the infinite-data ambiguity of several reward learning data sources, and the ambiguity tolerance of policy optimisation. In this section, we discuss the implications for the practical evaluation of reward learning data sources.

The characterisation of ambiguity and tolerance as invariances to reward transformations suggests a natural partial order on data sources and applications. Recall that the invariances of an object correspond to a partition of the space of reward functions (section 2). We lift the refinement relation for partitions (Aigner, 1979, §I.2.B) to data sources and applications as follows.

Definition 4.1 (Ambiguity refinement). Consider two reward learning data sources (or applications),  $X$  and  $Y$ . Let  $\Pi_{X}$  and  $\Pi_{Y}$  be the partitions of the space of reward functions corresponding to their respective invariances (definition 2.1). If  $\Pi_{X}$  is a partition refinement of  $\Pi_{Y}$ , we write  $X \preceq Y$  and we say  $X$  is no more ambiguous than  $Y$  (or  $X$  is tolerable for application  $Y$ ). If  $X \preceq Y$  but not  $Y \preceq X$ , then we write  $X < Y$  and say  $X$  is (strictly) less ambiguous than  $Y$ .

Given two data sources  $X$  and  $Y$ ,  $X \preceq Y$  corresponds to  $X$  conflating no additional reward functions compared to  $Y$  in the infinite-data limit. This is the sense in which we say  $X$  is no more

ambiguous than  $Y$ . Moreover, given a downstream application  $Z$ ,  $X \preceq Z$  is precisely the condition of  $Z$  tolerating the infinite-data ambiguity of data source  $X$ :  $X \preceq Z$  if and only if the reward functions conflated by  $X$  in the infinite-data limit all lead to the same outcome in  $Z$ .

Of our fundamental reward functions transformations, there are several clear instances of ambiguity refinement in a given MDP, as summarised in figure 1b. Invariance to  $k$ -initial potential shaping  $(k-\Phi)$  corresponds to less ambiguity than general potential shaping  $(\Phi)$ . Likewise positive linear scaling (PLS) is less ambiguous than zero-preserving monotonic transformations (ZPMT), and a mask of impossible transitions is less ambiguous than  $S'$ -redistribution  $(S'R)$ . All of these transformations are less ambiguous than the optimality-preserving transformations we have encountered.

More concretely, we can compare the ambiguity of specific data sources. Some of these comparisons are indicated in figure 1a. For example, the ambiguity tolerance of the set of optimal policies is a class of optimality-preserving transformations. Each of the data sources that are less ambiguous than this tolerance are sufficient for policy optimisation.

Notably, this excludes noiseless comparisons between trajectory fragments in some MDPs. Specifically, policy optimisation does not, in general, tolerate zero-preserving monotonic transformations (ZPMT), while noiseless comparisons are invariant to this transformation in some MDPs (Theorem 3.10). Policy optimisation also does not tolerate data sources based on possible and initial trajectories, which are invariant to a mask of unreachable transitions. However, these sources are tolerable if the application only requires optimal behaviour in reachable states.

Moreover, we can compare data sources drawn from one MDP to applications in another MDP, such as under a shift in transition dynamics or initial state distribution. This captures the common sim-to-real setting where learning takes place in a simulated or otherwise restricted environment that differs from the final deployment environment. The simplest transformations to consider are masks of possible or reachable transitions. These are parametrised by transition dynamics. In general, the ambiguity corresponding to a mask of  $\mathcal{X}$  is less than for a mask of  $\mathcal{X}' \supset \mathcal{X}$ . For example, if the new dynamics supports transitions that were previously impossible, then sources with invariance to a mask from the original MDP may not be tolerable for applications in the new MDP.

A similar results hold for  $S'$ -redistribution, which involves an expectation over MDP dynamics. As an extreme example, we prove that when the transition dynamics are changed for every state and action,  $S'$ -redistribution under the original dynamics permits an arbitrary  $Q$ -function under the new dynamics. Naturally, data sources derived from  $Q$ -functions may also be affected by shifts in dynamics. Note that this strong result relies on the formulation of rewards as depending on the successor-state (cf. appendix C).

Theorem 4.1. Consider an MDP  $(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},\tau ,\mu_0,R,\gamma)$ , a policy  $\pi$ , and alternative transition dynamics  $\tau'$  with  $\tau(s,a)\neq \tau'(s,a)$  for all  $s\in S,a\in \mathcal{A}$ . Given a function  $Q':\mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{A}\to \mathbb{R}$ , there exists a reward function  $R'$ , produced from  $R$  by  $S'$ -redistribution under  $\tau$ , such that  $Q'$  is the  $Q$ -function for  $\pi$  under  $R'$  and  $\tau'$ .

Ambiguity refinement is a partial order, and some data sources are indeed incomparable. In consolation, we observe that such incomparable ambiguity is complementary ambiguity, in that by combining the associated data sources, we reduce overall ambiguity about the latent reward.

Theorem 4.2. Given data sources  $X$  and  $Y$ , let  $(X, Y)$  denote the combined data source formed from  $X$  and  $Y$ . If  $X$  and  $Y$  are incomparable, then  $(X, Y) < X$  and  $(X, Y) < Y$ .

This perspective highlights promising directions for the design of reward learning data sources. In particular, this suggests developing reward learning algorithms for mixtures of data sources with complementary ambiguity. Unfortunately, most popular data sources actually appear to have similar kinds of ambiguity given one MDP. However, ambiguity could be reduced by incorporating data from multiple MDPs, along the lines of Amin et al. (2017) and Cao et al. (2021).

# 5 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Our results give an upper bound on the amount of information that can be extracted from a given data source. However, in practice, these bounds may not be reached. In particular, our results are for the limit of infinite data. But in practice data sets are finite and, when data collection is expensive, may be fairly small. An important direction for future work is to characterise how much information is

contained in data sets of varying sizes and data sources. This would enable practitioners to determine the most sample efficient data source for a fixed data collection budget.

Furthermore, our results rely on the data being generated according to the process assumed by the reward learning algorithm. However, most popular approaches are a poor fit for human data (Orsini et al., 2021). For example, human demonstrations are rarely perfectly optimal or Boltzmannrational. Moreover, there is often a trade-off between how informative a data source is and how easy it is for a user to provide data. As an extreme example, a user directly specifying the target reward function is maximally informative - if users could complete such a task correctly. We expect the maximum informativeness of a data source to be a useful metric, but it should be considered alongside the cost and tractability of collecting different kinds of data.

# 6 CONCLUSION

Substantial effort has been invested to develop reward learning algorithms for a variety of data sources. A fundamental question to ask is how effective are these algorithms relative to an optimal algorithm for that data source? Our results characterise the information available in different data sources, enabling algorithms to be compared to this theoretical upper bound.

Moreover, our framework enables direct comparisons between different data sources. We find that some data sources are strictly less informative than others, such as noiseless preference comparisons vs. return labels. By contrast, others are incomparable and have complementary ambiguity, such as  $Q$ -values (invariant to  $S'$ -redistribution but not potential shaping) vs. episode return  $G_{\xi}$  (invariant to some potential shaping, but not to  $S'$ -redistribution).

In particular, we have characterised the invariances of various reward-related objects to transformations such as potential shaping. We have shown that these objects form a partial order under ambiguity refinement. These results, summarised in figure 1, allow us to predict the ambiguity of data sources generated from these objects. While practitioners could simply collect data from the least ambiguous source, this might be very expensive. Our framework also identifies the ambiguity tolerance of downstream applications (such as policy optimisation) that need to compute these objects. This enables practitioners to identify reward learning data sources with low ambiguity in the areas their application is sensitive to, enabling higher performance without unnecessary costs.

# ETHICS STATEMENT

It is important that AI systems are aligned with the interests of users and other stakeholders. In open-ended problems, directly specifying how the AI system should behave is intractable. Prior work has identified reward learning as an essential building block for AI systems that can cooperate with humans (Dafoe et al., 2020, §4.1.3), especially for powerful AI systems (Bostrom, 2014, chapter 12). We hope that our work provides greater clarity on both the limits and potential of various reward learning data sources. However, given the importance of the domain, we should stress that our work provides only one useful angle by which to evaluate data sources. In particular, we do not consider sample efficiency, robustness to misspecification, or the cost of data collection.

Moreover, even if a theoretically optimal and practically robust reward learning algorithm were to be developed, there would still remain important normative questions. In particular, what kinds of values we are aligning the AI system to – stated preferences, revealed preferences, instructions, or something else (Gabriel, 2020)? Additionally, it is important that all relevant stakeholders are able to provide input into the system. This may constrain the kinds of data we can collect. For example, while only task experts might be able to provide demonstrations, a wider variety of stakeholders might be able to provide preference comparisons. While a thorough evaluation of these considerations are beyond the scope of this paper, we would encourage practitioners to evaluate reward learning data sources holistically, including but not wholly relying on our results.
