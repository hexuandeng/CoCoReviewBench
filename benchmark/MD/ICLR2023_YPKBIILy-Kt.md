# ABSTRACT

This paper investigates a missing feature imputation problem for graph learning tasks. Several methods have previously addressed learning tasks on graphs with missing features. However, in cases of high rates of missing features, they were unable to avoid significant performance degradation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel concept of channel-wise confidence in a node feature, which is assigned to each imputed channel feature of a node for reflecting certainty of the imputation. We then design pseudo-confidence using the channel-wise shortest path distance between a missing-feature node and its nearest known-feature node to replace unavailable true confidence in an actual learning process. Based on the pseudo-confidence, we propose a novel feature imputation scheme that performs channel-wise inter-node diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation. The scheme can endure even at an exceedingly high missing rate (e.g.,  $99.5\%$ ) and it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for both semi-supervised node classification and link prediction on various datasets containing a high rate of missing features.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have received considerable attention and have performed outstandingly on numerous problems across multiple fields (Zhou et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). While various GNNs handling attributed graphs are designed for node representation (Deferrard et al., 2016; Kipf & Welling, 2016a; Velickovic et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018) and graph representation learning (Kipf & Welling, 2016b; Sun et al., 2019; Velickovic et al., 2019), GNN models typically assume that features of all nodes are fully observed. In real-world situations, however, features in graph-structured data are often partially observed, as illustrated in the following cases. First, collecting complete data for a large graph is prohibitively expensive or even impossible. Second, measurement failure is common. Third, in social networks, most users desire to protect their personal information selectively. As data security regulation continues to tighten around the world (GDPR), access to full data is expected to become increasingly difficult. Under these circumstances, most GNNs cannot be applied directly due to incomplete features.

Several methods have been proposed to solve learning tasks with graphs containing missing features (Jiang & Zhang, 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Taguchi et al., 2021), but they suffer from significant performance degradation at high rates of missing features. A recent work by (Rossi et al., 2021) demonstrated improved performance by introducing feature propagation (FP), which iteratively propagates known features among the nodes along edges. However, even FP cannot avoid a considerable accuracy drop at an extremely high missing rate (e.g.,  $99.5\%$ ). We assume that it is because FP simply diffuses extremely-sparse known features, which can lead to imputation of overly-smoothed features. Consequently, overly-smoothed features can not provide discriminative information for downstream tasks.

Therefore, to better impute the missing features in graph, we propose to consider both inter-channel and inter-node relationships so that we can effectively exploit the sparsely known features. To this end, we design an elaborate feature imputation scheme that includes two processes. The first process is the feature recovery via channel-wise inter-node diffusion, and the second is the feature refinement via node-wise inter-channel propagation. The first process diffuses features by assigning different importance to each recovered channel feature, in contrast to usual diffusion. To this end, we introduce a novel concept of channel-wise confidence, which reflects the quality of channel feature

recovery. This confidence is also used in the second process for channel feature refinement based on highly confident feature by utilizing the inter-channel correlation.

The true confidence in a missing channel feature is inaccessible without every actual feature. Thus, we define pseudo-confidence for use in our scheme instead of true confidence. Using channel-wise confidence further refines the less confident channel feature by aggregating the highly confident channel features in each node or through the highly confident channel features diffused from neighboring nodes.

The key contribution of our work is summarized as follows: (1) we propose a new concept of channel-wise confidence that represents the quality of a recovered channel feature. (2) We design a method to provide pseudo-confidence that can be used in place of unavailable true confidence in a missing channel feature. (3) Based on the pseudo-confidence, we propose a novel feature imputation scheme that achieves the state-of-the-art performance for node classification and link prediction even in an extremely high rate (e.g.,  $99.5\%$ ) of missing features.

# 2.1 LEARNING ON GRAPHS WITH MISSING NODE FEATURES

The problem with missing data has been widely investigated in the literature (Allison, 2001; Loh & Wainwright, 2011; Little & Rubin, 2019; You et al., 2020). Recently, focusing on graph-structured data with pre-defined connectivity, there have been several attempts to learn graphs with missing node features. (Monti et al., 2017) proposed recurrent multi-graph convolutional neural networks (RMGCNN) and separable RMGCNN (sRMGCNN), a scalable version of RMGCNN. Structure-attribute transformer (SAT) (Chen et al., 2020) models the joint distribution of graph structures and node attributes through distribution techniques, then completes missing node attributes. GCN for missing features (GCNMF) (Taguchi et al., 2021) adapts graph convolutional networks (GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2016a) to graphs that contain missing node features via representing the missing features using the Gaussian mixture model. Meanwhile, a partial graph neural network (PaGNN) (Jiang & Zhang, 2020) leverages a partial message-propagation scheme that considers only known features during propagation. However, these methods experience large performance degradation when there exists a high feature missing rate. Feature propagation (FP) (Rossi et al., 2021) reconstructs missing features by diffusing known features. However, in diffusion of FP, a missing feature is formed by aggregating features from neighboring nodes regardless of whether a feature is known or inferred. Moreover, FP does not consider any interdependency among feature channels. To utilize relationships among channels, we construct a correlation matrix of recovered features and additionally refine the features.

# 2.2 DISTANCEENCODING

Distance encoding (DE) on graphs defines extra features using distance from a node to the node set where the prediction is made. (Zhang & Chen, 2018) extracts a local enclosing subgraph around each target node pair, and uses GNN to learn graph structure features for link prediction. (Li et al., 2020) exploits structure-related features called DE that encodes distance between a node and its neighboring node set with graph-distance measures (e.g., shortest path distance or generalized PageRank scores (Li et al., 2019)). (Zhang et al., 2021) unifies the aforementioned techniques into a labeling trick. Heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) (Ji et al., 2021) proposes a heterogeneous distance encoding in consideration of multiple types of paths in enclosing subgraphs of heterogeneous graphs. Distance encoding in existing methods improves the representation power of GNNs. We use distance encoding to distinguish missing features based on the shortest path distance from a missing feature to known features in the same channel.

# 2.3 GRAPH DIFFUSION

Diffusion on graphs spreads the feature of each node to its neighboring nodes along the edges (Coifman & Lafon, 2006; Shuman et al., 2013; Guille et al., 2013). There are two types of transition matrices commonly used for diffusion on graphs: symmetric transition matrix (Kipf & Welling, 2016a; Klicpera et al., 2019; Rossi et al., 2021) and random walk matrix (Page et al., 1999; Chung,

Figure 1: Overall scheme of the proposed Pseudo-Confidence-based Feature Imputation (PCFI) method. Based on the graph structure and partially known features, we calculate the channel-wise shortest path distance between a node with a missing feature and its nearest source node (SPDS). Based on SPD-S, we determine the pseudo-confidence in the recovered feature, using a predetermined hyper-parameter  $\alpha$  ( $0 < \alpha < 1$ ). Pseudo-confidence plays an important role in the two stages: channel-wise Inter-node diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation.

2007; Perozzi et al., 2014; Grover & Leskovec, 2016; Atwood & Towsley, 2016; Klicpera et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2021). While these matrices work well for each target task, from a node's perspective, the sum of edge weights for aggregating features is not one in general. Therefore, since features are not updated at the same scale of original features, these matrices are not suitable for missing feature recovery.

# 3 PROPOSED METHOD

# 3.1 OVERVIEW

We address a problem with graph learning tasks containing missing node features. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature imputation, we target two main graph learning tasks. The first target task, semi-supervised node classification, is to infer the labels of the unlabeled nodes from the partially known features/labels and the fully known graph structure. The second target task, link prediction, is to predict whether two nodes are likely to share a link. Figure 1 depicts the overall scheme of the proposed feature imputation. Our key idea is to assign different pseudo-confidence to each imputed channel features. To this end, the proposed imputation scheme includes two processes. The first process is the feature recovery via channel-wise inter-node diffusion, and the second is the feature refinement via node-wise inter-channel propagation. The imputed features obtained from the two processes are used for downstream tasks via off-the-shelf GNNs.

In Sec. 3.2, we begin by introducing the notations used in this paper. In Sec. 3.3, we outline the proposed PC (pseudo-confidence)-based feature imputation (PCFI) scheme that imputes missing node features. We then propose a method to determine the pseudo-confidence in Sec. 3.4. In Sec. 3.5, we present channel-wise inter-node diffusion that iteratively propagates known features with consideration of PC. In Sec. 3.6, we present node-wise inter-channel propagation that adjusts features based on correlation coefficients between channels.

# 3.2 NOTATIONS

Basic notation on graphs. An undirected connected graph is represented as  $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E},\mathbf{A})$  where  $\mathcal{V} = \{v_i\}_{i=1}^N$  is the set of  $N$  nodes,  $\mathcal{E}$  is the edge set with  $(v_i,v_j) \in \mathcal{E}$ , and  $\mathbf{A} \in \{0,1\}^{N \times N}$  denotes an adjacency matrix.  $\mathbf{X} = [x_{i,d}] \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times F}$  is a node feature matrix with  $N$  nodes and  $F$  channels, i.e.,  $x_{i,d}$ , the  $d$ -th channel value of the node  $v_i$ .  $\mathcal{N}(v_i)$  denotes the set of neighbors of  $v_i$ . Given an arbitrary matrix  $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ , we let  $M_{i,j}$  denote the  $i$ -th row vector of  $M$ . Similarly, we let  $M_{i,j}$  denote the  $j$ -th column vector of  $M$ .

Notation for graphs with missing node features. As we assume that partial or even very few node features are known, we define  $\mathcal{V}_k^{(d)}$  as a set of nodes where the  $d$ -th channel feature values are known ( $k$  in  $\mathcal{V}_k^{(d)}$  means 'known'). The set of nodes with the unknown  $d$ -th channel feature values

is denoted by  $\mathcal{V}_u^{(d)} = \mathcal{V} \setminus \mathcal{V}_k^{(d)}$ . Then  $\mathcal{V}_k^{(d)}$  and  $\mathcal{V}_u^{(d)}$  are referred to source nodes and missing nodes, respectively. By reordering the nodes according to whether a feature value is known or not for the  $d$ -th channel, we can write graph signal for the  $d$ -th channel features and adjacency matrix as:

$$
\boldsymbol {x} ^ {(d)} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \boldsymbol {x} _ {k} ^ {(d)} \\ \boldsymbol {x} _ {u} ^ {(d)} \end{array} \right] \qquad \boldsymbol {A} ^ {(d)} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} \boldsymbol {A} _ {k k} ^ {(d)} & \boldsymbol {A} _ {k u} ^ {(d)} \\ \boldsymbol {A} _ {u k} ^ {(d)} & \boldsymbol {A} _ {u u} ^ {(d)} \end{array} \right].
$$

Here,  $\pmb{x}^{(d)}, \pmb{x}_k^{(d)}$ , and  $\pmb{x}_u^{(d)}$  are column vectors that represent corresponding graph signal. Since the graph is undirected,  $\pmb{A}^{(d)}$  is symmetric and thus  $(A_{ku}^{(d)})^\top = A_{uk}^{(d)}$ . Note that  $\pmb{A}^{(d)}$  is different from  $\pmb{A}$  due to reordering while they represent the same graph structure.  $\hat{\pmb{X}} = [\hat{x}_{i,d}]$  denotes recovered features for  $\pmb{X}$  from  $\{\pmb{x}_k^{(d)}\}_{d=1}^F$  and  $\{\pmb{A}^{(d)}\}_{d=1}^F$ .

# 3.3 PC-BASED FEATURE IMPUTATION

The proposed PC-based feature imputation (PCFI) scheme leverages the shortest path distance between nodes to compute pseudo-confidence. PCFI consists of two stages: channel-wise inter-node diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation. The first stage, channel-wise inter-node diffusion, finds  $\hat{X}$  (recovered features for  $X$ ) through PC-based feature diffusion on a given graph  $\mathcal{G}$ . Then, the second stage, node-wise inter-channel, refines  $\hat{X}$  to the final imputed features  $\tilde{X}$  by considering PC and correlation between channels.

To perform node classification and link prediction, a GNN is trained with imputed node features  $\tilde{\pmb{X}}$ . In this work, PCFI is designed to perform the downstream tasks well. However, since PCFI is independent of the type of learning task, PCFI is not limited to the two tasks. Therefore, it can be applied to various graph learning tasks with missing node features.

Formally, the proposed framework can be expressed as

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {X}} = f _ {1} \left(\left\{\boldsymbol {x} _ {k} ^ {(d)} \right\} _ {d = 1} ^ {F}, \left\{\boldsymbol {A} ^ {(d)} \right\} _ {d = 1} ^ {F}\right) \tag {1a}
$$

$$
\tilde {\boldsymbol {X}} = f _ {2} (\hat {\boldsymbol {X}}) \tag {1b}
$$

$$
\tilde {\boldsymbol {Y}} = g _ {\theta} (\tilde {\boldsymbol {X}}, \boldsymbol {A}), \tag {1c}
$$

where  $f_{1}$  is channel-wise inter-node diffusion,  $f_{2}$  is node-wise inter-channel propagation, and  $\hat{Y}$  is a prediction for desired output of a given task. Here, PCFI is expressed as  $f_{2} \circ f_{1}$ , and any GNN architecture can be adopted as  $g_{\theta}$  according to the type of task.

# 3.4 PSEUDO-CONFIDENCE

We begin by defining the concept of confidence in the recovered feature  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  of a node  $v_{i}$  for channel  $d$  in the first process.

Definition 1. Confidence in the recovered channel feature  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  is defined by similarity between  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  and true one  $x_{i,d}$ , which is a value between 0 and 1.

Note that the feature  $x_{i,d}$  of a source node is observed and thus its confidence becomes 1. When the recovered  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  is far from the true  $x_{i,d}$ , the confidence in  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  will decrease towards 0. However, it is a chicken and egg problem to determine  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  and its confidence. That is, the confidence in  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  is unavailable before attaining  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  according to Definition 1, whereas the proposed scheme can not yield  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  without the confidence.

To navigate this issue, instead of true confidence, we design a pseudo-confidence using the shortest path distance between a node and its nearest source node for a specific channel (SPD-S). For instance, SPD-S of the  $i$ -th node for the  $d$ -th channel feature is denoted by  $S_{i,d}$ , which is calculated via

$$
\boldsymbol {S} _ {i, d} = s \left(v _ {i} \mid \mathcal {V} _ {k} ^ {(d)}, \boldsymbol {A} ^ {(d)}\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $s(\cdot)$  yields the shortest path distance between the  $i$ -th node and its nearest source node in  $\mathcal{V}_k^{(d)}$  on  $\pmb{A}^{(d)}$ . It is notable that, if the  $i$ -th node is a source node, its nearest source node is itself, meaning  $\pmb{S}_{i,d}$  becomes zero. We construct SPD-S matrix  $S \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times F}$  of which elements are  $\pmb{S}_{i,d}$ .

Consider  $\hat{\pmb{X}} = [\hat{x}_{i,d}]$  that represents the recovered features of  $\pmb{X}$  with consideration of feature homophily (McPherson et al., 2001) that represents a local property on a graph (Bisgin et al., 2010; Lauw et al., 2010; Bisgin et al., 2012). Based on the feature homophily, the feature similarity between any two nodes tends to increase as the shortest path distance between the two nodes decreases (see Figure 6 in APPENDIX). In turn, the recovered feature  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  of a node  $v_{i}$  more confidently becomes similar to the given feature of its nearest source node as SPD-S of  $v_{i}$  ( $S_{i,d}$ ) decreases.

Based on this homophily, we define pseudo-confidence using SPD-S in Definition 2.

Definition 2. Pseudo-confidence (PC) in  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  is defined by a function  $\xi_{i,d} = \alpha^{\mathbf{S}_{i,d}}$  where  $\alpha \in (0,1)$  is a hyper-parameter.

By Definition 2, PC becomes 1 for  $\hat{x}_{i,d} = x_{i,d}$  on source nodes. Moreover, PC decreases exponentially for a missing node features as  $S_{i,d}$  increases. Likewise, PC reflects the tendency toward confidence in Definition 1. We verified that this tendency exists regardless of imputation methods via experiments on real datasets. Therefore, pseudo-confidence using SPD-S is properly designed to replace confidence.

# 3.5 CHANNEL-WISE INTER-NODE DIFFUSION

To recover missing node features in a channel-wise manner via graph diffusion, source nodes independently propagate their features to their neighbors for each channel. Instead of simple aggregating all neighborhood features with the same weights, our scheme aggregates features with different importance according to their confidence. As a result, the recovered features of missing nodes are aggregated in low-confidence and the given features of source nodes are aggregated in high-confidence, which is our design objective. To this end, we design a novel diffusion matrix based on the pseudo-confidence.

For the design, Definition 3 first defines 'Relative PC' that represents an amount of PC in a particular node feature relative to another node feature.

Definition 3. Relative PC of  $\hat{x}_{j,d}$  relative to  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  is defined by  $\xi_{j / i,d} = \xi_{j,d} / \xi_{i,d} = \alpha^{S_{j,d} - S_{i,d}}$ .

Then, suppose that a missing node feature  $x_{i,d}$  of  $v_{i}$  aggregates features from  $v_{j} \in \mathcal{N}(v_{i})$ . If  $v_{i}$  and  $v_{j}$  are neighborhoods to each other, the difference between SPD-S of  $v_{i}$  and SPD-S of  $v_{j}$  cannot exceed 1. Hence, the relative PC of a node to its neighbor can be determined using Proposition 1.

Proposition 1. If  $S_{i,d} = m \geq 1$ ,  $v_i$  is a missing node, then  $\xi_{j / i,d}$  for  $v_j \in \mathcal{N}(v_i)$  is given by

$$
\xi_ {j / i, d} = \alpha^ {- 1} i f S _ {i, d} > S _ {j, d},
$$

$$
\xi_ {j / i, d} = 1 \text {i f} \boldsymbol {S} _ {i, d} = \boldsymbol {S} _ {j, d},
$$

$$
\xi_ {j / i, d} = \alpha i f S _ {i, d} <   S _ {j, d},
$$

Otherwise,  $v_{i}$  is a source node  $(S_{i,d} = 0)$ , then  $\xi_{j / i,d}$  for  $v_{j} \in \mathcal{N}(v_{i})$  is given by

$$
\begin{array}{r c l} \xi_ {j / i, d} & = & 1 \text {i f} v _ {j} \text {i s a s o u r c e n o d e} (\boldsymbol {S} _ {j, d} = 1), \end{array}
$$

$$
\xi_ {j / i, d} = \alpha i f v _ {j} i s a m i s s i n g n o d e (\boldsymbol {S} _ {j, d} = 0).
$$

The proof of Proposition 1 is given in Appendix A.1.

Before defining a transition matrix, we temporarily reorder nodes according to whether a feature value is known for the  $d$ -th channel, i.e.,  $\pmb{x}^{(d)}$  and  $\pmb{A}^{(d)}$  are reordered for each channel as Section 3.2 describes. After the feature diffusion stage, we order the nodes according to the original numbering.

Built on Proposition 1, we construct a weighted adjacency matrix  $\mathbf{W}^{(d)}$  for the  $d$ -th channel.  $\mathbf{W}^{(d)} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$  is defined as follows,

$$
\boldsymbol {W} _ {i, j} ^ {(d)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \xi_ {j / i, d} & \text {i f} i \neq j, \boldsymbol {A} _ {i, j} ^ {(d)} = 1 \\ 0 & \text {i f} i \neq j, \boldsymbol {A} _ {i, j} ^ {(d)} = 0 \\ 1 & \text {i f} i = j. \end{array} \right. \tag {3}
$$

Note that self-loops are added to  $\mathbf{W}^{(d)}$  with a weight of 1 so that each node can keep some of its own feature.

$W_{i,j}^{d}$  is an edge weight corresponding to message passing from  $v_{j}$  to  $v_{i}$ . Proposition 1 implies that  $\alpha^{-1}$  is assigned to high-PC neighbors, 1 to same-PC, and  $\alpha$  to low-PC neighbors. That is,  $W^{(d)}$  allows a node to aggregate high PC more than low PC channel features from its neighbors. Furthermore, consider message passing between two connected nodes  $v_{i}$  and  $v_{j}$  s.t.  $W_{i,j}^{(d)} = \xi_{j / i,d} = \alpha$ . By Definition 3,  $\xi_{i / j,d} = \xi_{j / i,d}^{-1}$ , so that  $W_{j,i}^{(d)} = (W_{i,j}^{(d)})^{-1} = \alpha^{-1}$ . This means that message passing from a high confident node to a low confident node occurs in a large amount, while message passing in the opposite direction occurs in a small amount. The hyper-parameter  $\alpha$  tunes the strength of message passing depending on the confidence.

To ensure convergence of diffusion process, we normalize  $\pmb{W}^{(d)}$  to  $\overline{\pmb{W}}^{(d)} = (\pmb{D}^{(d)})^{-1}\pmb{W}^{(d)}$  through row-stochastic normalization with  $D_{ii}^{(d)} = \sum_{j} W_{i,j}$ . Since  $x_k^d$  with true feature values should be preserved, we replace the first  $|\mathcal{V}^{(d)}|$  rows of  $\overline{\pmb{W}}^{(d)}$  with one-hot vectors indicating  $\nu_k^{(d)}$ . Finally, the channel-wise inter-node diffusion matrix  $\widehat{W}^{(d)}$  for the  $d$ -th channel is expressed as

$$
\widehat {\boldsymbol {W}} ^ {(d)} = \left[ \begin{array}{l l} \boldsymbol {I} & \mathbf {0} _ {k u} \\ \overline {{\boldsymbol {W}}} _ {u k} ^ {(d)} & \overline {{\boldsymbol {W}}} _ {u u} ^ {(d)} \end{array} \right], \tag {4}
$$

where  $\pmb{I} \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}_k^{(d)}| \times |\mathcal{V}_k^{(d)}|}$  is an identity matrix and  $\mathbf{0}_{ku} \in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{V}_k^{(d)}| \times |\mathcal{V}_u^{(d)}|}$  is a zero matrix. Note that  $\widehat{\pmb{W}}^{(d)}$  remains row-stochastic despite the replacement. An aggregation in a specific node can be regarded as a weighted sum of features on neighboring nodes. A row-stochastic matrix for transition matrix means that when a node aggregates features from its neighbors, the sum of the weights is 1. Therefore, unlike a symmetric transition matrix (Kipf & Welling, 2016a; Klicpera et al., 2019; Rossi et al., 2021) or a column-stochastic (random walk) transition matrix (Page et al., 1999; Chung, 2007; Perozzi et al., 2014; Grover & Leskovec, 2016; Atwood & Towsley, 2016; Klicpera et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2021), features of missing nodes can form at the same scale of known features. Preserving the original scale allows features to recover close to the actual features.

Now, we define channel-wise inter-node diffusion for the  $d$ -th channel as

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {x}} ^ {(d)} (0) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \boldsymbol {x} _ {k} ^ {(d)} \\ \boldsymbol {0} _ {u} \end{array} \right] \tag {5}
$$

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {x}} ^ {(d)} (t) = \widehat {\boldsymbol {W}} ^ {(d)} \hat {\boldsymbol {x}} ^ {(d)} (t - 1),
$$

where  $\hat{\pmb{x}}^{(d)}(t)$  is a recovered feature vector for  $\pmb{x}^{(d)}$  after  $t$  propagation steps,  $\mathbf{0}_u$  is a zero-column vector of size  $|\mathcal{V}_u^{(d)}|$ , and  $t\in [1,K]$ . Here we initialize missing feature values  $\pmb{x}_u^{(d)}$  to zero. As  $K\to \infty$ , this recursion converges (the proof is provided in Appendix A.2). We approximate the steady state to  $\hat{\pmb{x}}^{(d)}(K)$ , which is calculated by  $(\widehat{\pmb{W}}^{(d)})^K\hat{\pmb{x}}^{(d)}(0)$  with large enough  $K$ . The diffusion is performed for each channel and outputs  $\{\hat{\pmb{x}}^{(d)}(K)\}_{d = 1}^{F}$ .

Due to the reordering of nodes for each channel before the diffusion, node indices in  $\hat{\pmb{x}}^{(d)}(K)$  for  $d\in \{1,\dots ,F\}$  differ. Therefore, after unifying different ordering in each  $\hat{\pmb{x}}^{(d)}(K)$  according to the original order in  $\pmb{X}$ , we concatenate all  $\hat{\pmb{x}}^{(d)}(K)$  along the channels into  $\hat{\pmb{X}}$ , which is the final output in this stage.

# 3.6 NODE-WISE INTER-CHANNEL PROPAGATION

In the previous stage, we obtained  $\hat{\pmb{X}} = [\hat{x}_{i,d}]$  (recovered features for  $\pmb{X}$ ) via channel-wise internode diffusion performed separately for each channel. The proposed feature diffusion is enacted based on the graph structure and pseudo-confidence, but it does not consider dependency between channels. Since the dependency between channels can be another important factor for imputing missing node features, we develop an additional scheme to refine  $\hat{\pmb{X}}$  to improve the performance of downstream tasks by considering both channel correlation and pseudo-confidence. At this stage, within a node, a low-PC channel feature is refined by reflecting a high-PC channel feature according to the degree of correlation between the two channels.

We first prepare a correlation coefficient matrix  $\pmb{R} = [\pmb{R}_{a,b}] \in \mathbb{R}^{F \times F}$ , giving the correlation coefficient between each pair of channels for the proposed scheme.  $\pmb{R}_{a,b}$ , the correlation coefficient

between  $\hat{X}_{:,a}$  and  $\hat{X}_{:,b}$ , is calculated by

$$
\boldsymbol {R} _ {a, b} = \frac {\frac {1}{N - 1} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \left(\hat {x} _ {i , a} - m _ {a}\right) \left(\hat {x} _ {i , b} - m _ {b}\right)}{\sigma_ {a} \sigma_ {b}} \tag {6}
$$

where  $m_d = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\hat{x}_{i,d}$  and  $\sigma_d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\hat{x}_{i,d} - m_d)^2}$ .

In this stage, unlike looking across the nodes for each channel in the previous stage, we look across the channels for each node. As the right-hand graph of Figure 1 illustrates, we define fully connected directed graphs  $\{\mathcal{H}^{(i)}\}_{i = 1}^{N}$  called node-wise inter-channel propagation graphs from the given graph  $\mathcal{G}$ .  $\mathcal{H}^{(i)}$  for the  $i$ -th node in  $\mathcal{G}$  is defined by

$$
\mathcal {H} ^ {(i)} = \left(\mathcal {V} ^ {(i)}, \mathcal {E} ^ {(i)}, \boldsymbol {B} ^ {(i)}\right), \tag {7}
$$

where  $\mathcal{V}^{(i)} = \{v_d^{(i)}\}_{d=1}^F$  is a set of nodes in  $\mathcal{H}^{(i)}$ ,  $\mathcal{E}^{(i)}$  is a set of directed edges in  $\mathcal{H}^{(i)}$ , and  $\pmb{B}^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^{F \times F}$  is a weighted adjacency matrix for refining  $\hat{\pmb{X}}_{i,..}$ . To refine  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  of the  $i$ -th node via inter-channel propagation, we assign  $\hat{x}_{i,d}$  to each  $v_d^{(i)}$  as a scalar node feature for the  $d$ -th channel  $(d \in \{1, \dots, F\})$ . The weights in  $\mathcal{E}^{(i)}$  are given by  $\pmb{B}^{(i)}$  in (8).

We design  $B^{(i)}$  for inter-channel propagation in each node to achieve three goals: (1) highly correlated channels should exchange more information to each other than less correlated channels, (2) a low-PC channel feature should receive more information from other channels for refinement than a high-PC channel feature, and (3) a high PC channel feature should propagate more information to other node channels than a low PC channel feature. Based on these design goals, the weight of the directed edge from the  $b$ -th channel to the  $a$ -th channel  $(B_{a,b}^{(i)})$  in  $B^{(i)}$  is designed by

$$
\boldsymbol {B} _ {a, b} ^ {(i)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \beta \left(1 - \alpha^ {S _ {i, a}}\right) \alpha^ {S _ {i, b}} \boldsymbol {R} _ {a, b} & \text {i f} a \neq b \\ 0 & \text {i f} a = b \end{array} , \right. \tag {8}
$$

where  $R_{a,b}$ ,  $\alpha^{S_{i,b}}$ , and  $(1 - \alpha^{S_{i,a}})$  are the terms for meeting design goals (1), (2), and (3), respectively.  $\alpha$  is hyper-parameter for pseudo-confidence in Definition 2, and  $\beta$  is the scaling hyperparameter.

Node-wise inter-channel propagation on  $\mathcal{H}^{(i)}$  outputs the final imputed features for  $X_{i,}$  . We define node-wise inter-channel propagation as

$$
\tilde {\boldsymbol {X}} _ {i,:} ^ {\top} = \hat {\boldsymbol {X}} _ {i,:} ^ {\top} + \boldsymbol {B} ^ {(i)} \left(\hat {\boldsymbol {X}} _ {i,:} - [ m _ {1}, m _ {2}, \dots , m _ {F} ]\right) ^ {\top}, \tag {9}
$$

where  $\tilde{\pmb{X}}_{i,:}$  and  $\tilde{\pmb{X}}_{i,:}$  are row vectors. Preserving the pre-recovered channel feature values (as self loops), message passing among different channel features is conducted along the directed edges of  $\pmb{B}^{(i)}$ . After calculating  $\tilde{\pmb{X}}_{i,:}$  for  $i\in \{1,\dots,N\}$ , we obtain the final recovered features by concatenating them, i.e.,  $\tilde{\pmb{X}} = [\tilde{\pmb{X}}_{1,:}^{\top}\tilde{\pmb{X}}_{2,:}^{\top}\dots \tilde{\pmb{X}}_{N,:}^{\top}]^{\top}$ . Moreover, since  $\pmb{R}$  is calculated via recovered features  $\tilde{\pmb{X}}$  for all nodes in  $\mathcal{G}$ , channel correlation propagation injects global information into recovered features for  $\pmb{X}$ . In turn,  $\tilde{\pmb{X}}$  is a final output of PC-based feature imputation and is fed to GNN to solve a downstream task.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

To validate our method, we conducted experiments for two main graph learning tasks: semi-supervised node classification and link prediction.

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Datasets. We experimented with six benchmark datasets from two different domains: citation networks (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed (Sen et al., 2008) and OGBN-Arxiv (Hu et al., 2020)) and recommendation networks (Amazon-Computers and Amazon-Photo (Shchur et al., 2018)). For link prediction, we evaluated all methods on the five benchmark datasets except OGBN-Arxiv that was caused out of memory. The datasets are described in Appendix A.4.1.

Figure 2: Average accuracy  $(\%)$  on the six datasets with  $r_m \in \{0, 0.5, 0.9, 0.995\}$ . sRMGCNN and GCNMF are excepted due to OOM results in certain datasets and the significantly poor performance on all the available datasets, as table 1 shows.

Compared Methods. For semi-supervised node classification, we compared our method to two baselines and four state-of-the-art methods. we set Baseline 1 to a simple scheme that directly fed the graph data with missing features to GNN without recovery, where all missing values in a feature matrix were set to zero. We set Baseline 2 to label propagation (LP) (Zhu & Ghahramani, 2002) which does not use node features and propagates only partially-known labels for inferring the remaining labels. That is, LP corresponds to the case of  $100\%$  feature missing. The four state-of-the-art methods can be categorized into two approaches: GCN-variant model=\{GCNMF (Taguchi et al., 2021), PaGNN (Jiang & Zhang, 2020)\} and feature imputation=\{sRMGCNN (Monti et al., 2017), FP (Rossi et al., 2021)\}. While GCN-variant models were designed to perform node classification directly with partially known features, feature imputation methods combine with GNN models for downstream tasks. In Baseline 1, sRMGCNN, FP, and our method, we commonly used vanilla GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2016a) for the downstream task.

For link prediction, we compared our method with sRMGCNN and FP, which are the feature imputation approach. To perform link prediction on the imputed features by each method, graph autoencoder (GAE) (Kipf & Welling, 2016b) models were adopted. We used features inferred by each method as input of GAE models. We further compared against GCNMF (Taguchi et al., 2021) for link prediction. We report the detailed implementation in Appendix A.3.

Data Settings. Regardless of task type, we removed features according to missing rate  $r_m$  ( $0 < r_m < 1$ ). Missing features were selected in two ways.

- Structural missing. We first randomly selected nodes in a ratio of  $r_m$  among all nodes. Then, we assigned all features of the selected nodes to missing (unknown) values (zero).  
- Uniform missing. We randomly selected features in a ratio of  $r_m$  from the node feature matrix  $X$ , and we set the selected features to missing (unknown) values (zero).

For semi-supervised node classification, we randomly generated 10 different training/validation/test splits, except OGBN-Arxiv where the split was fixed according to the specified criteria. For link prediction, we also randomly generated 10 different training/validation/test splits for each datasets. We describe the generated splits in detail in Appendix A.4.2.

Hyper-parameters. Across all the compared methods, we tuned hyper-parameters based on validation set. For PCFI, we analyzed the influence of  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  in Appendix A.3.2. We used grid search to find the two hyper-parameters in the range of  $0 < \alpha < 1$  and  $0 < \beta \leq 1$  on validation sets. For the node classification,  $(\alpha, \beta)$  was determined by the best pair from  $\{(\alpha, \beta) | \alpha \in \{0.1, 0.2, \dots, 0.9\}, \beta \in \{10^{-6}, 10^{-5.5}, \dots, 1\}\}$ . For the link prediction, the best  $(\alpha, \beta)$  was searched from  $\{(\alpha, \beta) | \alpha \in \{0.1, 0.2, \dots, 0.9\}, \beta \in \{10^{-6}, 10^{-5}, \dots, 1\}\}$ , as shown in Figure 3, 4 of APPENDIX.

Ablation Study. We present the ablation study to show the effectiveness of each component (row-ST, CID, NIP) of PCFI in Appendix A.4.3.

# 4.2 SEMI-SUPERVISED NODE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS

Figure 2 demonstrates the trend of an average accuracy of compared methods for node classification on six datasets with different  $r_m$ . The performance gain of PCFI is remarkable at  $r_m = 0.995$ . In contrast, the average accuracy of existing methods rapidly decreases as  $r_m$  increases and are overtaken by LP which does not utilize features. In the case of uniform missing features, FP exhibits better resistance than LP, but the gap from ours increases as  $r_m$  increases.

Table 1 illustrates the detailed results of node classification with  $r_m = 0.995$ . sRMGCNN and GCNMF show significantly low performance for all experiments in this extremely challenging environment. Baseline 2 (LP) outperforms PaGNN in general, and even FP shows worse accuracy than Baseline 2 (LP) in certain settings. For all the datasets, PCFI performed in a manner that was superior to the other methods at  $r_m = 0.995$ .

# 4.3 LINK PREDICTION RESULTS

Table 2 demonstrates the results for the link prediction task at  $r_m = 0.995$ . PCFI achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings except PubMed with structural missing. Based on the results on semi-supervised node classification and link prediction, which are representative graph learning tasks, PCFI shows the effectiveness at a very high rate of missing features.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We introduced a novel concept of channel-wise confidence to impute highly rated missing features in a graph. To replace the unavailable true confidence, we designed a pseudo-confidence obtainable from the shortest path distance of each channel feature on a node. Using the pseudo-confidence, we developed a new framework for missing feature imputation that consists of channel-wise internode diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation. As validated in experiments, the proposed method demonstrates outperforming performance on both node classification and link prediction. The channel-wise confidence approach for missing feature imputation can be straightforwardly applied to various graph-related downstream tasks with missing node features.

# ETHICS STATEMENT

The intentionally removed private or confidential information can be recovered using the proposed method and the recovered information can be misused. Therefore, the work is suggested to be used for positive impacts on society in areas such as health care (Wang et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020), crime prediction (Wang et al., 2021), and weather forecasting (Han et al., 2022).

# REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

For theoretical results, we explained the assumptions and the complete proofs of all theoretical results in Section 3.4, 3.5, and Appendix. In addition, we include the data and implementation details to reproduce the experimental results in Section 4 and Appendix A.3. We will release our code.
