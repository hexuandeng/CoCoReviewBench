# ABSTRACT

Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) are finding increasingly widespread use in many application domains. Despite outstanding progress, quantitative evaluation of such models often involves multiple distinct metrics to assess different desirable properties, such as image quality, conditional consistency, and intra-conditioning diversity. In this setting, model benchmarking becomes a challenge, as each metric may indicate a different "best" model. In this paper, we propose the Fréchet Joint Distance (FJD), which is defined as the Fréchet distance between joint distributions of images and conditioning, allowing it to implicitly capture the aforementioned properties in a single metric. We conduct proof-of-concept experiments on a controllable synthetic dataset, which consistently highlight the benefits of FJD when compared to currently established metrics. Moreover, we use the newly introduced metric to compare existing cGAN-based models for a variety of conditioning modalities (e.g. class labels, object masks, bounding boxes, images, and text captions). We show that FJD can be used as a promising single metric for model benchmarking.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The use of generative models is growing across many domains (van den Oord et al., 2016c; Vondrick et al., 2016; Serban et al., 2017; Karras et al., 2018; Brock et al., 2019). Among the most promising approaches, Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014), auto-regressive models (van den Oord et al., 2016a;b), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) have been driving significant progress, with the latter at the forefront of a wide-range of applications (Mirza & Osindero, 2014; Reed et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018a; Vondrick et al., 2016; Almahairi et al., 2018; Subramanian et al., 2018; Salvador et al., 2019). In particular, significant research has emerged from practical applications, which require generation to be based on existing context. For example, tasks such as image inpainting, super-resolution, or text-to-image synthesis have been successfully addressed within the framework of conditional generation, with conditional GANs (cGANs) among the most competitive approaches. Despite these outstanding advances, quantitative evaluation of GANs remains a challenge (Theis et al., 2016; Borji, 2018).

In the last few years, a significant number of evaluation metrics for GANs have been introduced in the literature (Salimans et al., 2016; Heusel et al., 2017; Binkowski et al., 2018; Shmelkov et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019; Kynkänniemi et al., 2019; Ravuri & Vinyals, 2019). Although there is no clear consensus on which quantitative metric is most appropriate to benchmark GAN-based models, Inception Score (IS) (Salimans et al., 2016) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017) have been extensively used. However, both IS and FID were introduced in the context of unconditional image generation and, hence, focus on capturing certain desirable properties such as visual quality and sample diversity, which do not fully encapsulate all the different phenomena that arise during conditional image generation.

In conditional generation, we care about visual quality, conditional consistency – i.e., verifying that the generation respects its conditioning, and intra-conditioning diversity – i.e., sample diversity per conditioning. Although visual quality is captured by both metrics, IS is agnostic to intra-conditioning diversity and FID only captures it indirectly.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, neither of them can capture conditional con-

sistency. In order to overcome these shortcomings, researchers have resorted to reporting conditional consistency and diversity metrics in conjunction with FID (Zhao et al., 2019; Park et al., 2019).

Consistency metrics often use some form of concept detector to ensure that the requested conditioning appears in the generated image as expected. Although intuitive to use, these metrics require pretrained models that cover the same target concepts in the same format as the conditioning (i.e., classifiers for image-level class conditioning, semantic segmentation for mask conditioning, etc.), which may or may not be available off-the-shelf. Moreover, using different metrics to evaluate different desirable properties may hinder the process of model selection, as there may not be a single model that surpasses the rest in all measures. In fact, it has recently been demonstrated that there is a natural trade-off between image quality and sample diversity (Yang et al., 2019), which calls into question how we might select the correct balance of these properties.

In this paper we introduce a new metric called Fréchet Joint Distance (FJD), which is able to implicitly assess image quality, conditional consistency, and intra-conditioning diversity. FJD computes the Fréchet distance on an embedding of the joint image-conditioning distribution, and introduces only small computational overhead over FID compared to alternative methods. We evaluate the properties of FJD on a variant of the synthetic dSprite dataset (Matthey et al., 2017) and verify that it successfully captures the desired properties. We provide an analysis on the behavior of both FID and FJD under different types of conditioning such as class labels, bounding boxes, and object masks, and evaluate a variety of existing cGAN models for real-world datasets with the newly introduced metric. Our experiments show that (1) FJD captures the three highlighted properties of conditional generation; (2) it can be applied to any kind of conditioning (e.g., class, bounding box, mask, image, text, etc.); and (3) when applied to existing cGAN-based models, FJD demonstrates its potential to be used as a promising unified metric for cGAN benchmarking. To our knowledge, there are no existing metrics for conditional generation that capture all of these key properties.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Conditional GANs have witnessed outstanding progress in recent years. Training stability has been improved through the introduction of techniques such as progressive growing, Karras et al. (2018), spectral normalization (Miyato et al., 2018) and the two time-scale update rule (Heusel et al., 2017). Architecturally, conditional generation has been improved through the use of auxiliary classifiers (Odena et al., 2017) and the introduction of projection-based conditioning for the discriminator (Miyato & Koyama, 2018). Image quality has also benefited from the incorporation of self-attention (Zhang et al., 2018a), as well as increases in model capacity and batch size (Brock et al., 2019).

All of this progress has led to impressive results, paving the road towards the challenging task of generating more complex scenes. To this end, a flurry of works have tackled different forms of conditional image generation, including class-based (Mirza & Osindero, 2014; Heusel et al., 2017; Miyato et al., 2018; Odena et al., 2017; Miyato & Koyama, 2018; Brock et al., 2019), image-based (Isola et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2017b; Almahairi et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018; Mao et al., 2019), mask- and bounding box-based (Hong et al., 2018; Hinz et al., 2019; Park et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019), as well as text- (Reed et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; 2018a; Xu et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2018) and dialogue-based conditionings (Sharma et al., 2018; El-Nouby et al., 2019). This intensified research has lead to the development of a variety of metrics to assess the three factors of conditional image generation process quality, namely: visual quality, conditional consistency, and intra-conditioning diversity.

Visual quality. A number of GAN evaluation metrics have emerged in the literature to assess visual quality of generated images in the case of unconditional image generation. Most of these metrics either focus on the separability between generated images and real images (Lehmann & Romano, 2005; Radford et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Isola et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2019), compute the distance between distributions (Gretton et al., 2012; Heusel et al., 2017; Arjovsky et al., 2017), assess sample quality and diversity from conditional or marginal distributions (Salimans et al., 2016; Gurumurthy et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018), measure the similarity between generated and real images (Wang et al., 2004; Xiang & Li, 2017; Snell et al., 2017; Juefei-Xu et al., 2017) or are log-likelihood based (Theis et al., 2016) $^{2}$ . Among these, the most accepted automated visual quality metrics are

Inception Score (IS) (Salimans et al., 2016) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017).

Conditional consistency. To assess the consistency of the generated images with respect to model conditioning, researchers have reverted to available, pre-trained feed-forward models. The structure of these models depends on the modality of the conditioning (e.g. segmentation models are used for mask conditioning or image captioning models are applied to evaluate text conditioning). Moreover, the metric used to evaluate the forward model on the generated distribution depends on the conditioning modality and includes: accuracy in the case of class-conditioned generation, Intersection over Union when using bounding box- and mask-conditionings, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005) or CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015) in the case of text-based conditionings, and Structural Similarity (SSIM) or peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for image-conditioning.

Intra-conditioning diversity. The most common metric for evaluating sample diversity is Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) (Zhang et al., 2018b), which measures the distance between samples in a learned feature space. Alternatively, (Miyato & Koyama, 2018) proposed Intra-FID, which calculates a FID score separately for each conditioning and reports the average score over all conditionings. This method should in principle capture the desirable properties of image quality, conditional consistency, and intra-class diversity. However, it scales poorly with the number of unique conditions, as the computationally intensive FID calculation must be repeated for each case, and because FID behaves poorly when the sample size is small (Binkowski et al., 2018). Furthermore, in cases where the conditioning cannot be broken down into a set of discrete classes (e.g., pixel-based conditioning), Intra-FID is intractable. As a result, it has not been applied beyond class-conditioning.

# 3 REVIEW OF FRECHET INCEPTION DISTANCE (FID)

FID aims to compare the statistics of generated samples to samples from a real dataset. Given two multivariate Gaussian distributions  $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$  and  $\mathcal{N}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}, \hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}})$ , Fréchet Distance (FD) is defined as:

$$
d ^ {2} \left((\boldsymbol {\mu}, \boldsymbol {\Sigma}), (\hat {\boldsymbol {\mu}}, \hat {\boldsymbol {\Sigma}})\right) = | | \boldsymbol {\mu} - \hat {\boldsymbol {\mu}} | | _ {2} ^ {2} + T r \left(\boldsymbol {\Sigma} + \hat {\boldsymbol {\Sigma}} - 2 (\boldsymbol {\Sigma} \hat {\boldsymbol {\Sigma}}) ^ {1 / 2}\right). \tag {1}
$$

When evaluating a generative model,  $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu},\boldsymbol{\Sigma})$  represents the data (reference) distribution, obtained by fitting a Gaussian to samples from a reference dataset, and  $\mathcal{N}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}},\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}})$  represents the learned (generated) distribution, a result of fitting to samples from a generative model.

In FID, both the real images and model samples are embedded in a learned feature space using a pre-trained Inception v3 model (Szegedy et al., 2016). Thus, the Gaussian distributions are defined in the embedded space. More precisely, given a dataset of images  $\{\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\}_{i = 0}^{N}$ , a set of model samples  $\{\hat{\mathbf{x}}^{(i)}\}_{i = 0}^{M}$ , and an Inception embedding function  $f$ , we estimate the Gaussian parameters  $\mu$ ,  $\Sigma$ ,  $\hat{\mu}$  and  $\tilde{\Sigma}$  as:

$$
\boldsymbol {\mu} = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {N} f \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(i)}\right), \quad \boldsymbol {\Sigma} = \frac {1}{N - 1} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {N} \left(f \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(i)}\right) - \boldsymbol {\mu}\right) \left(f \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(i)}\right) - \boldsymbol {\mu}\right) ^ {T}, \tag {2}
$$

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {\mu}} = \frac {1}{M} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {M} f \left(\hat {\mathbf {x}} ^ {(i)}\right), \quad \hat {\boldsymbol {\Sigma}} = \frac {1}{M - 1} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {M} \left(f \left(\hat {\mathbf {x}} ^ {(i)}\right) - \hat {\boldsymbol {\mu}}\right) \left(f \left(\hat {\mathbf {x}} ^ {(i)}\right) - \hat {\boldsymbol {\mu}}\right) ^ {T}. \tag {3}
$$

# 4 FRÉCHET JOINT DISTANCE (FJD)

In conditional image generation, a dataset is composed of image-condition pairs  $\{(\mathbf{x}^{(i)},\mathbf{y}^{(i)})\}_{i = 0}^{N}$  where the conditioning can take variable forms, such as image-level classes, segmentation masks, or text. The goal of conditional image generation is to produce realistic looking, diverse images  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$  that are consistent with the conditioning  $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ . Thus, a set of model samples with corresponding conditioning can be defined as:  $\{(\hat{\mathbf{x}}^{(i)},\hat{\mathbf{y}}^{(i)})\}_{i = 0}^{M}$ .

As discussed in Section 3, the Fréchet distance (FD) compares any two Gaussians defined over arbitrary spaces. In FJD, we propose to compute the FD between two Gaussians defined over the joint image-conditioning embedding space.

More precisely, given an image embedding function  $f$ , a conditioning embedding function  $h$ , a conditioning embedding scaling factor  $\alpha$ , and a merging function  $g$  that combines the image embedding with the conditioning embedding into a joint one, we can estimate the respective Gaussian parameters  $\mu, \Sigma, \hat{\mu}$  and  $\hat{\Sigma}$  as:

$$
\boldsymbol {\mu} = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {N} g \left(f \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(i)}\right), \alpha h \left(\mathbf {y} ^ {(i)}\right)\right), \quad \hat {\boldsymbol {\mu}} = \frac {1}{M} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {M} g \left(f \left(\hat {\mathbf {x}} ^ {(i)}\right), \alpha h \left(\hat {\mathbf {y}} ^ {(i)}\right)\right), \tag {4}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {\Sigma} = \frac {1}{N - 1} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {N} \left(g \left(f \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(i)}\right), \alpha h \left(\mathbf {y} ^ {(i)}\right)\right) - \boldsymbol {\mu}\right) \left(g \left(f \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(i)}\right), \alpha h \left(\mathbf {y} ^ {(i)}\right)\right) - \boldsymbol {\mu}\right) ^ {T}, \tag {5}
$$

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {\Sigma}} = \frac {1}{M - 1} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {M} \left(g \left(f \left(\hat {\mathbf {x}} ^ {(i)}\right), \alpha h \left(\hat {\mathbf {y}} ^ {(i)}\right)\right) - \hat {\boldsymbol {\mu}}\right) \left(g \left(f \left(\hat {\mathbf {x}} ^ {(i)}\right), \alpha h \left(\hat {\mathbf {y}} ^ {(i)}\right)\right) - \hat {\boldsymbol {\mu}}\right) ^ {T}. \tag {6}
$$

Note that by computing the FD over the joint image-conditioning distribution, we are able to simultaneously assess image quality, conditional consistency, and intra-conditioning diversity, all of which are important factors in evaluating the quality of conditional image generation models.

To ensure reproducibility, when reporting FJD scores it is important to include details such as which conditioning embedding function was used, which dataset is used for the reference distribution, and the  $\alpha$  value. We report these values for all of our experiments in Appendix B.

# 4.1 CONDITIONING EMBEDDING FUNCTION:  $h$

The purpose of the embedding function  $h$  is to reduce the dimensionality and extract a useful feature representation of the conditioning. As such, the choice of  $h$  will vary depending on the modality of conditioning. In most cases, an off-the-shelf, pretrained embedding can be used for the purposes of extracting a useful representation. In the absence of preexisting, pretrained conditioning

embedding functions, a new one should be learned. For example, for bounding box and mask conditionings the embedding function could be learned with an autoencoder. For suggested assignments of conditioning modalities to embedding functions please refer to Table 1.

# 4.2 CONDITIONING EMBEDDING SCALING FACTOR:  $\alpha$

In order to control the relative contribution of the image component and the conditioning component to the final FJD value, we scale the conditioning embedding by a constant  $\alpha$ . In essence,  $\alpha$  indicates how much we care about the conditioning component compared to the image component. When  $\alpha = 0$ , the conditioning component is ignored and FJD is equivalent to FID. As the value of  $\alpha$  increases, the perceived importance of the conditioning component is also increased and reflected accordingly in the resulting measure. To equally weight the image component and the conditioning component, we recommend setting  $\alpha$  to be equal to the ratio between the average  $L_{2}$  norm of the image embedding and the conditioning embedding. This weighting ensures that FJD retains consistent behaviour across conditioning embeddings, even with varying dimensionality or magnitude. We note that  $\alpha$  should be calculated on data from the reference distribution (real data distribution), and then applied to all conditioning embeddings thereafter. See Appendix F for an example of the effect of the  $\alpha$  hyperparameter.

# 4.3 MERGING FUNCTION:  $g$

The purpose of the merging function  $g$  is to combine the image embedding and conditioning embedding into a single joint embedding. We compared several candidate merging functions and found concatenation of the image embedding and conditioning embedding vectors to be most effective, both in terms of simplicity and performance. As such, concatenation is used as the merging function in all following experiments.

# 5 EVALUATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF FRECHET JOINT DISTANCE

In this section, we demonstrate that FJD captures the three desiderata of conditional image generation, namely image quality, conditional consistency and intra-conditioning diversity.

# 5.1 DATASET

dSprite-textures. The dSprite dataset (Matthey et al., 2017) is a synthetic dataset where each image depicts a simple 2D shape on a black background. Each image can be fully described by a set of factors, including shape, scale, rotation,  $x$  position, and  $y$  position. We augment the dSprite dataset to create dSprite-textures by adding three texture patterns for each sample. Additionally, we include class labels indicating shape, as well as bounding boxes and mask labels for each sample (see Figure 1). In total, the dataset contains 2,211,840 unique images. This synthetic dataset allows us to exactly control our sample distribution and, thereby, simulate a generator with image-conditioning inconsistencies or reduced sample diversity. To embed the conditioning for calculating FJD in the following experiments, we use one-hot encoding for the class labels, and autoencoder representations for the bounding box and mask labels. We are releasing the code to generate dSprite-textures.

# 5.2 IMAGE QUALITY

In this subsection, we aim to test the sensitivity of FJD to image quality perturbations. To do so, we draw 10k random samples from the dSprite-textures dataset to form a reference dataset. The generated dataset is simulated by duplicating the reference dataset and adding Gaussian noise drawn from  $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$  to the images, where  $\sigma \in [0,0.25]$  and pixel values are normalized (and clipped after noise addition) to the range [0, 1]. The addition of noise mimics a generative model that produces low quality images. We repeat this experiment for all three conditioning types in dSprite-textures: class, bounding box, and mask.

Results are shown in Figure 2, where we plot both FID and FJD as a function of the added Gaussian noise ( $\sigma$  is indicated on the  $x$ -axis as Noise Magnitude). We find that, in all cases, FJD tracks FID very closely, indicating that it successfully captures image quality. Interestingly, we note that FJD increases slightly compared to FID as image

quality decreases, likely due to a decrease in perceived conditional consistency. Additional image quality experiments on the large scale COCO-Stuff dataset can be found in Appendix C.

# 5.3 CONDITIONAL CONSISTENCY

In this subsection, we aim to highlight the sensitivity of FJD to conditional consistency. In particular, we target specific types of inconsistencies, such as incorrect scale, orientation, or position. We draw a set of 10k samples from the dSprite-textures dataset and duplicate it to represent the reference dataset and the generated dataset, each with identical image and conditioning marginal distributions. For  $30\%$  of the generated dataset samples we swap conditionings of pairs of samples that are identical in all but one of the attributes (scale, orientation,  $x$  position or  $y$  position). For example, if one generated sample has attribute  $x$  position 4 and a second generated sample has attribute  $x$  position 7, swapping their conditionings leads to generated samples that are offset by 3 pixels w.r.t. their ground truth  $x$  position. Swapping conditionings in this manner allows us to control for specific attributes' conditional consistency, while keeping the image and conditioning marginal distributions unchanged. As a result, all changes in FJD can be attributed solely to conditional inconsistencies.

Figure 3 depicts the results of this experiment for four different types of alterations: scale, orientation, and  $x$  and  $y$  positions. We observe that the FID between image distributions (solid blue line) remains constant even as the degree of conditional inconsistency increases. For class conditioning (dotted orange line), FJD also remains constant, as changes to scale, orientation, and position are independent of the object class. Bounding box and mask conditionings, as they contain spatial information, produce variations in FJD that are proportional to the offset. Interestingly, for the orientation offsets, FJD with mask conditioning fluctuates rather than increasing monotonically. This behaviour is due to the orientation masks partially re-aligning with the ground truth around  $90^{\circ}$  and  $180^{\circ}$ . Each of these cases emphasize the effective sensitivity of FJD with respect to conditional consistency. Additional conditional consistency experiments with text conditioning can be found in Appendix D.

# 5.4 INTRA-CONDITIONING DIVERSITY

In this subsection, we aim to test the sensitivity of FJD to intra-conditioning diversity<sup>5</sup>, by alternating the per-conditioning image texture variability. More precisely, we vary the texture based on four different image attributes: shape that is captured in all tested conditionings, as well as scale, orientation and position that are captured by bounding box and mask conditionings only. To create attribute-texture assignments, we stratify attributes based on their values. For example, one possible shape-based stratification of a dataset with three shapes might be: [squares, ellipses, hearts]. To quantify the dataset intra-conditioning diversity, we introduce a diversity score. A diversity score of 1 means that the per-attribute texture distribution is uniform across stratas, while a diversity score of 0 means that each strata is assigned to a single texture. Middling diversity scores indicate that the textural distribution is skewed towards one texture type in each strata. We create our reference dataset by randomly drawing 10k samples. The generated distribution is created by duplicating the reference distribution and adjusting the per-attribute texture variability to achieve the desired diversity score.

The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 4, which plots the increase in FID and FJD, for different types of conditioning, as the diversity of textures within each subset decreases. Not surprisingly, since a change in the joint distribution of attributes and textures also implies a change to the image marginal distribution, we observe that FID increases with reduced diversity. However, the increase in FJD is larger than the increase in FID, suggesting that FJD is more sensitive to changes

in intra-conditioning diversity than FID. It is interesting to note that FJD only increases over FID when the conditioning captures information related to the attribute that is losing internal diversity. For example, when altering shape-based texture diversity, FJD for all conditioning types increases over FID, as they all contain class information about the shape (see first panel in Figure 4). However, in cases where the attribute responsible for texture reduction is not captured in the conditioning, such as in the case of scale, orientation, or position, FJD of class conditioning is similar in magnitude to FID (remaining panels in Figure 4).

# 6 EVALUATION OF EXISTING CONDITIONAL GENERATION MODELS

In this section, we seek to evaluate existing cGAN-based models in terms of FJD, and to contrast these results to the ones provided by FID, as well as standard conditional consistency and diversity metrics. In particular, we focus on testing class-conditioned, image-conditioned, and text-conditioned image generation tasks, which have been the focus of numerous works<sup>6</sup>. Multi-label, bounding box, and mask conditioning are also explored in Appendix H. In all following experiments we use LPIPS to measure intra-conditioning diversity.

# Class-conditioned cGANs. Table

Specifically, we evaluate SN-GAN (Miyato et al., 2018) trained with and without a projection discriminator (Miyato & Koyama, 2018), and BigGAN (Brock et al., 2019). Accuracy is used to evaluate conditional consistency, and is com

puted as the Inception v3 accuracy of each model's generated samples, using their conditioning as classification ground truth. Class labels from the validation set are used as conditioning to generate 50k samples for each model, and the training set is used as the reference distribution. One-hot encoding is used to embed the class conditioning for the purposes of calculating FJD.

We find that FJD follows the same trend as FID for class-conditioned models, preserving their ranking and highlighting the FJD's ability to capture image quality. Additionally, we note that the difference between FJD and FID correlates with each model's classification accuracy, with smaller gaps appearing to indicate better conditional consistency. Diversity scores, however, rank models in the opposite order compared to all other metrics.

This behaviour evokes the trade-off between realism and diversity highlighted by Yang et al. (2019). Ideally, we would like a model that produces diverse outputs, but this property is not as attractive if it also results in a decrease in image quality. At what point should diversity be prioritized over image quality, and vice versa? FJD is a suitable metric for answering this question if the goal is to find a model that best matches the target conditional data generating distribution. We refer the reader to Appendix F for examples of cases where models with greater diversity are favoured over models with better image quality.

Image-conditioned cGANs. Table 3 compares four state-of-the-art image translation models: Pix2pix (Isola et al., 2017), BicycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017b), MSGAN (Mao et al., 2019), and MUNIT (Huang et al., 2018). We evaluate on four different image-to-image datasets: Facades (Tylecek & Šára, 2013), Maps (Isola et al., 2017), Edges2Shoes and Edges2Handbag (Zhu et al., 2016). To assess conditional consistency we utilize LPIPS to measure the average distance between generated images and their corresponding ground truth images. Conditioning from the validation sets are used to generate images, while the training sets are used as reference distributions. An Inceptionv3 model is used to embed the image conditioning for the FJD calculation. Due to the small size of the validation sets, we report scores averaged over 5 evaluations of each model.

In this setting we encounter some ambiguity with regards to model selection, as for all datasets, each metric ranks the models differently. BicycleGAN appears to have the best image quality, Pix2pix produces images that are most visually similar to the ground truth, and MSGAN and MUNIT achieve the best sample diversity scores. This scenario demonstrates the benefits of using a single unified metric for model selection, for which there is only a single best model.

Text-conditioned cGANs. Table 4 shows FJD and FID scores for three state-of-the-art text-conditioned models trained on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset (CUB-200) (Welinder et al., 2010) at  $256 \times 256$  resolution: HDGan (Zhang et al., 2018c), StackGAN++ (Zhang et al., 2018a), and AttnGAN (Xu et al., 2018). Conditional consistency is evaluated us

ing visual-semantic similarity, as proposed by Zhang et al. (2018c). Conditioning from the test set captions is used to generate 30k images, and the same test set is also used as the reference distribution. We use pre-computed Char-CNN-RNN sentence embeddings as the conditioning embedding for FJD, since they are commonly used with CUB-200 and are readily available.

In this case we find that AttnGAN dominates in terms of conditional consistency compared to HDGan and StackGAN++, while all models are comparable in terms of diversity. AttnGAN is ranked best overall by FJD. In cases where the biggest differentiator between the models is image quality, FID and FJD will provide a consistent ranking as we see here. But in cases where the trade-off is more subtle we believe practitioners will opt for a metric that measurably captures intra-conditioning diversity.

# 7 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we introduce Fréchet Joint Distance (FJD), which is able to assess image quality, conditional consistency, and intra-conditioning diversity within a single metric. We compare FJD to FID on the synthetic dSprite-textures dataset, validating its ability to capture the three properties of interest across different types of conditioning, and highlighting its potential to be adopted as unified cGAN benchmarking metric. We also demonstrate how FJD can be used to address the potentially ambiguous trade-off between image quality and sample diversity when performing model selection. Looking forward, FJD could serve as valuable metric to ground future research, as it has the potential to help elucidate the most promising contributions within the scope of conditional generation.
