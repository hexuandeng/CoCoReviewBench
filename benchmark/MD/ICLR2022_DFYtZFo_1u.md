# ABSTRACT

Machine learning is faced with many data challenges when applied in practice. Among them, a notable barrier is that data are distributed and sharing is unrealistic for volume and privacy reasons. Federated learning is a recent formalism to tackle this challenge, so that data owners can develop a common model jointly but use it separately. In this work, we consider a less addressed scenario where a datum consists of multiple parts, each of which belongs to a separate owner. In this scenario, joint efforts are required not only in learning but also in inference. We study federated inference, which allows each data owner to learn its own model that captures local data characteristics and copes with data heterogeneity. On the top is a federation of the local data representations, performing global inference that incorporates all distributed parts collectively. To enhance this local-global framework, we propose aligning the ambiguous data representations caused by arbitrary arrangement of neurons in local neural network models, as well as learning a consensus graph among data owners in the global model to improve performance. We demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed framework on four real-life data sets including power grid systems and traffic networks.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Machine learning models become increasingly data hungry as the promise of deep learning continues to realize. More and more applications grow in scale thanks to the availability of distributed data across devices and organizations. Federated learning (McMahan et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Kairouz et al., 2019) emerges as a formalism that allows data owners to collaboratively train a common model by using one's own data without sharing. Such a formalism is poised to resolve the challenges of expensive data communication and the risk of privacy violation, in light of policies such as the General Data Protection Regulation (Albrecht, 2016).

An issue less addressed by federated learning is the inference process. In fact, inference therein is trivial: once the common model is learned, each data owner retains a copy and applies it on local data, independently of other owners. However, such a scenario is not the only one how data are distributed in practice. In this work, we consider the following scenario: a datum has multiple parts, each of which belongs to a separate owner. Then, the inference must be collectively performed by all participating owners, since none of them alone possesses the entire information.

Vertical federated learning studies such a scenario (Hardy et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020). This concept is figuratively named through cutting the data matrix vertically along the feature axis, rather than the data axis. From the sporadic literature addressing in this scenario, methods generally introduce model parameters distributed with data parts and optionally global parameters that reside in a central server. All parameters are learned jointly, causing however a practical drawback—expensive coordination (even synchronization) is required among data owners and the central server (if present).

Consider a live example—the national electricity grid, over which thousands of phasor measurement units (PMUs) have been deployed to monitor the grid condition (Smartgrid.gov). PMU measurements, as time series data, are owned by several parties. These data may be used to train machine learning models that identify grid events (e.g., fault, oscillation, and generator trip). Such an event

detection system relies on collective series measurements at the same time window but distributed across different data owners. To minimize coordination among owners and maximize autonomy, it is more desirable if each maintains a model of their own and does not participate joint training.

In this work, we propose a local-global model framework that maintains data owner autonomy while staying effective in global inference. Therein, each data owner trains a local model with its data part; the training is independent and incurs no coordination. In the deep learning terminology, the local models produce data representations for input data. Then, a central server takes these representations as input and trains a model for global inference.

We term the scenario where inference is collectively performed by data owners but training incurs little coordination among them, federated inference, to distinguish federated learning and vertical federated learning. The local-global framework we propose for this scenario, however, bears two technical challenges. One is the ambiguity of local data representations, because feature dimensions can be arbitrarily permuted without changing the local model. Another challenge is how the global model leverages innate interactions of local data missed by independent local models.

We resolve the first challenge through aligning the feature dimensions across all local representations. We resolve the second challenge through employing graph neural networks as the global inference model, where the graph corresponds to the explicit or implicit relational structure of the data owners. When such a graph is not present, we treat the combinatorial graph structure as a random variable of the Bernoulli distribution and optimize the distribution parameters as well.

We summarize the contributions of this work as follows.

1. We formalized federated inference, a less addressed scenario of machine learning with distributed data, where inference is conducted jointly by data owners without data sharing and coordinated training (Section 2).  
2. We propose an inference framework that consists of autonomous local models and a central model that digests local data representations and produces a global output (Section 3).  
3. We address the ambiguity challenge of this framework through aligning local representations (Section 4) and address the missing of local model interactions through employing a graph neural network in the central global model. We further propose to simultaneously learn the graph structure if not present (Section 5).  
4. We study approaches to latent alignment and approaches to graph structure learning and develop theoretical insights into these approaches (Theorems 1-3). As a byproduct, a more efficient Bernoulli sampling method icdf is proposed to sample graphs for structure learning.  
5. We demonstrate experiments with four real-life data sets including power grids and traffic networks and show the effectiveness of the proposed framework (Section 6).

# 2 PROBLEM SETTING

Federated inference refers to a machine learning scenario where both training and inference are conducted on distributed data collectively by data owners. Each owner enjoys data and model autonomy but is subject to centralized coordination that produces a global prediction. This scenario stands in contrast to federated learning, whose inference process is local and separate among owners.

Formally, we use a superscript  $i$  to index data owners. Let  $x$  be a datum with label  $y$  and let  $x^i$  be the part of datum the  $i$ th owner possesses; that is,  $x = (x^{1}, x^{2}, \ldots, x^{n})$  with  $n$  owners. The problem is to learn a model

$$
y = f (x) = f \left(x ^ {1}, x ^ {2}, \dots , x ^ {n}\right) \tag {1}
$$

collectively with all data parts and to perform inference jointly by all owners. Additionally, owners share neither data nor models with each other for, e.g., privacy reasons. Moreover, owners do not participate joint training, which often incurs expensive coordination.

Similarity to federated learning. Federated inference shares the defining data characteristics of federated learning, first coined in McMahan et al. (2017): distributed, non-IID, and unbalanced. Data are distributed among owners but not shared. In fact, data may even be heterogeneous. For example, time series measures of the power grid may have different attribute dimensions and may be under different sampling frequencies. As a result, data size may vary significantly among owners.

Dissimilarity to federated learning. The root of the differences between these two concepts is the constituent of one datum (data point). In federated learning, a data point is the basic unit of data and thus all owners learn a common model but use it separately. On the other hand, federated inference is concerned with data split in parts across owners. All parts of a data point contribute to the inference collectively.

Similarity and dissimilarity to vertical federated learning. Both concepts are concerned with the split of a datum across owners. However, approaches taken for vertical federated learning differ substantially from ours because of joint training among owners. From the less prolific literature, two lines of work are noted. One takes the data matrix literally, by assuming tabular data and studying linear models, where model parameters have natural correspondence to the data parts (Hardy et al., 2017; Nock et al., 2018; Heinze et al., 2014; 2016). Often, these approaches are hard to generalize to complex data and/or many owners. Another line of work uses a local-global model framework similarly as we do but jointly trains these two parts, incurring expensive communication and creating dependence of local models (Hu et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020). In contrast, we allow data owners to train their models independently, maintaining local model autonomy.

Data example. Let us consider the power grid. Figure 1 pictorially illustrates PMU measurements distributed across data owners. A panel of time series corresponds to a specific time window and the series collectively represent one data point, which the event detection system classifies. In this simplified illustration, each data owner possesses one series recorded by one PMU; but in practice they may own different amounts of PMUs (and thus series). Moreover, the series may differ in length because of varying sampling frequencies; and the series are multivariate with possibly different number of variates. All these variations contribute to data heterogeneity, which necessitates the construction of separate local models. Note that if an event does not cascade over the entire grid, some local models may report event whereas others report normal, resulting in conflicting opinions. A consensus (global) model is responsible for resolving the conflict. Additionally, missing data may occur.

Figure 1: Federated inference: A global label is predicted collectively based on local data from multiple owners. Local data may be heterogeneous and missing data may occur.

# 3 FEDERATED INFERENCE FRAMEWORK

As such, the proposed framework for federated inference consists of local models  $f^i$  and a global model  $g$ , such that their composition is the sought  $f$  denoted in (1). Each data owner  $i$  possesses a local model trained with its data, independently of other owners. This way, no data sharing is invoked and privacy is of minimal concern. However, because the local models lack a global vision and may be conflicting, a central (global) model is key to coordinating the local opinions for final prediction. To maintain autonomy, local models are frozen once pretrained and will not join the training of the global model. Data owners send local data representations to a centralized server for global model training (and inference). In other words, the global model queries neither the raw data nor the local models from data owners. As long as owners agree to send the less decipherable representations to the central server, global inference can be made.

Local models. We treat a neural network except the final output layer as a feature extractor, which produces the representation  $h^i$  of an input  $x^i$ ; and treat for simplicity the output layer as a logistic regression. That is, a local model  $f^i$  reads:

$$
f ^ {i} \left(x ^ {i}\right) = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(W ^ {i} h ^ {i} + b ^ {i}\right) \quad \text {w h e r e} \quad h ^ {i} = \operatorname {e m b e d d i n g} \left(x ^ {i}\right). \tag {2}
$$

Figure 2: Federated inference framework. Local models are trained independently and separately from the global model. The algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1 in supplement Section C.

We interchangeably use "representation", "embedding", and "latent vector" to mean  $h^i$ . These  $h^i$ 's are assumed to have the same shape across  $i$ , although  $x^i$  can have different shapes and the embedding function can have different architectures to cope with data heterogeneity. A simple example of the embedding function is a fully connected layer  $h^i = \mathrm{ReLU}(U^i x^i + c^i)$ ; but an arbitrarily complex function is applicable.

Global model. The global model is a function  $g$  of all local representations:

$$
\widehat {y} = g \left(h ^ {1}, h ^ {2}, \dots , h ^ {n}\right). \tag {3}
$$

An example of  $g$  is a fully connected layer, followed by mean pooling and another fully connected layer:

$$
\widehat {y} = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(W _ {1} \cdot \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \operatorname {R e L U} \left(W _ {0} h ^ {i} + b _ {0}\right) + b _ {1}\right). \tag {4}
$$

Challenges. Two considerations are pertinent to this framework. First, when the latent dimensions have semantic meaning (e.g., when the local models are trained to yield disentangled representations (Higgins et al., 2018)), each latent feature of the local representations may not match, because an arbitrary permutation of the latent dimensions does not change a local model. Second, a naive mean pooling as in (4) may miss the interdependencies between local data, leading to a less well performing global model. Such interdependencies naturally occur in the power grid example because of the physics of an electricity network. Hence, in subsequent sections, we use latent alignment to address the first problem and graph neural network to address the second one. Incorporating these two components, we show the full, proposed framework in Figure 2 and Algorithm 1 (supplement Section C).

# 4 ALIGNING LOCAL REPRESENTATIONS

For the global model to be meaningful, the feature dimensions of the local representations  $h^i$  should match. For example, in (4), all  $h^i$ 's multiply the same weight matrix  $W_0$ ; in other words, each element of  $h^i$  corresponds to one input neuron of the initial fully connected layer. Permutations of the elements will destroy the correspondence. That is, even if the local models are fixed, the arbitrary arrangement of the feature dimensions of the latent vectors causes ambiguity of what an optimal global model can be built.

Mathematically, let us use a vector  $\mathfrak{p}$  to denote permutation and place a superscript  $i$  whenever necessary. The  $i$ th local model (2) can be equivalently written as

$$
f ^ {i} \left(x ^ {i}\right) = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(W ^ {i} [:, \mathrm {p} ^ {i} ] h ^ {i} [ \mathrm {p} ^ {i} ] + b ^ {i}\right) \quad \text {w h e r e} \quad h ^ {i} [ \mathrm {p} ^ {i} ] = \operatorname {e m b e d d i n g} \left(x ^ {i}; \mathrm {p} ^ {i}\right), \tag {5}
$$

for any permutation  $\mathfrak{p}^i$ , as long as the embedding function is able to produce a permuted  $h^i[\mathfrak{p}^i]$  under the same input  $x^i$ . Such a requirement can be easily satisfied if the embedding function is a fully connected layer (i.e.,  $h[\mathfrak{p}] = \mathrm{ReLU}(W[\mathfrak{p},:]x + b[\mathfrak{p}])$ ). In fact, it is satisfied by most neural networks as well. In the supplement, we give another example: the GRU (Cho et al., 2014).

Hence, we propose to align the feature dimensions across all local vectors  $h^i$  to disambiguate the ambiguity. This proposal amounts to modifying the global model (3) to the following:

$$
\widehat {y} = g \left(P ^ {1} h ^ {1}, P ^ {2} h ^ {2}, \dots , P ^ {n} h ^ {n}\right), \tag {6}
$$

where  $P^i$  is an alignment matrix for each data owner  $i$ .

Two approaches of defining  $P^i$  exist. The first approach is a soft alignment, which treats each  $P^i$  as a free parameter matrix to optimize. It may be square or rectangle, the latter case indicating a change of the number of features.

The second approach is a hard alignment, which treats each  $P^i$  a permutation matrix. Learning permutation matrices is challenging, however, because they correspond to combinatorial structures and are unsuitable for gradient-based training. We follow Mena et al. (2018); Emami & Ranka (2018) and relax  $P^i$  by a doubly stochastic matrix, which can be differentiably parameterized by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm (Sinkhorn & Knopp, 1967). Specifically, starting from a nonnegative square matrix  $K_0$  and column vectors  $r_0 = c_0 = 1$  of matching lengths, define the sequence

$$
c _ {j + 1} = \mathbf {1} \oslash \left(K _ {0} ^ {T} r _ {j}\right) \text {a n d} r _ {j + 1} = \mathbf {1} \oslash \left(K _ {0} c _ {j}\right), \quad \text {f o r} j = 0, 1, \dots \tag {7}
$$

Then, under a mild condition,  $K_{j} \coloneqq \mathrm{diag}(r_{j})K_{0}\mathrm{diag}(c_{j})$  converges to a doubly stochastic matrix. We truncate the sequence at the  $T$ th step and treat  $K_{T}$  as an approximation of  $P^{i}$ .

Despite the invocation by Mena et al. (2018); Emami & Ranka (2018), we obtain the following convergence result of Sinkhorn-Knopp, which reveals no free lunch.

Theorem 1 (informal). Under a condition of  $K_{0}$ , there exists a positive integer  $J$  and a constant  $C_{J}$  such that for all  $j \geq J$ ,

$$
\left\| \left[ \begin{array}{c} K _ {j} ^ {T} \mathbf {1} \\ K _ {j} \mathbf {1} \end{array} \right] - \left[ \begin{array}{c} \mathbf {1} \\ \mathbf {1} \end{array} \right] \right\| \leq C _ {J} (1 + \sigma_ {2} ^ {2}) \sigma_ {2} ^ {2 (j - J)},
$$

where  $\sigma_{2} \leq 1$  is the second largest singular value of the limit of  $K_{j}$ .

For a formal statement and the analysis, see supplement Section D and Theorem 5. The result suggests that for a desirable limit being a permutation matrix, whose  $\sigma_{2} = 1$ , the error  $O(\sigma_2^{2j})$  does not drop. In practice, to expect an approximate permutation matrix,  $\sigma_{2}\approx 1$  and the convergence is exceedingly slow. The practical usefulness of (7) depends on the learned quality of  $K_{0}$ .

The soft and hard alignment approaches have pros and cons. The hard approach maintains the correspondence of each feature dimension of the latent vectors while the soft approach does not. Maintaining the dimension correspondence is an advantage, especially for local models that produce disentangled latent representations (Higgins et al., 2018), because each feature dimension is equipped with a semantic meaning that controls a certain aspect of the data. On the other hand, the soft approach is more straightforward and the hard approach is based on an algorithm that barely converges. In practice, we observe that neither approach decisively outperforms the other in federated inference.

# 5 LEARNING A CONSENSUS GRAPH

The example global model (4) performs a naive averaging for the local representations. Since data owners are often interconnected, a more expressive model exploits their relational interactions to improve inference (Battaglia et al., 2018). To this end, we propose to use a graph neural network (GNN) (Zhang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021) to process the latent representations.

Many GNNs are applicable; we focus on GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017) for its simplicity. Let  $A$  be the graph adjacency matrix and let  $H$  be the matrix of aligned local representations:

$$
H = \left[ \begin{array}{c} - (P ^ {1} h ^ {1}) ^ {T} - \\ \vdots \\ - (P ^ {n} h ^ {n}) ^ {T} - \end{array} \right].
$$

Traditionally, GCN was designed for node classification, but we modify it slightly for our purpose as

$$
\widehat {y} = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\frac {1}{n} \mathbf {1} ^ {T} \widehat {A} \cdot \operatorname {R e L U} \left(\widehat {A} H W _ {0}\right) \cdot W _ {1}\right), \tag {8}
$$

where  $\widehat{A}$  is a normalization of  $A$  (see (Kipf & Welling, 2017) for details) and  $W_{0}$  and  $W_{1}$  are weight matrices. The modification is the inclusion of  $\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{1}^T$  as pooling before output. Modulo this modification, the formula (8) is a standard one used in the literature, with the bias terms omitted. It is interesting to note the equivalence of GCN (8) and the graph-agnostic model (4) when  $\widehat{A}$  is replaced by the identity matrix (omitting bias terms).

In GCN,  $A$  corresponds to the consensus graph among local owners as graph nodes. If such a graph is not present, it is possible to learn one such that (8) still outperforms (4). In this case, we treat  $A$  as a random variable of the matrix Bernoulli distribution, where the success probabilities are free parameters to learn. Formally, the elements  $A_{ij}$  are independent and each follows  $\mathrm{Ber}(\theta_{ij})$ , where  $\theta_{ij}$  denotes the corresponding probability (Kipf et al., 2018; Shang et al., 2021). Then, the global model  $g$  has  $W_0$ ,  $W_1$ , the  $P^i$ 's, as well as  $\theta$ , as parameters. Following Franceschi et al. (2019); Shang et al. (2021), we formulate the training loss as an expectation over  $A$ 's distribution and draws a sample  $A$  to obtain an unbiased estimate of the loss as well as the gradient, in each stochastic optimization step.

The central challenge of this approach is that  $A$  (and hence also the loss) is not differentiable with respect to  $\theta$ . A popular remedy is the Gumbel softmax reparameterization trick (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2017). In what follows, for simplicity of exposition, we treat  $\theta$  a scalar rather than a matrix. The Gumbel trick works in the following manner. Let  $\operatorname{Cat}(\pi)$  be the categorical distribution with probability vector  $\pi$  and let  $g$ , of the same shape as  $\pi$ , be a vector variable whose elements are iid  $\sim$  Gumbel(0,1). Then, the vector random variable

$$
y = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\left(\log \pi + g\right) / \tau\right), \quad \tau > 0 \tag {9}
$$

admits a distribution converging to  $\operatorname{Cat}(\pi)$  when  $\tau \to 0$ . Hence, to sample  $\operatorname{Ber}(\theta)$  approximately but differentiably, it suffices to let  $\pi = [\theta, 1 - \theta]$  and use  $y_{1}$  as the sample.

In order to obtain one Bernoulli sample, the Gumbel trick requires to sample the Gumbel distribution twice. We consider an alternative that samples any appropriate distribution only once.

Definition 1. Let  $F$  be the cdf of an arbitrary continuous probability distribution. Sample  $s$  from this distribution and let

$$
z = \operatorname {s i g m o i d} \left(\left(F ^ {- 1} (\theta) - s\right) / \tau\right), \quad \tau > 0. \tag {10}
$$

We call this method icdf.

The name icdf is owing to the use of  $F^{-1}$ . The reader should not confuse this method with the inverse transform method for sampling a random variable with a particular cdf  $F$ . Here, we use any  $F$  to sample an (approximate) Bernoulli distribution. The following result qualifies  $z$  to be an approximate Bernoulli variable. The proof, as well as those of subsequent theorems, is given in the supplement.

Theorem 2. For all  $\tau >0$ ,  $\theta \in (0,1)$ , and  $t\in [0,1]$ , if the distribution with cdf  $F$  is finitely supported on  $[a,b]$ , then

$$
\Pr (z \leq t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 0 & i f \quad t <   \operatorname {s i g m o i d} \left(\left(F ^ {- 1} (\theta) - b\right) / \tau\right), \\ 1 & i f \quad t > \operatorname {s i g m o i d} \left(\left(F ^ {- 1} (\theta) - a\right) / \tau\right), \\ 1 - F \left(F ^ {- 1} (\theta) + \tau \log \left(t ^ {- 1} - 1\right)\right) & \text {o t h e r w i s e .} \end{array} \right. \tag {11}
$$

On the other hand, if the distribution is not finitely supported (i.e.,  $a = -\infty$  and/or  $b = +\infty$ ), (11) still holds because either, or both, of the first two cases will not be invoked. As a consequence, the distribution of  $z$  converges to  $\operatorname{Ber}(\theta)$  as  $\tau \to 0$ .

It is imperative to understand the rate of convergence of  $y_{1}$  (Gumbel trick) and that of  $z$  (icdf method). While one may take the usual convergence-in-distribution approach, the complex forms of the cdf (e.g., (11)) render the analysis difficult. Instead, we take the convergence-in-mean approach and calculate  $\mathrm{Bias}(x) = \mathbb{E}[x] - \theta$ . We derive the following result.

Theorem 3. When  $\tau$  is small,

$$
\operatorname {B i a s} \left(y _ {1}\right) = \frac {1}{6} \tau^ {2} \pi^ {2} \theta (1 - \theta) (1 - 2 \theta) + O \left(\tau^ {4}\right), \tag {12}
$$

$$
\operatorname {B i a s} (z) = \frac {1}{6} \tau^ {2} \pi^ {2} F ^ {\prime \prime} \left(F ^ {- 1} (\theta)\right) + O \left(\tau^ {4}\right). \tag {13}
$$

Moreover, when  $F$  is the cdf of a normal variable  $\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ , then

$$
\operatorname {B i a s} (z) = - \frac {1}{6 \sigma^ {2}} \tau^ {2} \pi^ {\frac {3}{2}} \operatorname {e r f} ^ {- 1} (2 \theta - 1) e ^ {- (\operatorname {e r f} ^ {- 1} (2 \theta - 1)) ^ {2}} + O (\tau^ {4}). \tag {14}
$$

Theorem 3 suggests that the icdf method converges equally fast as does the Gumbel trick (both on the order of  $O(\tau^2)$ ). On the other hand, the biases depend on  $\theta$ . Thus, one cannot set temperatures  $\tau$ , independently of the desired probability  $\theta$ , to equate the two biases. In practice,  $\tau$  is a tunable hyperparameter and we use the same tuning range to fairly compare the Gumbel trick and icdf. The rationale is justified in supplement Section F.

We conclude this section by stressing the advantage of the proposed icdf method for differentiably sampling graphs for global model training: it requires fewer random number generations than does the Gumbel trick, saving time and memory.

# 6 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we demonstrate comprehensive experiments to show that federated inference can be effectively conducted by using the proposed framework.

Data sets. We use four real-life, time series data sets. Two are PMU data collected from multiple data owners of the U.S. power grid. For proof of concept, we smooth out heterogeneity and prepare homogeneous data sets. Such a preprocessing is sufficient to test the proposed techniques under minimal impact of the complication by the otherwise diverse local models. Since the PMU data sets are proprietary, we also use two public, traffic data sets (Li et al., 2018) for experimentation. A summary of these data sets is given in Table 1 and the processing details are given in the supplement.

Figure 3: Distributions of prediction entropy across local models.

Experiment setting. All local models are LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) with the same hyperparameters, but pretrained separately by using local data. The local models are not fine-tuned in the training of the global model. Each data set is split randomly for training/validation/testing. See the supplement for further details.

Conflicting local predictions. We first show that local models do not produce consistent predictions, which justifies the effort of training a global model and performing federated inference. For each datum, we compute the entropy of the predicted labels and summarize the entropies for all data into a distribution, plotted in Figure 3. Recall that the lower the entropy, the more consistent the local predictions. The figure, however, shows that a substantial amount of entropies is away from zero, suggesting that local predictions are inconsistent.

Effectiveness of the proposed framework. We make two sets of comprehensive comparisons to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The first set, as outlined in Table 2, compares it with a number of straightforward baselines (A-F) and methods outside the federated inference setting (A and K). This set contains several alignment strategies for local models: (G) no alignment; (I) soft alignment; and (K) hard alignment. A straightforward variant between G and I is H, where a common weight matrix  $W$  is used for all local models, serving as an alternative to alignment. Methods G to J use graph structure learning (icdf method) as the global model.

One sees that methods A to D, either lacking a local model or a global model, perform poorly as expected. Methods E to H perform better than A to D, but they lack a proper alignment of the local models and hence are outperformed by methods I and J that perform alignment. Between the two strategies, neither decisively wins over the other. The advantage of soft alignment is its simplicity and that of hard alignment is the preservation of neuron correspondence.

end training) performs worse than method J (separate training). The result is not surprising, because joint training compromises the optimality of local data representations separately obtained by each local model. We also note this method is outside the setting of federated inference and generally cannot be used unless data owners agree to share data.

Comparison of global models. The other set of comparisons, as outlined in Table 3, extends each alignment strategy (including no alignment) to the role of graphs in the global model: not using a graph, using the given graph, and learning a graph (by using either the Gumbel trick or the icdf method). The numbers in the table suggest that within each alignment strategy, graph structure learning significantly improves the classification. The performance of the Gumbel trick and that of icdf is highly comparable.

Quality of learned permutations. For hard alignment, we investigate the learning of the permutation matrices. According to Theorem 1,  $\sigma_2^2$  of the limit of  $K_{j}$  dictates the convergence speed. Since we do not know the limit, we compute  $\sigma_2^2$  of  $K_{T}$  and summarize them in Table 4 for some local model in each data set, under several involved methods. One sees that all values are close to 1, suggesting that the convergence is indeed rather slow, agreeing with theory. Note that some values are greater than 1 because  $K_{T}$  is not strictly doubly stochastic (owing to slow convergence).

In Figure 4, we visualize  $K_{T}$  for some local model in each data set. The plots clearly show patterns of a permutation matrix: there is one and only one significant value per row and per column. Because of the slow convergence, we attribute the desirable results of  $K_{T}$  (at a small  $T$ ) to the success of the learning of  $K_{0}$ . Note also interestingly that a learned permutation may be the identity mapping.

Comparison of Gumbel softmax and icdf. Prior results suggest that these two approaches for differentiably sampling the Bernoulli distribution perform equally well. An advantage of icdf is its lower computational cost. To demonstrate this advantage, we design a mini-benchmark that highlights the sampling and gradient computation and minimizes the effect of irrelevant complications (such as permutation and GNN). To this end, we generate samples  $(x_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{n},y_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{n})$  for some  $A\in \{0,1\}^{n\times n}$ , where  $y_{i} = Ax_{i} + \mathrm{noise}$ , and use the samples to learn  $A$  through differentiable parameterization. Figure 5 shows the time and memory consumption at a fixed number of learning epochs. As a sanity check, the running time scales nicely as  $O(n^{2})$  as expected (while the memory consumption is complicated; it does not follow  $O(n^{2})$  because of memory management in Python). Overall, one clearly sees the lower computational cost of the icdf method.

We also report the time and memory consumption for the experiments on the four data sets; see Table 5 in the supplement. The results well agree that the icdf method is more economic.

# 7 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we study federated inference, a less addressed scenario of machine learning with distributed data that require collective inference. This scenario is in contrast to federated learning, where inference is local and requires no joint efforts. We motivate the practicality of federated inference by using a power grid example and propose a local-global model framework for it. Two important components of the framework are the alignment of the data representations produced by local models and the learning of the global model by using a graph neural network. Comprehensive experiments suggest the feasibility of federated inference and the effectiveness of the framework.
