# ABSTRACT

Recent research has shown that numerous human-interpretable directions exist in the latent space of GANs. In this paper, we develop an automatic procedure for finding directions that lead to foreground-background image separation, and we use these directions to train an image segmentation model without human supervision. Our method is generator-agnostic, producing strong segmentation results with a wide range of different GAN architectures. Furthermore, by leveraging GANs pretrained on large datasets such as ImageNet, we are able to segment images from a range of domains without further training or finetuning. Evaluating our method on image segmentation benchmarks, we compare favorably to prior work while using neither human supervision nor access to the training data. Broadly, our results demonstrate that automatically extracting foreground-background structure from pretrained deep generative models can serve as a remarkably effective substitute for human supervision.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Recent years have seen rapid progress in the field of deep generative modeling of images, driven by a proliferation of research into Generative Adversaial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Nowadays, it is possible to generate high-resolution images of realistic objects and scenes (Karras et al., 2019; Brock et al., 2019). However, with the exception of generation for computer graphics, there has been limited research into how we might be able to leverage the representations learned by these powerful generative models to enhance other tasks, particularly those involving semantic understanding (e.g. classification or segmentation).

Generally, deep generative models learn to map latent codes to images, imposing simple statistical structures on the distribution of the latent codes, such as assuming an i.i.d. Gaussian distribution. Due to this structure, in some cases code dimensions acquire specific meanings which can be related to human-interpretable concepts (e.g., the rotation or size of an object); however, the code space in high-quality generators (e.g., BigGAN (Brock et al., 2019), BigBiGANs (Donahue & Simonyan, 2019), StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019)) is usually not easily interpretable. Nonetheless, it is intuitive that an efficient generative process should account for the structure of natural images, including for example the fact that images often comprise distinct foreground and background regions.

In this paper, we validate this hypothesis by learning to separate foreground and background image regions from generator networks. Our approach starts from an arbitrary, off-the-shelf high-quality generator network trained on a large corpus of (unlabeled) images. While these generator networks are not explicitly trained for foreground/background segmentation, we show that such a separation emerges implicitly as a step to efficiently encode realistically-looking images. Specifically, we design a probing scheme that can extract such foreground/background information automatically, i.e. without manual supervision, from the generated images.

This scheme works as follows (cf. Fig. 1). We start from a random code in latent space and learn a fixed, global offset that results in a change in the generated images. The offset is learned to alter the appearance of foreground and background such that a mask can be extracted from the changes in image space.

The resulting masks provide segmentation maps for the generated images, but they cannot yet be used to segment images from the real world. Given a natural image, the obvious approach would

be to find the corresponding code in the latent space of the generator, and then obtain a mask with our method. Unfortunately, this inversion process is less than trivial. In fact, recent work provides strong evidence that the expressiveness of GANs is insufficient to encode arbitrary images (Bau et al., 2019), meaning that the inversion problem has no solution in general.

As we aim to build a general-purpose segmentation method, we take a different approach: we generate a labelled image dataset with foreground/background segmentations and use the generated dataset to train a standard segmentation network. With this, we show that our method can successfully learn accurate foreground-background segmentation networks with no manually provided labels at all. Differently from prior work in GAN-based image segmentation, we neither design a new GAN architecture specifically for the task of segmentation nor use manual supervision to extract segmentation information from an existing GAN. Thus, we can discover meaningful latent directions for any GAN with no need for model-specific manual intervention.

Extensive experiments on five segmentation datasets across twelve different GANs demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Moreover, by constructing our image segmenters from generator networks trained on a generic large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, our method can learn to generically segment objects from a wide range of visual domains. Specifically, when we apply our generic segmenters to the CUB200 (Welinder et al., 2010) and Oxford Flowers (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2009a) datasets, we attain very strong foreground-background results despite not training on this data. Similarly, when we apply our generic segmenters to three saliency detection benchmarks, our method approaches and sometimes even exceeds the performance of supervised and handcrafted saliency detection methods. An analysis of our results also shows that segmentation performance directly correlates with the quality of the underlying GAN, suggesting that foreground/background separation is an important concept in learning generative models.

Finally, we demonstrate that our method may be used as a drop-in replacement for saliency networks for the purpose of learning pixel-wise semantic image representations. These pixel-wise representations can then be clustered to obtain fully unsupervised semantic segmentations, extending our method beyond foreground-background segmentation. Thus, we not only demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to obtain semantic segmentations using GANs, but also that this information may be extracted from a wide range of generic GANs trained on general-purpose image datasets.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Below, we describe how our method relates to recent work in interpreting generative models and object segmentation. Due to space constraints, we include additional related work in the Appendix.

Interpreting Deep Generative Models. Several works have proposed methods for decomposing the latent space of a generative model into interpretable or disentangled directions. Early work included Beta-VAE (Higgins et al., 2017), which modified the variational ELBO in the original VAE formulation, and InfoGAN (Chen et al., 2016), which maximized the mutual information between a subset of the latent code and the generated data. Later work has sought to disentangle factors of variation by mixing latent codes (Hu et al., 2018), adding additional adversarial losses (Mathieu et al., 2016), and using contrastive learning (Ren et al., 2021).

Our work follows a recent line of research that looks for structure in large, pretrained generative models. Shen & Zhou (2020) perform a direct decomposition of model weights to find disentangled

directions, while Peebles et al. (2020) penalize nonzero second-order interactions between different latent dimensions, and Voynov & Babenko (2020) find interpretable directions by introducing an additional reconstruction network.

Differently from the works above, we conduct a deep study of one specific type of structure (foreground/background separation) encoded in the latent space. Other works have taken this approach in the context of extracting 3D structure from 2D images; for example, IG-GAN (Lunz et al., 2020) uses a neural renderer to recover 3D (voxel-based) representations of scenes, and GAN2Shape (Pan et al., 2021) exploits viewpoint and lighting variations in generated images to recover 3D shapes.

Unsupervised Object Segmentation. Prior work on unsupervised object segmentation can be divided into two categories: those that employ generative models to obtain segmentation masks and those that employ purely discriminative methods such as contrastive learning (Ji et al., 2019a; Ouali et al., 2020). Here, we focus on generative approaches.

Nearly all generative approaches are based on the idea of decomposing the generative process in a layer-wise fashion; in general, the foreground and background of an image are generated separately and then combined to obtain a final image. Specifically, ReDo (Chen et al., 2019) trains a generator to re-draw new objects on top of old objects, and enforces realism through adversarial training. (Bielski & Favaro, 2019b) generates a background, a foreground, and a foreground mask separately and composite them together; they prevent degenerate outputs (i.e. the foreground and background being the same) by randomly shifting the foreground relative to the background. CopyPaste GAN (Arandjelović & Zisserman, 2019) receives two images as input and copies parts of one image onto the other. OneGAN (Benny & Wolf, 2020) learns to simultaneously generate, cluster, and segment images with a combination of GANs, VAEs, and additional encoders. Equivariant Layered GAN (Yang et al., 2021) first trains a new layerwise GAN and then trains a segmentation network on synthetic data. Labels4Free (Abdal et al., 2021) proposes a new layerwise network inspired by StyleGAN for foreground-background segmentation. Common difficulties with these layer-wise approaches above include the challenges of training new GANs and scaling beyond simple datasets (e.g. CUB, Flowers).

One recent work along different lines is by Voynov et al. (2020), which uses a pretrained BigBiGAN (Donahue & Simonyan, 2019) generator rather than proposing a new layer-wise GAN. Voynov et al. (2020) use the method from Voynov & Babenko (2020) to decompose the latent space into interpretable directions, manually handpicks a direction that separates the foreground and background, and then uses the direction to train a segmentation model. This method is still supervised, however, in the sense that a person must manually select the desired latent direction by examining hundreds of images (since there are more than 100 candidate latent directions).

Our approach is based on generative modeling, but it differs from other approaches in that we seek a general method to find foreground/background structure implicitly encoded in standard, non-layerwise GANs rather than encoding it explicitly or searching for it manually. This enables us to leverage any of the numerous existing generators that have already been pretrained on millions of high-resolution images, rather than developing a new GAN architecture for this specific task. Differently from layer-wise approaches, our approach does not require training new GANs and it does not rely on the assumption that the foreground and background of an image are independent. Differently from Voynov et al. (2020), our method applies to arbitrary GANs, it requires no human supervision, and it delivers superior performance across object segmentation and saliency detection benchmarks.

Furthermore, unlike any of these previous works, we demonstrate that our foreground-background segmentation network can be used as a drop-in replacement for saliency networks for the task of learning dense semantic image representations. By clustering these representations, we are able to extend our method from foreground-background segmentation to semantic segmentation.

# 3 METHOD

Let  $x \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times H \times W}$  be a (color) image. A generator (network) is a function  $G: \mathbb{R}^D \to \mathbb{R}^{3 \times H \times W}$  that maps code variables  $z$  to images  $x = G(z)$ . Optionally, some generative models come with an encoder function  $E: \mathbb{R}^{3 \times H \times W} \to \mathbb{R}^D$  which computes an approximate inverse of the generator (i.e.  $G(E(x)) \approx x$ ).

Figure 2: Our unsupervised segmentation pipeline. First (left), a direction is identified in the latent space of a deep generative model  $(G)$  that separates the foreground and background of generated images by changing their relative brightness. Second (right), a synthetic dataset is generated using this direction (or two of these directions) and is used to train a separate segmentation network  $(S)$ . This network can then be applied to unseen real-world data without further training.

A challenge in generating images is that individual pixels exhibit complex correlations, caused by the fact that the images are obtained as the composition of a number of different objects. For example, all pixels that belong to a dog have a similar color, characteristic of dog's instance. However, the correlation is much less strong between pixels that belong to different objects. This is because, while object in a scene are not entirely independent, their correlation is much weaker than within the structure of objects.

Intuitively, an image generator must learn to account for such correlations in order to generate realistically-looking images. In particular, we expect the generator to capture the idea that pixels that belong to the same object have a related appearance, whereas the appearance of pixels that belong to different objects or, as it may be, to a foreground object and its background, should be much more statistically independent.

Given a generator function  $G$ , it is then natural to ask whether such correlations can be extracted and used not just for the purpose of generating images, but also for analyzing them. In order to explore this idea, we consider perturbing the code  $z$  via a small increment  $\epsilon v \in \mathbb{R}^D$ , where  $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$  and  $v \in \mathbb{S}^{D-1}$  is a unit vector. Because the dimension  $D$  of the embedding space is typically much smaller than the dimension  $3HW$  of the generated images, codes provide highly-compressed views of the data (for example,  $D = 120$  for BigBiGAN (Donahue & Simonyan, 2019) and the self-conditioned GAN). As such, most changes in the code are likely to affect most if not all pixels in the image. However, if the generator did in fact learn to compose objects, then one could hope too find specific variations  $v$  that only affect only portions of the image, corresponding to individual objects, and use the latter to highlight and segment them.

Empirically, we find that the situation is not as simple. Specifically, it is not easy to find changes in the code that leave part of the pixels exactly constant while changing other pixels. However, we find that there are directions that affect foreground and background regions in a systematic and characteristic manner. Furthermore, we show that these directions are 'universal', in the sense that the same  $v$  works for all codes  $z$ , and are thus characteristic of a given generator network  $G$ .

# 3.1 FINDING INFORMATIVE CODE VARIATIONS

Next, we introduce an automated criterion to select informative changes  $v$  in code space. To this end, we consider an image  $x = G(z)$  generated from a random code  $z \sim \mathcal{Z}$ , where  $\mathcal{Z}$  is the code distribution characteristic of the generator (e.g. an i.i.d. Gaussian). We then consider a modified image  $x' = G(z + \epsilon v)$  and observe the change  $x \to x'$ .

We compare the two images using two criteria. The first one preserves the structure of the image  $x$ . We capture the latter by imposing that  $x$  and  $x'$  generate approximately the same edges when fed to a simple edge detector. The intuition is that we wish  $v$  to affect the appearance of objects without changing their shape. By preventing objects from 'moving around' the image or deforming, we make it significantly easier to extract an image segmentation from the change  $x \rightarrow x'$ . This loss

A value of  $\epsilon = 0.0$  corresponds to the original image, lighter), and the combination  $v_{b}$  and  $v_{l}$ . Using both with a random Gaussian latent vector  $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . directions yields visually superior segmentations.

takes the form:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {s} (v) = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \| S (G (z _ {i} + \epsilon v)) - S (G (z _ {i})) \| ^ {2}
$$

where  $z_{i}\sim \mathcal{Z}$  and  $S$  is the Sobel-Feldman operator:

$$
[ S (x) ] _ {i j} = \sum_ {c = 1} ^ {3} (g * x _ {c::}) _ {i j} ^ {2} + (g ^ {\top} * x _ {c::}) _ {i j} ^ {2},
$$

and  $g = \left[ \begin{array}{lll}1 & 2 & 1 \end{array} \right]\cdot \left[ \begin{array}{lll}1 & 0 & -1 \end{array} \right]^{\top}$

This loss encourages  $x$  and  $x'$  to be similar. We thus also need a loss that encourages the direction  $v$  to explore a non-zero change of the image. We consider an image contrast variation and additionally exploit the photographer bias, that objects are often placed in the middle of the image. This is captured by the loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {c} (v) = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {c = 1} ^ {3} \langle G (z + \epsilon v), r \rangle
$$

where  $r\in \mathbb{R}^{H\times W}$  is a 'radial' prior:

$$
r _ {i j} = 1 - \frac {1}{\alpha} \sqrt {\left(i - \frac {H + 1}{2}\right) ^ {2} + \left(j - \frac {W + 1}{2}\right) ^ {2}}
$$

with normalization factor  $\alpha = \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(H - 1)^2 + (W - 1)^2}$  that linearly interpolates from 1 in the center of the image to  $-1$  at the boundary. This encourages finding a direction  $v$  that changes the brightness in the center of the image opposite to the border. In order to learn  $v$ , the two losses are combined with a weighting factor  $\lambda$ .

$$
\mathcal {L} (v) = \lambda \mathcal {L} _ {c} (v) + \mathcal {L} _ {s} (v) \tag {1}
$$

Given this fully-automatic procedure, the latent code direction  $v$  may be thought of as a function of the generator  $G$  and the weighting factor  $\lambda$ .

# 3.1.1 COMBINING INFORMATIVE CODES

Optimizing Eq. (1) with  $\lambda > 0$  encourages the network to produce a shift  $v$  that brightens the foreground and darkens the background of an image. However, there is no constraint that  $\lambda$  need be positive; by negating  $\lambda$  and optimizing a second time, we obtain another direction  $v$  that shifts the foreground dark and the background light.

Although using only one direction suffices for our method, we find that we can improve performance by using both. As a result, for the remainder of the paper, let  $v_{l}$  represent the direction that shifts the foreground lighter, and  $v_{d}$  represent the direction that shifts the foreground darker.

# 3.2 LEARNING A SEGMENTATION MODEL

Once the latent directions  $v_{d}$  and  $v_{l}$  have been found, the process of extracting a segmentation mask is straightforward: we label as foreground regions the pixels in which the image generated with the foreground-lighter shifted latent code is lighter than the image generated with the foreground-darker shifted latent code. That is, for a generated image  $x = G(z)$ , we have:

$$
M (z) = \operatorname {s i g n} \left(G \left(z + \epsilon v _ {l}\right) - G \left(z + \epsilon v _ {b}\right)\right) \tag {2}
$$

Alternatively, if we use only a single direction  $v_{l}$  or  $v_{b}$ ,  $M(z)$  is set to either:

$$
G (z + \epsilon v _ {l}) - G (z) \quad \text {o r} \quad G (z) - G (z + \epsilon v _ {b}) \tag {3}
$$

Given the learned direction  $v$ , we use it to generate a training set as follows:

$$
\mathcal {D} = \{(G (z _ {i}), M (z _ {i})): z _ {i} \sim \mathcal {Z}, i = 1, \ldots \}.
$$

This dataset may then be used to train any dense segmentation network  $\Psi$  (i.e., a UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015)) in the standard fashion. That is, we minimize the pixel-wise binary cross-entropy loss between the segmentation output  $\Psi(G(z)) \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W}$  and the (synthesized) mask  $M(z)$ :

$$
\mathcal {L} (\Psi | z) = - \frac {1}{H W} \sum_ {u \in [ H ] \times [ W ]} \log p \left(\operatorname {s i g n} \left(M _ {u} (z)\right) \mid \Psi_ {u} (G (z))\right)
$$

where  $p(m|s) = m\sigma(s) + (1 - m)\sigma(-s)$ ,  $u$  is a pixel index and sign is the sign function. Unlike previous object segmentation methods, our method requires no additional losses or constraints to ensure the stability of training. By sampling  $z$ , we can generate an 'infinite' dataset for learning the network  $\Psi$ . Although we described the procedure above for unconditional GANs, our method applies just as well for weakly-supervised conditional GANs, where the generator  $G(z,y)$  also depends on a class label; we simply sample a label  $y$  uniformly at random for each generated image.

# 3.2.1 REFINING THE GENERATED DATASET

An advantage of training with GAN-generated data is that the dataset size is infinite, which means that one is free to curate one's dataset and discard uninformative training examples. In our case, we found that it was helpful to refine the dataset by (1) discarding images with masks that were too large, (2) discarding images for which the latent code shift did not produce a significant change in brightness, and (3) removing small connected components from the mask. The exact details are given in the Supplementary Material.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we present an extensive set of experiments demonstrating the method's performance, its wide applicability across image datasets, and its generalizability across GAN architectures.

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

As our method is generator-agnostic, we apply our method to twelve generators, including three unconditional and nine conditional GANs. For the three unconditional GANs (BigBiGAN (Donahue & Simonyan, 2019), SelfCondGAN (Liu et al., 2020b), and UncondGAN (Liu et al., 2020b)), our procedure is completely unsupervised. For conditional GANs, our method is still unsupervised but the GAN naturally relies on class supervision for training.

To demonstrate the efficacy of our method across resolutions and datasets, we implement both, GANs trained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) at a resolution of  $128\mathrm{px}$ , and GANs trained on the smaller TinyImageNet dataset (100,000 images split into 200 classes) at a resolution of  $64\mathrm{px}$ . All experiments performed across all GANs utilize the same set of hyperparameters for both optimization and segmentation. This is a key advantage of our method relative to other unsupervised/weakly-supervised image segmentation methods (Chen et al., 2019; Bielski & Favaro, 2019a; Benny & Wolf, 2020; Arandjelovic & Zisserman, 2019), which are sensitive to dataset-specific hyperparameters.

# 4.2 EVALUATION DATA

We evaluate the performance of our model on three standard saliency detection benchmarks (DUT- Omrom (Yang et al., 2013), DUTS (Wang et al., 2017), ECSSD (Shi et al., 2016)) and two standard object segmentation benchmarks (CUB (Welinder et al., 2010), and Flowers-102 (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2009b)). For the saliency datasets, we evaluate using (pixel-wise) accuracy, mean intersection-over-union (IoU), and  $F_{\beta}$  -score with  $\beta^2 = 0.3$  . For the object segmentation datasets, we evaluate using accuracy, IoU, and max  $F_{\beta}$  (the maximum  $F_{\beta}$  score over a range of 255 uniformly distributed binarization thresholds between O and 1).

# 4.3 RESULTS

Performance on Benchmarks. In Table 1, we compare our method to other recent work. We emphasize that our method uses the same model for all datasets and has not seen any of the (training or evaluation) data for these datasets before. Our method delivers strong performance across datasets,

approaching and even outperforming some supervised/handcrafted saliency detection methods. In comparison to Voynov et al. (2020), we perform better on four out of five benchmarks (all except CUB), even though we do not rely on humans to hand-pick latent directions. In comparison to layerwise GANs (Chen et al., 2019; Bielski & Favaro, 2019a; Benny & Wolf, 2020; Arandjelovic & Zisserman, 2019), we perform similarly on CUB and Flowers-102, but we cannot compare our method with layerwise GANs on complex datasets (e.g. DUTS) because they do not produce any meaningful results. Due to the difficulty of training GANs, they are only ever trained on datasets consisting of images from a single domain with a single main subject, such as birds or flowers. By contrast, our ability to leverage pre-trained generators means that our method scales to complex and diverse datasets, such as those used for saliency detection.

Performance across Generators. We investigate the generality of our method by performing the same optimization and training pipeline with twelve different GANs. For each generator, we optimize to obtain a latent direction  $v_{l}$ , train a segmentation model using this direction, and evaluate its performance across the five datasets above. The same hyperparameters are kept constant for all GANs, including  $\lambda = 5.0$  during the optimization phase.

Results are shown in Table 2; BigBiGAN performs best, but all networks, even those using relatively weak TinyImageNet-trained GANs (e.g., GGAN (Lim & Ye, 2017)), deliver reasonable segmentation performance. This highlights the benefits of our fully-automatic segmentation pipeline; our method performs well

Figure 4: A plot of Frechet Inception Distance (FID) versus average segmentation accuracy across all five evaluation datasets (CUB, Flowers, DUT-OMRON, DUTS, ECSSD) for nine different GAN architectures. Lower FIDs are better (note that the x-axis is reversed). Lower FID scores correlate with improved final segmentation accuracy.

across a wide range of generators trained on different datasets at different resolutions.

Naturally, the quality of a final segmentation network produced by our method is related to the quality of the underlying generator. Figure 4 plots the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of nine conditional GANs versus the average accuracy of the corresponding segmentation networks produced by our method. Lower FID scores, which correspond to better GANs, correlate with improved accuracy. This correlation suggests that as better GANs architectures are developed, our method will continue to produce better unsupervised segmentation networks.

Ablation: Comparing latent directions. We compare the performance of a segmentation masks using the two latent directions  $v_{b}$  and  $v_{l}$  together (Eq. (2)), or each of them individually (Eq. (3)) visually in Fig. 3a. In Table 6, we quantitatively compare the results of these three methods along with a fourth method in which we ensemble the final segmentation networks produced by  $v_{b}$  and  $v_{l}$  individually. The foreground-lighter  $(v_{l})$  and foreground-darker  $(v_{b})$  directions yield similar results when used individually. The combination  $(v_{l}$  and  $v_{b})$  provides superior results, on par with the ensemble. Unlike the ensemble, which requires training two networks, the combination of  $v_{b}$  and  $v_{l}$  adds minimal overhead compared to training with one direction.

Ablation: Varying  $\lambda, \epsilon$ , the Central Prior, Random Initializations. The two hyperparameters in the optimization stage of our method are  $\lambda$ , which controls the trade-off between brightness and consistency, and  $\epsilon$ , which controls the magnitude of the perturbation. We find that the process is only modestly sensitive to changes in these hyperparameters. We also find that using the central prior compared to a spatially-agnostic loss term is better, but only moderately. Detailed numerical results are given in Section A.3.

Qualitative Results. By inspection, we find that our optimization procedure is able to edit images in such a manner that the foreground becomes lighter and the background becomes darker. In numerous cases, the network appears to convert the scene from daytime to nighttime. Furthermore, better GANs generally produce qualitatively better segmentations. Please refer to Appendix A and Section A.1.3 for illustrations.

The mIoU is computed over the 20 classes by performing Hungarian matching between the clusters obtained from  $K$ -means and the ground truth. All networks use a ResNet backbone. We compare with numerous baselines, including using self-supervised features directly (i.e. MoCo, SwaV) and IIC. Compared to Van Gansbeke et al. (2021), we achieve competitive performance, but our pipeline is entirely unsupervised, whereas theirs uses a saliency network which was initialized with a supervised network pretrained for semantic segmentation on CityScapes.

# 4.4 EXTENSION TO SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION

Finally, we demonstrate that our network may be extended from binary foreground-background segmentation to semantic segmentation, the task of assigning each pixel in an image into one of  $K$  semantic categories. Due to the challenging nature of this task, it has not been attempted by any previous works in the GAN-based segmentation space.

We extend our method by following the dense contrastive learning approach proposed by Van Gansbeke et al. (2021). In this approach, binary masks are extracted from a set of images using a foreground-background segmentation model, sometimes called a "mid-level visual prior." Then, a network is trained to generate pixel-wise features using a mask-based contrastive loss: features corresponding to pixels in the foreground of the image are pulled toward the features of other pixels in the mask and pushed away from the features of background pixels. After training, semantic segmentations may be extracted by clustering these pixel-wise features across an entire dataset.

Importantly, Van Gansbeke et al. (2021) uses saliency detection networks to generate their object masks. Although these saliency detectors are sometimes called "unsupervised," they are actually initialized using pretrained semantic segmentation networks<sup>1</sup>. We propose to use our object segmentation network as a drop-in replacement for these saliency networks, making the entire process entirely unsupervised. We leave the rest of their method (i.e. the dense contrastive learning and the evaluation procedure) unchanged.

We perform experiments on the PASCAL VOC dataset, which contains 20 semantic classes. Experimental details are included in Section A.1.3 and K-Means clustering results are shown in Table 3. We compare to a range of baselines, along with two models from Van Gansbeke et al. (2021) using different levels of supervised pretraining. Our network is competitive with Van Gansbeke et al. (2021) despite being entirely unsupervised. Furthermore, in Table 4 in Section A.1.3 we show that this procedure works for a wide range of GANs, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

We find that extracting a salient object segmentation from the latent space of a GAN is not only possible without supervision but also leads to state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation performance on several benchmark datasets. In contrast to existing methods that have been engineered specifically for this task, we extract segmentations from a network trained for a very different purpose — generating images. Surprisingly, we are able to generalize to a wide range of segmentation benchmarks without directly training on any real images, and even extend our results to semantic segmentation. Our findings directly prompt future research questions about what other concepts of the physical world can be automatically extracted from generative models, and to what extent we can use such extracted concepts to replace human supervision in other computer vision tasks.

# 6 REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

We aim to ensure that our experiments are entirely and easily reproducible. We upload code to the Supplementary Material to fully reproduce all experiments. This code contains a README file with a detailed description of the code structure, which should help enable others to reproduce and later extend upon our work. We also take care to describe all hyperparameters and implementation details in the Appendix. Our results do not require extremely large amounts of compute; they can be reproduced with a single GPU by researchers with computational constraints.

# 7 ETHICS STATEMENT

It is important to discuss the potential ethical issues involved with training large-scale generative models and segmentation networks along the lines proposed by our paper.

First of all, the task of segmentation is predicated upon classifying objects into predetermined (either binary or semantic) categories; the definition of these categories, especially in the case of semantic segmentation, may introduce biases into the task itself. Second, when training models on large-scale datasets, it is essential to consider the biases and data privacy issues introduced in the data collection process. For example, the PASCAL-VOC dataset, which we use for the task of semantic segmentation, is composed of images scraped from Flickr. As a result, it is composed primarily of photographs from the United States and Europe, and the "person" class contains primarily images of white individuals. Additionally, it is not clear whether the individuals in these photographs consent to being used to train image segmentation models, bringing up the issue of data privacy.

From an ethical perspective, our method is slightly different from standard segmentation models because it is trained solely on GAN-generated images; this is not to say that it is ethically better or worse, but that it involves different ethical considerations. On the one hand, this might alleviate some data privacy concerns, as the segmentation training data is synthetic. However, since this training data is generated by a GAN, one has to examine the data and methodology originally used to pretrain the GAN; any biases present in this data will likely be reproduced or amplified by the GAN. For example, if one uses a GAN trained on ImageNet to perform object segmentation, it may perform better on white individuals than individuals of other races due to the disproportionate percentage of white individuals in the training data (Steed & Caliskan, 2021). Investigating biases introduced by GANs remains an active area of research in the machine learning community (Jain et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020), and these ethical discussions extend to our GAN-based segmentation method.
