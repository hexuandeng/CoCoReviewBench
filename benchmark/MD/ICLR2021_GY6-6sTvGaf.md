# ABSTRACT

Existing model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are effective when trained on states but struggle to learn directly from image observations. We propose an augmentation technique that can be applied to standard model-free RL algorithms, enabling robust learning directly from pixels without the need for auxiliary losses or pre-training. The approach leverages input perturbations commonly used in computer vision tasks to transform input examples, as well as regularizing the value function and policy. Our approach reaches a new state-of-the-art performance on DeepMind control suite and Atari 100k benchmark, surpassing previous model-free (Haarnoja et al., 2018; van Hasselt et al., 2019a), model-based (Hafner et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Hafner et al., 2018; Kaiser et al., 2019) and contrastive learning (Srinivas et al., 2020) approaches. It also closes the gap between state-based and image-based RL training. Our method, which we dub

DrQ: Data-regularized Q, can be combined with any model-free RL algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first effective data augmentation method for RL on these benchmarks.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms capable of directly training from image pixels would open up many real-world applications in control and robotics. However, simultaneously training a convolutional encoder alongside a policy network is challenging when given limited environment interaction, strong correlation between samples and a typically sparse reward signal. Limited supervision is a common problem across AI and two approaches are commonly taken: (i) training with an additional auxiliary losses, such as those based on self-supervised learning (SSL) and (ii) training with data augmentation.

A wide range of auxiliary loss functions have been proposed to augment supervised objectives, e.g. weight regularization, noise injection (Hinton et al., 2012), or various forms of auto-encoder (Kingma et al., 2014). In RL, reconstruction losses (Jaderberg et al., 2017; Yarats et al., 2019) or SSL objectives (Dwibedi et al., 2018; Srinivas et al., 2020) are used. However, these objectives are unrelated to the task at hand, thus have no guarantee of inducing an appropriate representation for the policy network. SSL losses are highly effective in the large data regime, e.g. in domains such as vision (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2019) and NLP (Collobert et al., 2011; Devlin et al., 2018) where large (unlabeled) datasets are readily available. However, in sample-efficient RL, training data is more limited due to restricted interaction between the agent and the environment, limiting their effectiveness.

Data augmentation methods are widely used in vision and speech domains, where output-invariant perturbations can easily be applied to the labeled input examples. Surprisingly, data augmentation has received little attention in the RL community. In this paper we propose augmentation approaches appropriate for sample-efficient RL and comprehensively evaluate them. The key idea of our approach is to use standard image transformations to perturb input observations, as well as regularizing the  $Q$ -function learned by the critic so that different transformations of the same input image have similar  $Q$ -function values. No further modifications to standard actor-critic algorithms are required. Our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first careful examination of image augmentation in sample-efficient RL.

The main contributions of the paper are as follows: (i) the first to demonstrate that data augmentation greatly improves performance when training model-free RL algorithms from images; (ii) introducing a natural way to exploit MDP structure through two mechanisms for regularizing the value function, in a manner that is generally applicable to model-free RL and (iii) setting a new state-of-the-art performance on the standard DeepMind control suite (Tassa et al., 2018), closing the gap between learning from states, and Atari 100k (Kaiser et al., 2019) benchmarks.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Data Augmentation in Computer Vision Data augmentation via image transformations has been used to improve generalization since the inception of convolutional networks (Becker & Hinton, 1992; Simard et al., 2003; LeCun et al., 1989; Ciresan et al., 2011; Ciregan et al., 2012). Following AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), they have become a standard part of training pipelines. For object classification tasks, the transformations are selected to avoid changing the semantic category, i.e. translations, scales, color shifts, etc. While a similar set of transformations are potentially applicable to control tasks, the RL context does require modifications to be made to the underlying algorithm.

Data augmentation methods have also been used in the context of self-supervised learning. Dosovitskiy et al. (2016) use per-exemplar perturbations in a unsupervised classification framework. More recently, several approaches (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2019; Misra & van der Maaten, 2019) have used invariance to imposed image transformations in contrastive learning schemes, producing state-of-the-art results on downstream recognition tasks. By contrast, our scheme addresses control tasks, utilizing different types of invariance.

Data Augmentation in RL In contrast to computer vision, data augmentation is rarely used in RL. Certain approaches implicitly adopt it, for example Levine et al. (2018); Kalashnikov et al. (2018) use image augmentation as part of the AlexNet training pipeline without analysing the benefits occurring from it, thus being overlooked in subsequent work. HER (Andrychowicz et al., 2017) exploits information about the observation space by goal and reward relabeling, which can be viewed as a way to perform data augmentation. Other work uses data augmentation to improve generalization in domain transfer (Cobbe et al., 2018). However, the classical image transformations used in vision have not previously been shown to definitively help on standard RL benchmarks. Concurrent with our work, RAD (Laskin et al., 2020) performs an exploration of different data augmentation approaches, but is limited to transformations of the image alone, without the additional augmentation of the Q-function used in our approach. Moreover, RAD can be regarded as a special case of our algorithm.

Continuous Control from Pixels There are a variety of methods addressing the sample-efficiency of RL algorithms that directly learn from pixels. The most prominent approaches for this can be classified into two groups, model-based and model-free methods. The model-based methods attempt to learn the system dynamics in order to acquire a compact latent representation of high-dimensional observations to later perform policy search (Hafner et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Hafner et al., 2019). In contrast, the model-free methods either learn the latent representation indirectly by optimizing the RL objective (Barth-Maron et al., 2018; Abdelmaleki et al., 2018) or by employing auxiliary losses that provide additional supervision (Yarats et al., 2019; Srinivas et al., 2020; Sermanet et al., 2018; Dwibedi et al., 2018). Our approach is complementary to these methods and can be combined with them to improve performance.

# 3 BACKGROUND

Reinforcement Learning from Images We formulate image-based control as an infinite-horizon partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) (Bellman, 1957; Kaelbling et al., 1998). An POMDP can be described as the tuple  $(\mathcal{O},\mathcal{A},p,r,\gamma)$ , where  $\mathcal{O}$  is the high-dimensional observation space (image pixels),  $\mathcal{A}$  is the action space, the transition dynamics  $p = Pr(o_t'|o_{\leq t},a_t)$  capture the probability distribution over the next observation  $o_t^\prime$  given the history of previous observations  $o_{\leq t}$  and current action  $a_{t},r:\mathcal{O}\times \mathcal{A}\to \mathbb{R}$  is the reward function that maps the current observation and action to a reward  $r_t = r(o_{\leq t},a_t)$ , and  $\gamma \in [0,1)$  is a discount factor. Per common practice (Mnih et al., 2013), throughout the paper the POMDP is converted into an MDP (Bellman, 1957) by stacking several consecutive image observations into a state  $s_t = \{o_t,o_{t - 1},o_{t - 2},\ldots \}$ . For simplicity we redefine the transition dynamics  $p = Pr(s_t'|s_t,a_t)$  and the reward function  $r_t = r(s_t,a_t)$ . We then

aim to find a policy  $\pi (a_t|s_t)$  that maximizes the cumulative discounted return  $\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[\sum_{t = 1}^{\infty}\gamma^{t}r_{t}|a_{t}\sim$ $\pi (\cdot |s_t),s_t^\prime \sim p(\cdot |s_t,a_t),s_1\sim p(\cdot)]$

Soft Actor-Critic The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018) learns a state-action value function  $Q_{\theta}$ , a stochastic policy  $\pi_{\theta}$  and a temperature  $\alpha$  to find an optimal policy for an MDP  $(S, \mathcal{A}, p, r, \gamma)$  by optimizing a  $\gamma$ -discounted maximum-entropy objective (Ziebart et al., 2008).  $\theta$  is used generically to denote the parameters updated through training in each part of the model.

Deep Q-learning DQN (Mnih et al., 2013) also learns a convolutional neural net to approximate Q-function over states and actions. The main difference is that DQN operates on discrete actions spaces, thus the policy can be directly inferred from Q-values. In practice, the standard version of DQN is frequently combined with a set of refinements that improve performance and training stability, commonly known as Rainbow (van Hasselt et al., 2015). For simplicity, the rest of the paper describes a generic actor-critic algorithm rather than DQN or SAC in particular. Further background on DQN and SAC can be found in Appendix A.

# 4 SAMPLE EFFICIENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FROM Pixels

# 4.1 OPTIMALITY INVARIANT IMAGE TRANSFORMATIONS FOR Q FUNCTION

We first introduce a general framework for regularizing the value function through transformations of the input state. For a given task, we define an optimality invariant state transformation  $f: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{S}$  as a mapping that preserves the  $Q$ -values

$$
Q (s, a) = Q (f (s, \nu), a) \text {f o r a l l} s \in \mathcal {S}, a \in \mathcal {A} \text {a n d} \nu \in \mathcal {T}.
$$

where  $\nu$  are the parameters of  $f(\cdot)$ , drawn from the set of all possible parameters  $\mathcal{T}$ . One example of such transformations are the random image translations successfully applied in the previous section.

For every state, the transformations allow the generation of several surrogate states with the same  $Q$ -values, thus providing a mechanism to reduce the variance of  $Q$ -function estimation. In particular, for an arbitrary distribution of states  $\mu(\cdot)$  and policy  $\pi$ , instead of using a single sample  $s^* \sim \mu(\cdot)$ ,  $a^* \sim \pi(\cdot | s^*)$  estimation of the following expectation

$$
\mathbb{E}_{\substack{s\sim \mu (\cdot)\\ a\sim \pi (\cdot |s)}}[Q(s,a)]\approx Q(s^{*},a^{*})
$$

we generate  $K$  samples via random transformations and obtain an estimate with lower variance

$$
\mathbb{E}_{\substack{s\sim \mu (\cdot)\\ a\sim \pi (\cdot |s)}}[Q(s,a)]\approx \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k = 1}^{K}Q(f(s^{*},\nu_{k}),a_{k})\text{where}\nu_{k}\in \mathcal{T}\text{and} a_{k}\sim \pi (\cdot |f(s^{*},\nu_{k}))
$$

This suggests two distinct ways to regularize  $Q$ -function. First, we use the data augmentation to compute the target values for every transition tuple  $(s_i, a_i, r_i, s_i')$  as

$$
y _ {i} = r _ {i} + \gamma \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} Q _ {\theta} \left(f \left(s _ {i} ^ {\prime}, v _ {i, k} ^ {\prime}\right), a _ {i, k} ^ {\prime}\right) \text {w h e r e} a _ {i, k} ^ {\prime} \sim \pi (\cdot | f \left(s _ {i} ^ {\prime}, v _ {i, k} ^ {\prime}\right)) \tag {1}
$$

where  $\nu_{i,k}^{\prime}\in \mathcal{T}$  corresponds to a transformation parameter of  $s_i^\prime$ . Then the Q-function is updated using these targets through an SGD update using learning rate  $\lambda_{\theta}$

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \lambda_ {\theta} \nabla_ {\theta} \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \left(Q _ {\theta} \left(f \left(s _ {i}, v _ {i}\right), a _ {i}\right) - y _ {i}\right) ^ {2}. \tag {2}
$$

In tandem, we note that the same target from Equation (1) can be used for different augmentations of  $s_i$ , resulting in the second regularization approach

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \lambda_ {\theta} \nabla_ {\theta} \frac {1}{N M} \sum_ {i = 1, m = 1} ^ {N, M} \left(Q _ {\theta} \left(f \left(s _ {i}, \nu_ {i, m}\right), a _ {i}\right) - y _ {i}\right) ^ {2}. \tag {3}
$$

When both regularization methods are used,  $\nu_{i,m}$  and  $\nu_{i,k}^{\prime}$  are drawn independently.

# 4.2 PRACTICAL INSTANTIATION OF OPTIMALITY INVARIANT IMAGE TRANSFORMATION

A range of successful image augmentation techniques have been developed in computer vision (Ciregan et al., 2012; Ciresan et al., 2011; Simard et al., 2003; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2020). These apply transformations to the input image for which the task labels are invariant, e.g. for object recognition tasks, image flips and rotations do not alter the semantic label. However, tasks in RL differ significantly from those in vision and in many cases the reward would not be preserved by these transformations. We examine image transformations from Chen et al. (2020) (random shifts, random cutouts, horizontal/vertical flips, rotations and intensity shifts) in Appendix E and conclude that random shifts strike a good balance between simplicity and performance, we therefore limit our choice of transformation function  $f(\cdot)$  to random shifts.

We apply shifts to the images sampled from the replay buffer. For example, images from the DeepMind control suite used in our experiments are  $84 \times 84$ . We pad each side by 4 pixels (by repeating boundary pixels) and then select a random  $84 \times 84$  crop, yielding the original image shifted by  $\pm 4$  pixels. This procedure is repeated every time an image is sampled from the replay buffer.

# 4.3 OUR APPROACH: DATA-REGULARIZED Q (DRQ)

Our approach,  $\mathbf{DrQ}$ , is the union of the three separate regularization mechanisms introduced above:

1. transformations of the input image (Section 4.2).  
2. averaging the  $Q$  target over  $\mathbf{K}$  image transformations (Equation (1)).  
3. averaging the  $Q$  function itself over  $\mathbf{M}$  image transformations (Equation (3)).

Algorithm 1 details how they are incorporated into a generic pixel-based off-policy actor-critic algorithm. Note that if  $[\mathrm{K} = 1, \mathrm{M} = 1]$  then  $\mathbf{DrQ}$  reverts to image transformations alone, this makes applying  $\mathbf{DrQ}$  to any model-free RL algorithm straightforward.

For the experiments in this paper, we pair  $\mathbf{DrQ}$  with SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) and DQN (Mnih et al., 2013), popular model-free algorithms for control in continuous and discrete action spaces respectively. We select image shifts as the class of image transformations  $f$ , with  $\nu \pm 4$ , as explained in Section 4.2.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

# 5.1 ABLATION EXPERIMENT

Figure 1 shows the effect of image shift augmentation applied to three tasks from the DeepMind control suite (Tassa et al., 2018). Figure 1a shows unmodified SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) parameterized with different image encoders, taken from: NatureDQN (Mnih et al., 2013), Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2019), Impala (Espeholt et al., 2018), SAC-AE (Yarats et al., 2019), and D4PG (Barth-Maron et al., 2018). The encoders vary significantly in their architecture and capacity, with parameter counts ranging from 220k to 2.4M. None of these train satisfactorily, with performance decreasing for the larger capacity models. Figure 1b shows SAC with the application of our random shifts transformation of the input images (i.e. just Section 4.2, not Q augmentation also). The results for all encoder architectures improve dramatically, suggesting that our method is general and can assist many different encoder architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of applying image augmentation on the standard benchmarks for continuous control. Furthermore, Figure 2 shows the full  $\mathbf{DrQ}$ , with both image shifts and Q augmentation (Section 4.1), as well as ablated versions. Q augmentation provides additional consistent gain over image shift augmentation alone (full results are in Appendix F).

Figure 1: The performance of SAC trained from pixels on the DeepMind control suite using image encoder networks of different capacity (network architectures taken from recent RL algorithms, with parameter count indicated). (a): unmodified SAC. Task performance can be seen to get worse as the capacity of the encoder increases. For Walker Walk (right), all architectures provide mediocre performance, demonstrating the inability of SAC to train directly from pixels on harder problems. (b): SAC combined with image augmentation in the form of random shifts. The task performance is now similar for all architectures, regardless of their capacity, which suggests the generality of our method. There is also a clear performance improvement relative to (a), particularly for the more challenging Walker Walk task.

algorithm are kept fixed: the actor and critic neural networks are trained using the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with default parameters and a mini-batch size of  $512^{1}$ . For SAC, the soft target update rate  $\tau$  is 0.01, initial temperature is 0.1, and target network and the actor updates are made every 2 critic updates (as in Yarats et al. (2019)). We use the image encoder architecture from SAC-AE (Yarats et al., 2019) and follow their training procedure. The full set of parameters can be found in Appendix B. Following Henderson et al. (2018), the models are trained using 10 different seeds; for every seed the mean episode returns are computed every 10000 environment steps, averaging over 10 episodes. All figures plot the mean performance over the 10 seeds, together with  $\pm 1$  standard deviation shading. We compare our  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$  approach to leading model-free and model-based approaches: PlaNet (Hafner et al., 2018), SAC-AE (Yarats et al., 2019), SLAC (Lee et al., 2019), CURL (Srinivas et al., 2020) and Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2019). The comparisons use the results provided by the authors of the corresponding papers.

PlaNet Benchmark (Hafner et al., 2018) consists of six challenging control tasks from (Tassa et al., 2018) with different traits. The benchmark specifies a different action-repeat hyper-parameter for each of the six tasks $^{2}$ . Following common practice (Hafner et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Yarats et al., 2019; Mnih et al., 2013), we report the performance using true environment steps, thus are invariant to the action-repeat hyper-parameter. Aside from action-repeat, all other hyper-parameters of our algorithm are fixed across the six tasks, using the values previously detailed.

Figure 3 compares  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$ $[\mathrm{K} = 2,\mathrm{M} = 2]$  to PlaNet (Hafner et al., 2018), SAC-AE (Yarats et al., 2019), CURL (Srinivas et al., 2020), SLAC (Lee et al., 2019), and an upper bound performance provided by SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) that directly learns from internal states. We use the version of SLAC that performs one gradient update per an environment step to ensure a fair comparison to other approaches.  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$  achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark on all the tasks, despite being much simpler than other methods. Furthermore, since  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$  does not learn a model (Hafner et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019) or any auxiliary tasks (Srinivas et al., 2020), the wall clock time also compares favorably to the other methods.

In Table 1 we also compare performance given at a fixed number of environment interactions (e.g.  $100\mathrm{k}$  and  $500\mathrm{k}$ ). Furthermore, in Appendix G we demonstrate that  $\mathbf{DrQ}$  is robust to significant changes in hyper-parameter settings.

Dreamer Benchmark is a more extensive testbed that was introduced in Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2019), featuring a diverse set of tasks from the DeepMind control suite. Tasks involving sparse reward were excluded (e.g. Acrobot and Quadruped) since they require modification of SAC to incorporate multi-step returns (Barth-Maron et al., 2018), which is beyond the scope of this work. We evaluate on the remaining 15 tasks, fixing the action-repeat hyper-parameter to 2 as in Hafner et al. (2019).

We compare  $\mathbf{DrQ}$ $[\mathrm{K} = 2,\mathrm{M} = 2]$  to Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2019) and the upper-bound performance of SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) from states<sup>3</sup>. Again, we keep all the hyper-parameters of our algorithm fixed across all the tasks. In Figure 4,  $\mathbf{DrQ}$  demonstrates the state-of-the-art results by collectively outperforming Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2019), although Dreamer is superior on 3 of the 15 tasks

Figure 3: The PlaNet benchmark. Our algorithm  $(\mathbf{DrQ}[\mathrm{K} = 2,\mathrm{M} = 2])$  outperforms the other methods and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, on several tasks  $\mathbf{DrQ}$  is able to match the upper-bound performance of SAC trained directly on internal state, rather than images. Finally, our algorithm not only shows improved sample-efficiency relative to other approaches, but is also faster in terms of wall clock time.

Table 1: The PlaNet benchmark at 100k and 500k environment steps. Our method (DrQ [K=2,M=2]) outperforms other approaches in both the data-efficient (100k) and asymptotic performance (500k) regimes. Random shifts only version (e.g. DrQ [K=1,M=1]) has a competitive performance but is consistently inferior to DrQ [K=2,M=2], particularly for 100k steps. We emphasize, that both versions of DrQ use exactly the same number of interactions with both the environment and replay buffer. Note that DrQ [K=1,M=1] is almost identical to RAD (Laskin et al., 2020), modulo some hyper-parameter differences.

# 5.3 ATARI 100K EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$ $[\mathrm{K} = 1,\mathrm{M} = 1]$  on the Atari  $100\mathrm{k}$  benchmark (Kaiser et al., 2019) - a sample-constrained evaluation for discrete control algorithms. The underlying RL approach to which  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$  is applied is a DQN, combined with double Q-learning (van Hasselt et al., 2015), n-step returns (Mnih et al., 2016), andueling critic architecture (Wang et al., 2015).As per common practice (Kaiser et al., 2019; van Hasselt et al., 2019a), we evaluate our agent for  $125\mathrm{k}$  environment steps at the end of training and average its performance over 5 random seeds. Figure 5 shows the median human-normalized episode returns performance (as in Mnih et al. (2013)) of the underlying model, which we refer to as Efficient DQN, in pink. When  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$  is added there is a significant increase in performance (cyan), surpassing OTRainbow (Kielak, 2020) and Data Efficient Rainbow (van Hasselt et al., 2019a).  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$  is also superior to CURL (Srinivas et al., 2020) that uses an auxiliary loss built on top of a hybrid between OTRainbow and Efficient rainbow.  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$  combined with Efficient DQN thus achieves

state-of-the-art performance, despite being significantly simpler than the other approaches. The experimental setup and full results are detailed in Appendix C and Appendix D respectively.

Figure 5: The Atari 100k benchmark. Compared to a set of leading baselines, our method (DrQ  $[K = 1,M = 1]$ , combined with Efficient DQN) achieves the state-of-the-art performance, despite being considerably simpler. Note the large improvement that results from adding DrQ to Efficient DQN (pink vs cyan). By contrast, the gains from CURL, that utilizes tricks from both Data Efficient Rainbow and OTRainbow, are more modest over the underlying RL methods.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We have introduced a regularization technique, based on image shifts and Q-function augmentation, that significantly improves the performance of model-free RL algorithms trained directly from images. In contrast to the concurrent work of Laskin et al. (2020), which is a special case of  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$ , our method exploits the MDP structure of the problem, demonstrating gains over image augmentations alone. Our method is easy to implement and adds a negligible computational burden. We compared our method to state-of-the-art approaches on the DeepMind control suite, outperforming them on the majority of tasks and closing the gap with state-based training. On the Atari 100k benchmark  $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{Q}$  outperforms other SOTA methods in the median metric. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convincing demonstration of the utility of data augmentation on these standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the method to be robust to the choice of hyper-parameters.
