# ABSTRACT

The long runtime of high-fidelity partial differential equation (PDE) solvers makes them unsuitable for time-critical applications. We propose to accelerate PDE solvers using reduced-order modeling (ROM). Whereas prior ROM approaches reduce the dimensionality of discretized vector fields, our continuous reduced-order modeling (CROM) approach builds a smooth, low-dimensional manifold of the continuous vector fields themselves, not their discretization. We represent this reduced manifold using continuously differentiable neural fields, which may train on any and all available numerical solutions of the continuous system, even when they are obtained using diverse methods or discretizations. We validate our approach on an extensive range of PDEs with training data from voxel grids, meshes, and point clouds. Compared to prior discretization-dependent ROM methods, such as linear subspace proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and nonlinear manifold neural-network-based autoencoders, CROM features higher accuracy, lower memory consumption, dynamically adaptive resolutions, and applicability to any discretization. For equal latent space dimension, CROM exhibits  $79 \times$  and  $49 \times$  better accuracy, and  $39 \times$  and  $132 \times$  smaller memory footprint, than POD and autoencoder methods, respectively. Experiments demonstrate  $109 \times$  and  $89 \times$  wall-clock speedups over unreduced models on CPUs and GPUs, respectively.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Many scientific and engineering models are posed as partial differential equations (PDEs) of the form

$$
\mathcal {F} (\boldsymbol {f}, \nabla \boldsymbol {f}, \nabla^ {2} \boldsymbol {f}, \dots , \dot {\boldsymbol {f}}, \ddot {\boldsymbol {f}}, \dots) = \boldsymbol {0}, \quad \boldsymbol {f} (\boldsymbol {x}, t): \Omega \times \mathcal {T} \rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^ {d}, \tag {1}
$$

subject to initial and boundary conditions. Here  $\pmb{f}$  is a spatiotemporal dependent, multidimensional continuous vector field, such as temperature, velocity, or displacement;  $\nabla$  and  $(\cdot)$  are the spatial and temporal gradients;  $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^m$  and  $\mathcal{T} \subset \mathbb{R}$  are the spatial and temporal domains, respectively.

We may solve for  $\pmb{f}$  by discretizing in space,  $\pmb{f}(\pmb{x}, t) \approx \pmb{f}_P(\pmb{x}, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{P} \pmb{a}^i(t) N^i(\pmb{x})$ , transforming the continuous spatial representation to a  $(P \cdot d)$ -dimensional vector whose coefficients  $\pmb{a}^i(t) : \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}^d$  and the corresponding basis functions  $N^i(\pmb{x}) : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$  (e.g., polynomial basis, fourier basis) approximate the continuous solution. For instance, if  $N^i$  is the linear finite element basis, the coefficients  $\pmb{a}^i(t) = \pmb{f}(\pmb{x}^i, t)$  are field values at spatial samples  $\pmb{x}^i$  (Hughes, 2012).

After introducing temporal samples  $\{t_n\}_{n = 0}^T$ , we temporally evolve the solution by solving for  $P$  unknowns  $\{\pmb {a}^i (t_{n + 1})\}$  given the previous state  $\{\pmb {a}^i (t_n)\}$ . Unfortunately, when  $P$  is large, processing and memory costs of these full-order solves become intractable. To alleviate this computational burden, prior model reduction techniques (Berkooz et al., 1993; Willcox & Peraire, 2002; Benner et al., 2015) construct a low-dimensional manifold  $\pmb{g}_P:\mathbb{R}^r\mapsto \mathbb{R}^{Pd}$ , with  $r\ll Pd$ , such that every latent space vector  $\pmb {q}(t)\in \mathbb{R}^r$  maps to a discrete field  $\pmb {g}_P(\pmb {q})\mapsto (\pmb {a}^1,\dots ,\pmb {a}^P)^T$ . For instance, for linear finite elements (Barbič & James, 2005),  $\pmb {g}_P(\pmb {q})\mapsto \left(\pmb {f}(\pmb{x}^1,t),\dots \pmb {f}(\pmb{x}^P,t)\right)^T$ , as depicted in Figure 1a. ROM saves computation because it requires evolving only  $r\ll Pd$  latent space variables. $^1$

Figure 1: Model reduction solves PDEs via temporal evolution of the low-dimensional latent space vector  $\pmb{q}(t)$ . (a) Prior work assumes that the low-dimensional representation  $\pmb{g}_P$  is built for the already-discretized vector field; (b) our approach constructs the low-dimensional manifold  $\pmb{g}$  directly for the continuous vector field itself. In this case, the vector field  $\pmb{f}$  represents the twisting material governed by the elastodynamics equation.

Since existing ROM approaches apply to already-discretized fields, model training and PDE solving are tied to the dimension and discretization type of the training data, causing key limitations:

Discretization dependence. If we alter the training simulation resolution  $(P)$  or the discretization types (e.g., meshes to point clouds), we must also alter the architecture and numbers of parameters.

Memory scaling. Memory footprint grows with discretization resolution  $P$ .

Fixed discretization. We cannot dynamically adapt spatial resolution  $P$ , discretization type, or basis function  $N^i$  during latent-space-PDE solves, e.g., dynamic remeshing (Peraire et al., 1987).

Altogether these problems arise because the architecture of  $g_{P}(q)$  is tied to the discretization  $(a^{1},\ldots ,a^{P})^{T}$ .

Introducing a discretization-independent architecture In an alternative point of departure, we train a low-dimensional manifold  $g(\pmb{x}, \pmb{q}) \approx f(\pmb{x}, t)$  to approximate the continuous field itself, not its discretization (see Figure 1b). Note that the domain and co-domain of  $g$  are continuous domains: they do not depend on the choice of discretization(s) used at any stage of the process, i.e., during preparation of training data, nor during latent-space-PDE solving. In this sense, the manifold architecture is discretization independent. In our implementation,  $g$  is embodied as an implicit neural representation (Park et al., 2019; Chen & Zhang, 2019; Mescheder et al., 2019), also known as a neural field, yielding a smooth and analytically-differentiable manifold. This representation's memory footprint depends on the complexity of fields produced by the PDE, not the discretization resolution.

After training, we evolve the latent variables, as governed by the PDE, for previously-unexplored parameters. Unlike approaches that discard the PDE after training, we evaluate the original PDE at a small number of domain points at every time integration step. We validate our approach on classic PDEs with discretized data from voxels, meshes, and point clouds. In comparison to the full-order model, our approach reduces the number of spatial degrees of freedom, memory, and computational cost. In comparison to prior linear and nonlinear discretization-dependent model reduction methods, our method exhibits higher accuracy and consumes less memory. To highlight another benefit of being discretization-agnostic, we demonstrate an elasticity simulation that adapts mesh resolution.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Reduced-Order Modeling for PDEs. Early works on identifying a low-dimensional latent space focused on linear methods (Berkooz et al., 1993; Holmes et al., 2012), e.g., proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) or principal component analysis (PCA). Recent nonlinear manifolds (Fulton et al., 2019; Lee & Carlberg, 2020), often constructed via autoencoder neural networks, have been shown to significantly outperform their linear counterparts on slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width

problems (Peherstorfer, 2022). Most of these prior works exclusively focus on building a latent space for the already-discretized vector fields. Chen et al. (2021); Pan et al. (2022) and our work attempt to construct the latent space for the continuous vectors themselves. However, Chen et al. (2021)'s treatment specializes in the material point method (discretization) and elasticity (PDE); our general treatment is both discretization and PDE agnostic. Likewise, Pan et al. (2022) trains a discretization-agnostic latent space for PDE data; we further solve the PDEs in the reduced space via rapid latent space traversal. Additional references to ROM are listed in Appendix A.

Implicit neural representations use (fully-connected) neural networks to represent arbitrary vector fields. While the Euclidean space spatial coordinates always form part of the input to the network, it is also common to have a latent space vector to complement the rest of the input. Different latent space vectors correspond to different states of the continuous vector field (see Figure 1b), e.g. different geometries (Park et al., 2019; Chen & Zhang, 2019; Mescheder et al., 2019) or different radiance fields (Mildenhall et al., 2020). A key contribution of our work is nonlinearly traversing the latent space of neural representations under an explicit PDE constraint.

Machine learning (ML) for PDEs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) (Raissi et al., 2019; Sitzmann et al., 2020b) demonstrate that PDEs can be accurately solved via neural representations. Notably, PINN enables prediction and discovery from incomplete models and incomplete data (Karniadakis et al., 2021). However, the degrees of freedom involved in their approaches are still  $Pd$ , and the underlying gradient-descent-based solver is often computationally more expensive than traditional solvers (see Table 1 by Zehnder et al. (2021)). By contrast, our goal is building a computationally more efficient solution that solves for only  $r$  degrees of freedom ( $r \ll Pd$ ). In fact, our approach can be viewed as an extension of PINN for model reduction. Setting the latent space vector  $\pmb{q}(t)$  in our formulation (see Figure 1b) to the time variable  $t$  recovers the exact formulation of PINN. In addition to PINN, Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. (2020) show graph neural network (GNN) architectures are also capable of learning PDEs. Yet, like PINNs, GNNs also do not offer dimension reduction.

# 3 METHOD:OVERVIEW AND MANIFOLD CONSTRUCTION

Overview Our goal is to efficiently obtain the solution of Equation (1). We begin by constructing a low dimensional manifold (see below), after which we solve PDEs by time-integrating the dynamics of the manifold's latent space vector (see Section 4). As we demonstrate in examples from various scientific disciplines (see Section 5), this general method is applicable regardless of the discretization of the training data (e.g., voxel grids, meshes, point clouds) or the discretization deemed most useful for evaluating the gradients (e.g., physical forces) when solving PDEs on the constructed manifold.

Low-dimensional Manifold Construction As depicted in Figure 1b, we seek a manifold  $g(\pmb{x}, \pmb{q})$ ,

$$
\boldsymbol {g} (\boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {q} (t; \boldsymbol {\mu})) \approx \boldsymbol {f} (\boldsymbol {x}, t; \boldsymbol {\mu}), \quad \forall \boldsymbol {x} \in \Omega , \quad \forall t \in \mathcal {T}, \quad \forall \boldsymbol {\mu} \in \mathcal {D}, \tag {2}
$$

that well approximates the continuous field  $f(\pmb{x}, t; \pmb{\mu})$  throughout the spatiotemporal domain  $\Omega \times \mathcal{T}$ , and for a workable range of problem parameters  $\pmb{\mu} \in \mathcal{D}$ . For ease of exposition, we omit the dependencies of  $\pmb{q}$  and  $\pmb{f}$  on the problem parameters  $\pmb{\mu}$ . Here  $\mathcal{D}$  is an arbitrary parameter space (e.g., material properties, external forces, user settings). For scenarios that do not feature trivial parameterizations, e.g., external force via crowd-sourcing (Barbič & James, 2005),  $\mathcal{D}$  can also be implicitly defined.

What distinguishes our approach from typical model reduction is that  $\pmb{g}$  takes the position  $\pmb{x} \in \Omega$  as an input. Thus, unlike prior approaches that infer only discrete coefficients, our approach infers field values at arbitrary domain positions  $\pmb{x}$ .

We parameterize  $g$  with a neural network  $g_{\theta_g}$  whose weights  $\theta_g$  satisfy the minimization problem

$$
\min  _ {\theta_ {g}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {P} \sum_ {n = 0} ^ {T} \sum_ {\boldsymbol {\mu} \in \mathcal {D} _ {\text {t r a i n}}} \| \boldsymbol {g} _ {\theta_ {g}} \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {i}, \boldsymbol {q} \left(t _ {n}\right)\right) - \boldsymbol {f} \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {i}, t _ {n}\right) \| _ {2} ^ {2}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{train}} \subset \mathcal{D}$  is the training set, and  $\pmb{q}(t_n)$  is the latent space vector shared among all spatial samples. This objective aims to reproduce all the field values present in the training data, generated

![](images/dddf7f8037c2f4f8aa0246e3637460d55c3b247540e0c45cf60bc1e292f4497d.jpg)  
Figure 2: Constructing the low-dimensional manifold as a neural network trained via supervised learning. We pass each snapshot (time step) from the training dataset into an encoder to obtain a latent space vector  $\mathbf{q}$ . We then concatenate  $\mathbf{q}$  with the spatial coordinates and pass that into the low-dimensional manifold with the goal of reconstructing  $\mathbf{f}$  for each individual spatial sample. The same  $\mathbf{q}$  is shared among all spatial samples in this time step.

via full-order PDE solutions. Notably, our approach imposes no limit on the discretization strategy of the PDE solver. For instance, this framework is applicable to training data from both finite difference methods and finite element methods as well as both voxel grids and meshes.

There are commonly two approaches to define the latent space vector  $\pmb{q}$ : the auto-decoder approach (Park et al., 2019) that trains  $\pmb{q}$  along with  $g_{\theta_g}$  and the encoder approach (Chen & Zhang, 2019; Mescheder et al., 2019) that trains a separate network to output  $\pmb{q}$ . While both approaches work for our application, we adopt the latter.

The encoder network  $e_{\theta_e}$  with weights  $\theta_e$  takes an input vector constructed by concatenating all the discrete degrees of freedom from the training data and outputs a latent space vector (see Figure 2):

$$
e _ {\theta_ {e}} (\vec {f} (t)) = \boldsymbol {q} (t), \quad \text {w h e r e} \vec {f} (t) = \left(\boldsymbol {f} \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {1}, t\right), \dots \boldsymbol {f} \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {i}, t\right), \dots \boldsymbol {f} \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {P}, t\right)\right) ^ {T}.
$$

We emphasize that this discretization-dependent encoder (Xie et al., 2021) is merely a tool for training the smoothly varying latent space. The implicit neural representation  $\pmb{g}_{\theta_g}$  remains a discretization-agnostic architecture.

Adding the encoder, Equation (3) now becomes

$$
\min  _ {\theta_ {g}, \theta_ {e}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {P} \sum_ {n = 0} ^ {T} \sum_ {\boldsymbol {\mu} \in \mathcal {D} _ {\text {t r a i n}}} \| \boldsymbol {g} _ {\theta_ {g}} \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {i}, \boldsymbol {e} _ {\theta_ {e}} (\vec {\boldsymbol {f}} (t _ {n}))\right) - \boldsymbol {f} \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {i}, t _ {n}\right) \| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {4}
$$

Figure 2 illustrates the training pipeline. Please refer to Appendix D for network and training details and Appendix F for hyperparameter selection.

# 4 METHOD:LATENTSPACEDYNAMICS

After the manifold is constructed, we compute latent space dynamics  $(\pmb{q}_n \mapsto \pmb{q}_{n+1})$  in three steps (see Figure 3 and appendix Q): (1) network inference, (2) PDE time-stepping, and (3) network inversion. The neural network strictly serves as a kinematic spatial representation in the maps from and to the latent space (steps 1 and 3, respectively). The time integration (step 2) itself uses the original PDE, not a neural network approximation thereof. The ROM community has demonstrated that these three steps can yield strong long-time stability even on stiff and chaotic dynamical systems (Carlberg et al., 2013; 2017). Appendices O and P demonstrate smooth latent space trajectories and empirical stability analysis using this approach.

Figure 3: Latent space dynamics: temporally evolve from one latent space vector to another, governed by the PDE. The entire pipeline only involves degrees of freedom from a small spatial subset  $\mathcal{M}$ , where  $|\mathcal{M}| \ll P$ .

Commonly shared among all three steps are "integration samples", a finite set of spatial domain points  $\mathcal{M} := \{\pmb{y}^j \in \Omega \mid 1 \leq j \leq |\mathcal{M}|\}$  chosen at the user's discretion (see Section 4.4). These samples need not coincide with the previously mentioned full-order finite element discretization samples  $\{\pmb{x}^i\}_{i=1}^P$ .

# 4.1 STEP 1: NETWORK INFERENCE

We first aim to gather all the full-space spatiotemporal information  $(\forall \pmb{y} \in \mathcal{M})$  necessary for PDE time integration. The function value  $\pmb{f}$  itself can be evaluated via inferencing of the neural network  $\pmb{f}(\pmb{y}, t_n) = \pmb{g}_{\theta_g}(\pmb{y}, \pmb{q}_n)$ . The spatial and temporal gradients are computed either by differentiating the network,  $\nabla f(\pmb{y}, t_n) = \nabla_{\pmb{y}} g_{\theta_g}$  and  $\dot{\pmb{f}}(\pmb{y}, t_n) = \frac{\partial g_{\theta_g}}{\partial \pmb{q}} \dot{\pmb{q}}_n$ , respectively, or by numerical approximation. Higher-order gradients may be generalized in a similar manner. Further details on gradient computation are listed in Appendix E.

# 4.2 STEP 2: PDE TIME-STEPPING

We now evolve time from  $t_n$  to  $t_{n+1}$ . Unlike end-to-end learning-based latent space dynamics methods (Lusch et al., 2018), we evaluate time derivatives using the exact PDE (1), not a learned surrogate. At each integration point  $\pmb{y}$ , we evaluate the temporal derivative by solving the PDE (1) for  $\pmb{f}_{n+1}(\pmb{y})$ :

$$
\mathcal {F} \left(\boldsymbol {f} _ {n}, \nabla \boldsymbol {f} _ {n}, \dots , \dot {\boldsymbol {f}} _ {n + 1}, \dots\right) = \boldsymbol {0}. \tag {5}
$$

We evolve the configuration to time  $t_{n+1} = t_n + \Delta t$  using the chosen explicit time integration method  $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{F}}$  subject to given boundary conditions, e.g., Runge-Kutta methods (Dormand & Prince, 1980):

$$
\boldsymbol {f} _ {n + 1} = \mathcal {I} _ {\boldsymbol {\mathcal {F}}} (\Delta t, \boldsymbol {f} _ {n}, \dot {\boldsymbol {f}} _ {n + 1}, \dots) \quad \forall \boldsymbol {y} \in \mathcal {M}. \tag {6}
$$

While this work focuses on explicit time integration, we can also extend the framework for implicit time integration (Carlberg et al., 2017).

# 4.3 STEP 3: NETWORK INVERSION

We project back onto the reduced manifold by finding the corresponding input  $\mathbf{q}_{n+1}$  that best matches the evolved configuration  $\mathbf{f}_{n+1}$  in a least-squares sense: (Quarteroni et al., 2014)

$$
\min  _ {\boldsymbol {q} _ {n + 1} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {r}} \sum_ {\boldsymbol {y} \in \mathcal {M}} \| \boldsymbol {g} _ {\theta_ {g}} (\boldsymbol {y}, \boldsymbol {q} _ {n + 1}) - \boldsymbol {f} (\boldsymbol {y}, t _ {n + 1}) \| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {7}
$$

The objective is similar to the training loss found in Equation (3), but with two dimensions significantly reduced: the dimension of the unknown  $\mathbf{q}_{n + 1}$ , and the summation bound  $|\mathcal{M}|$ . Consequently, instead of using a stochastic gradient descent type of method, such as the auto-decoder scheme by Park et al. (2019), we achieve rapid inversion using the Gauss-Newton algorithm (Nocedal & Wright, 2006) with conditionally quadratic convergence. Further details are listed in Appendix C.

Figure 4: Thermodynamics. Left: integration samples  $(\mathcal{M})$ . Greedily selecting the samples (blue) allows us to use significantly fewer degrees of freedom than the full-order simulation (purple) while getting a much higher accuracy than naive uniform sampling (red). The depicted field is temperature governed by the heat equation after 100 time steps. Right: as dictated by the PDE, the reduced system is conservative: total energy (stored thermal energy plus cumulative flux at boundary) is conserved.

# 4.4 SPATIAL SAMPLE REDUCTION

The least squares formulation from Equation (7) is well-posed if  $r \leq d|\mathcal{M}|$ . Since the low-dimensional manifold construction guarantees that  $r \ll Pd$ , we choose  $\frac{r}{d} \leq |\mathcal{M}| \ll P$ . To obtain the next-time step  $f(\pmb{y}, t_{n+1}), \forall \pmb{y} \in \mathcal{M}$  necessary for the least squares solves, we only require PDE updates (Section 4.2) and spatiotemporal data (Section 4.1) at these  $|\mathcal{M}|$  samples. As such, the entire latent space dynamics framework (Figure 3) requires only  $|\mathcal{M}|$  samples, compared to the full-order solver's  $P$  samples. Hyper-reduction approaches like this have captured a wide range of real-world scenarios, including massive elasticity deformations (Fulton et al., 2019) and large turbulent flows (Grimberg et al., 2021). Unlike our discretization-independent approach, prior methods only support hyper-reduction samples that coincide with the full-order discretization.

A naive selection of the integration samples can lead to inaccurate latent space dynamics, even if  $|\mathcal{M}| \geq \frac{r}{d}$ ; refer to Figure 4 for the failure case of uniform sampling. As noted in the hyper-reduction literature, stochastic sampling can eliminate such errors (Carlberg, 2011). To better control hyperreduction error, we draw inspirations from the cubature approach by An et al. (2008) and propose a greedy algorithm that augments the sample set to meet a target residual (see Appendix B). Results of our sampling approach are shown in Figures 4, 8 and 20.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

We analyze the proposed framework on classic PDEs, with training data produced using a variety of discretizations (voxel grids, meshes, and point clouds). Unless otherwise noted, for each PDE, we delineate a testing set where  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{test}} \subset \mathcal{D}$  with  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{train}} \cap \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{test}} = \emptyset$ . We construct the manifold (Section 3) with data from  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{train}}$ , and then validate the latent space dynamics (Section 4) on  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{test}}$ . We compare our approach with prior discretization-dependent ROM methods, including POD (Berkooz et al., 1993; Holmes et al., 2012) and neural-network-based autoencoder approaches (Fulton et al., 2019; Lee & Carlberg, 2020; Shen et al., 2021). Additional implementation and reproducibility details are listed from Appendix G to Appendix L. Experiment statistics are summarized in Table 1. The temporal evolutions of the PDEs are best illustrated via the supplementary video.

Thermodynamics,  $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \nu(x)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0$ . Temperature  $u$  is governed by a one-dimensional heat equation.  $\nu$  describes the spatially-varying diffusion speed. Figure 4 displays our approach's ability to use very few integration samples and to capture conservation of energy.

Image Processing,  $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \nu(\pmb{x}) \nabla^2 u = 0$ . We model image blurring with the 2D diffusion equation (Perona & Malik, 1990). Figure 5 shows that under the same latent space dimension ( $r = 3$ ), our method is more accurate than POD (Berkooz et al., 1993; Holmes et al., 2012), both visually and quantitatively. With its manifold architecture independent of pixel count, CROM uses an order of magnitude less memory than POD (see Figure 5c).

Transport dominated systems. Next, we examine two transport-dominated slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-widths problems, the Advection Equation and Burgers' Equation, where classic model reduction techniques often struggle (Peherstorfer, 2022):

![](images/41b5c657ea225ff0ef1ce72f2412d6cb65cc561f154cd414a7def0d32fa0d8f4.jpg)  
Figure 5: Image processing: comparison with POD. Ground truth solution uses  $P = 65, 536$  pixels. (a) Visually, our approach better captures the sharp initial state and the smoothed final state than POD. (b) Quantitatively, CROM obtains a higher PSNR than POD ( $\uparrow$  the higher the better). (c) Our approach also uses an order-of-magnitude less memory than POD ( $\downarrow$  the lower the better). Both POD and our approach use the same latent space dimension ( $r = 3$ ).

![](images/5c5047ca41b47f93d084584fcc935d331ffe91960a8f64e09134d36b150c3fb7.jpg)  
Figure 6: Breaking the Kolmogorov barrier: CROM outperforms POD and convolutional autoencoders (Lee & Carlberg, 2020) in tracking both the Advection and Burgers' trajectories. For both cases, we use the intrinsic solution-manifold dimension (Lee & Carlberg, 2020), the lower bound of  $r$ , as the latent space dimension  $r$ . To isolate the source of error, no hyper-reduction method is applied.

Advection Equation,  $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + (a \cdot \nabla)u = 0$ . Here  $u$  is the advected quantity and  $a$  is the advection velocity. Figure 6a depicts CROM's favorable trajectory tracking relative to both POD and the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) of Lee & Carlberg (2020), for equal latent space dimension (also see Figure 21).

Burgers' Equation,  $\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial 0.5w^2}{\partial x} = 0.02e^{\mu_Dx}$ . Figure 6b shows that CROM more accurately captures the nonlinear dynamics than both POD and CAE (also see Figure 22). Additionally, CROM also uses  $12\times$  less memory than CAE (see Figure 26). These accuracy and memory advantages are consistent with the implicit neural representation literature (Chen & Zhang, 2019).

Whereas CAE is applicable only to voxel grid data, CROM is applicable to data from any discretization, as highlighted by these tetrahedral mesh and point cloud data examples.

Solid Mechanics,  $\rho_0\ddot{\phi} = \nabla \cdot P(\nabla \phi) + \rho_0B$ . We solve the second-order elastodynamics equation for the deformation map  $\phi$  of soft bodies, where  $\rho_0$  is the initial density,  $P$  is the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress, and  $B$  is the body force density (see Figures 7 to 10).

Adaptive resolution. Prior ROM methods (see Figure 1a) fix the discretization at onset, precluding the dynamic adaptivity approaches that benefit problems with evolving complexity. When modeling a falling block (see Figure 7), prior ROM methods must begin with a high-resolution mesh, despite that the high-resolution is required only during contact (Figure 7a and b). Our discretization-independent representation allows the time integrator to freely adapt the spatial discretization throughout the dynamic evolution. For instance, we can employ a coarse mesh ( $P = 8$  vertices) to economize computation during the rigid falling phase (Figure 7c), and a high-resolution mesh ( $P = 2$ , 065) to capture details during contact (Figure 7c), yielding  $35 \times -48 \times$  wall-clock speedups over fixed discretization ROM methods. To ensure generalizability of the comparison, the timing is done strictly for the PDE time-stepping stage (Step 2). Prior ROM architectures (i.e., both POD and autoencoder approaches) share the same PDE time-stepping routine.

Memory footprint. Most prior ROM approaches are discretization-dependent. As discretization resolution  $(P)$  increases, so does memory consumption for  $g$ . By contrast, our discretization-

Figure 7: Adaptive discretization in solid mechanics. A falling deformable body impacts two static objects. (a and b) Prior approaches (Barbič & James, 2005; Fulton et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2021) only support reduced-order dynamics with fixed discretizations, forcing a tough choice between accuracy and computational cost; (c) our approach allows dynamic mesh adaptivity to balance accuracy and cost as problem difficulty varies over time. (d) Our resolution-independent encoding of the deformation map allows us to visualize the field using any method (e.g., a high resolution mesh) without regard to the computational mesh. CROM's speedup over prior discretization-dependent ROM methods is observed for 1-32 threads, and emphasized in the case of limited computation resources. To ensure representativeness of prior ROM architectures, we report timing strictly for the PDE-time-stepping stage (Step 2), which is shared among all prior ROM architectures.

Figure 8: Solid mechanics (a) The ground truth is generated via the full-order PDE solver. (b) Our approach is  $41 - 109 \times$  faster than the ground truth while capturing detailed shearing and volume-preserving behaviors ( $1.46\%$  error). (c) Prior approach (Barbic, 2012) of the same latent space dimension consumes  $26 \times$  more memory while suffering from volume-gain artifacts ( $5.76\%$  error). (d) These simulations adopt a tetrahedral discretization (d, pink mesh,  $P = 66, 608$ ). Instead of using the expensive high-resolution mesh, our approach computes dynamics using very few integration samples (d, colorful spheres,  $|\mathcal{M}| = 40$ ). (e) Naive down-resolution of the ground truth simulation yields a similar runtime but leads to significantly worse quality. (f) After training, our model can capture a wide range of material properties. (g) The same low-dimensional manifold architecture (different network weights) can also be used for model-reducing point-cloud based simulation (reproduced from the work by (Chen et al., 2021)). The speedup plot on the right demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach on diverse computing platforms. Disclaimer: the authors do not support animal cruelty.

Figure 9: Our approach uses significantly less memory and simultaneously yields higher accuracy than POD and the autoencoder-based ROM methods of Fulton et al. (2019) and Shen et al. (2021) for the solid mechanics experiment depicted in Figure 8. For example, with  $r = 3$ , our approach uses  $39 \times$  and  $132 \times$  less memory, while simultaneously offering  $79 \times$  and  $49 \times$  more accuracy, compared to POD and the autoencoder approach of Fulton et al. (2019), respectively.

Figure 10: CROM agrees well with the ground truth simulation while consuming far less memory than prior discretization-dependent ROM approaches, including POD (Barbič, 2012) and neural-network-based autoencoder approaches (Fulton et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2021).

Autoencoder [Shen et al. 2021]

independent architecture does not "see" the parameter  $P$  and in practice memory footprint does not scale with  $P$ . Rather, as with all neural fields (Xie et al., 2021), memory grows with the intrinsic complexity of the presented training data.

Figure 9 compares memory footprint and reconstruction error for CROM, POD (Barbič, 2012), and neural-network-based autoencoder approaches (Fulton et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2021), as a function of latent space dimension; Figure 8 depicts the corresponding large deformation simulations. Figure 10 compares CROM's memory and accuracy on another large deformation example. For these examples, CROM offers simultaneously lower memory consumption and reconstruction error. Furthermore, due to hyper-reduction(from  $P = 66$ , 608 to  $|\mathcal{M}| = 40$ ), CROM also obtains a significant wall-clock speedup on CPUs, consumer GPUs, and data center GPUs over the unreduced model (see Figure 8).

Different discretizations, same architecture. Because CROM is not constructed for a fixed discretization, we can adopt an identical low-dimensional manifold architecture to model-reduce simulations of both tetrahedral meshes and point clouds (see Figure 8g). Moreover, even though these examples (Figures 7 and 8) leverage completely different meshes, they use the same network architecture. This opens the door for future work on transfer learning (Weiss et al., 2016) and weight sharing among various discretizations and PDEs.

Additional comparisons between CROM, previous ROM, and the full-order models are discussed in Appendices M and N.

# 6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

CROM is a model reduction framework for PDEs featuring a discretization-independent architecture. CROM disentangles the low-dimensional manifold from the discretization by reformulating the reduced manifold as a map accepting not only  $\pmb{q}$  but also  $\pmb{x}$  as an input. CROM outperforms discretization-dependent ROM approaches, such as POD and autoencoders, in terms of accuracy and memory consumption for equal latent space dimension, and in the ability to dynamically adapt the discretization during time integration.

While offering key advantages over prior ROM methods, CROM also inherits a limitation of ROM. It can only treat PDE solutions in the space spanned by the low-dimensional manifold (determined by the training data) and does not generalize to arbitrary unseen scenarios. Such a limitation is also commonly found among other implicit neural representation works (Xie et al., 2021). Future research may consider improving generalizability and data efficiency via meta-learning and integration of stronger priors (Sitzmann et al., 2020a).

Compared to end-to-end ML solutions to PDEs (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020), CROM employs the neural network strictly as a spatial representation (see Sections 4.1 and 4.3) for the kinematics and solves the PDE using classical PDE-integration numerical methods (see Section 4.2). As such, we believe CROM will open doors for more forthcoming hybrid ML-PDE solutions. As shown in our work, these solutions can retain the PDE's physical invariants (see Figure 4), allow for easy integration with existing PDE solvers (see Section 4.2), and obtain practical computational savings that can be directly employed in production (see Figure 8).
