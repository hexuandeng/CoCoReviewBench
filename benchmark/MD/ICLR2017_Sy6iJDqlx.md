# ABSTRACT

Transferring knowledge from prior source tasks in solving a new target task can be useful in several learning applications. The application of transfer poses two serious challenges which have not been adequately addressed. First, the agent should be able to avoid negative transfer, which happens when the transfer hampers or slows down the learning instead of helping it. Second, the agent should be able to selectively transfer, which is the ability to select and transfer from different and multiple source tasks for different parts of the state space of the target task. We propose A2T (Attend, Adapt and Transfer), an attentive deep architecture which adapts and transfers from these source tasks. Our model is generic enough to effect transfer of either policies or value functions. Empirical evaluations on different learning algorithms show that A2T is an effective architecture for transfer by being able to avoid negative transfer while transferring selectively from multiple source tasks in the same domain.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

One of the goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to build autonomous agents that can learn and adapt to new environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a key technique for achieving such adaptability. The goal of RL algorithms is to learn an optimal policy for choosing actions that maximises some notion of long term performance. Transferring knowledge gained from tasks solved earlier to solve a new target task can help, either in terms of speeding up the learning process or in terms of achieving a better solution, among other performance measures. When applied to RL, transfer could be accomplished in many ways (see Taylor & Stone (2009; 2011) for a very good survey of the field). One could use the value function from the source task as an initial estimate in the target task to cut down exploration [Sorg & Singh (2009)]. Alternatively one could use policies from the source task(s) in the target task. This can take one of two forms - (i) the derived policies can be used as initial exploratory trajectories [Atkeson & Schaal (1997); Niekum et al. (2013)] in the target task and (ii) the derived policy could be used to define macro actions which may then be used by the agent in solving the target task [Mannor et al. (2004); Brunskill & Li (2014)].

While transfer in RL has been much explored, there are two crucial issues that have not been adequately addressed in the literature. The first is negative transfer, which happens when the transfer results in a performance that is worse when compared to learning from scratch in the target task.

This severely limits the applicability of many transfer techniques to cases in which some measure of relatedness between source and target tasks can be guaranteed beforehand. This brings us to the second problem with transfer, which is the issue of identifying an appropriate source task from which to transfer. In some scenarios, different source tasks might be relevant and useful for different parts of the state space of the target task. As a real world analogy, consider multiple players (experts) who are good at different aspects of a game (say, tennis). For example, Player 1 is good at playing backhand shots while Player 2 is good at playing forehand shots. Suppose a new player (agent) wants to learn tennis by selectively learning from these two experts. We handle this in our architecture by allowing the agent to learn to pick and use solutions from multiple and different source tasks while solving a target task, for different parts of its state space. We call this selective transfer. Our agent can transfer knowledge from Player 1 for backhand shots and Player 2 for playing forehand shots. Further, lets consider that both the players are bad at playing drop shots. Apart from the source tasks, we maintain a base network that starts learning from scratch. The agent can pick and use its solution for parts of the state space of the target task, where transferring from source tasks result in a negative transfer and in those parts of the state space where none of the source task solutions are relevant, which handles the former problem of negative transfer. Here our agent can avoid transferring from both the players while learning to play drop shots and learn it using the base network. The architecture is trained such that the base network uses, not just the experience obtained through the usage of its solutions in the target task, but the overall experience got using the combined knowledge of the source tasks and itself. This enables the base network solutions to get closer to the behavior of the overall architecture (which uses the source task solutions as well). This makes it easier for the base network to assist the architecture to fine tune the useful source task solutions to suit the target task perfectly over time.

The key contribution in the architecture is a deep attention network, that decides which solutions to attend to for a given input state. The network learns solutions as a function of current state thereby aiding the agent in adopting different solutions for different parts of the state space in the target task.

To this end, we propose A2T: Attend, adapt and transfer, an attentive deep architecture for adaptive transfer, that avoids negative transfer while performing selective transfer from multiple source tasks in the same domain. As a real world scenario and a generalisation of the tennis example, consider any game, such as football and cricket. An agent that wants to learn these games can use A2T to transfer different useful skills from different players depending upon who is good at which aspect of the game. While learning a particular aspect of the game, they can now safely avoid transferring it from players who are bad at it. This architecture is generic enough to effect transfer of either action policies or action-value functions, as the case may be. We also adapt different algorithms in reinforcement learning as appropriate for the different settings and empirically demonstrate that the A2T is effective for transfer learning.

# 2 RELATED WORK

As mentioned earlier, transfer learning approaches could deal with transferring policies or value functions. For example, Banerjee & Stone (2007) describe a method for transferring value functions by constructing a Game tree. Similarly, Sorg & Singh (2009) use the value function from a source task as the initial estimate of the value function in the target task.

Another method to achieve transfer is to reuse policies derived in the source task(s) in the target task. Probabilistic Policy Reuse as discussed in Fernandez & Veloso (2006) maintains a library of policies and selects a policy based on a similarity metric, or a random policy, or a max-policy from the knowledge obtained. This is different from the proposed approach in that the proposed approach can transfer policies at the granularity of individual states which is not possible in policy-reuse rendering it unable to learn customized policy at that granularity. Atkeson & Schaal (1997); Niekum et al. (2013) evaluated the idea of having the transferred policy from the source tasks as explorative policies instead of having a random exploration policy. This provides better exploration behavior provided the tasks are similar. Talvitie & Singh (2007) try to find the promising policy from a set of candidate policies that are generated using different action mapping to a single solved task. In contrast, we make use of one or more source tasks to selectively transfer policies at the granularity of state. Apart from policy transfer and value transfer as discussed above, Ferguson & Mahadevan (2006) discuss representation transfer using Proto Value Functions.

The idea of negative and selective transfer have been discussed earlier in the literature. For example, Lazaric & Restelli (2011) address the issue of negative transfer in transferring samples for a related task in a multi-task setting. Konidaris et al. (2012) discuss the idea of exploiting shared common features across related tasks. They learn a shaping function that can be used in later tasks.

The two recent works that are very relevant to the proposed architecture are discussed in Parisotto et al. (2015) and Rusu et al. (2016). Parisotto et al. (2015) explore transfer learning in RL across Atari games by trying to learn a multi-task network over the source tasks available and directly fine-tune the learned multi-task network on the target task. However, fine-tuning as a transfer paradigm cannot address the issue of negative transfer which they do observe in many of their experiments. Rusu et al. (2016) try to address the negative transfer issue by proposing a sequential learning mechanism where the filters of the network being learned for an ongoing task are dependent through lateral connections on the lower level filters of the networks learned already for the previous tasks. The idea is to ensure that dependencies that characterize similarity across tasks could be learned through these lateral connections. Even though they do observe better transfer results than direct fine-tuning, they are still not able to avoid negative transfer in some of their experiments.

# 3 PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE

Let there be  $N$  source tasks and let  $K_{1}, K_{2}, \ldots, K_{N}$  be the solutions of these source tasks  $1, \ldots, N$  respectively. Let  $K_{T}$  be the solution that we learn in the target task  $T$ . Source tasks refer to tasks that we have already learnt to perform and target task refers to the task that we are interested in learning now. These solutions could be for example policies or state-action values. Here the source tasks should be in the same domain as the target task, having the same state and action spaces. We propose a setting where  $K_{T}$  is learned as a function of  $K_{1}, \ldots, K_{N}, K_{B}$ , where  $K_{B}$  is the solution of a base network which starts learning from scratch while acting on the target task. In this work, we use a convex combination of the solutions to obtain  $K_{T}$ .

$$
K _ {T} (s) = w _ {N + 1, s} K _ {B} (s) + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} w _ {i, s} K _ {i} (s) \tag {1}
$$

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N + 1} w _ {i, s} = 1, w _ {i, s} \in [ 0, 1 ] \tag {2}
$$

$w_{i,s}$  is the weight given to the  $i$ th solution at state  $s$ .

The agent uses  $K_{T}$  to act in the target task. Figure 1a shows the proposed architecture. While the source task solutions  $K_{1},\ldots ,K_{N}$  remain fixed, the base network solutions are learnt and hence  $K_{B}$  can change over time. There is a central network which learns the weights  $(w_{i,s},i\in 1,2,\dots ,N + 1)$ , given the input state  $s$ . We refer to this network as the attention network. The [0,1] weights determine the attention each solution gets allowing the agent to selectively accept or reject the different solutions, depending on the input state. We adopt a soft-attention mechanism whereby more than one weight can be non-zero [Bahdanau et al. (2014)] as opposed to a hard-attention mechanism [Mnih et al. (2014)] where we are forced to have only one non-zero weight.

$$
w _ {i, s} = \frac {\exp \left(e _ {i , s}\right)}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N + 1} \exp \left(e _ {j , s}\right)}, i \in \{1, 2, \dots , N + 1 \} \tag {3}
$$

$$
(e _ {1, s}, e _ {2, s}, \dots , e _ {N + 1, s}) = f (s; \theta_ {a}) \tag {4}
$$

Here,  $f(s; \theta_a)$  is a deep neural network (attention network), which could consist of convolution layers and fully connected layers depending on the representation of input. It is parametrised by  $\theta_a$  and takes as input a state  $s$  and outputs a vector of length  $N + 1$ , which gives the attention scores for the  $N + 1$  solutions at state  $s$ . Eq.(3) normalises this score to get the weights that follow Eq.(2).

If the  $i$ th source task solution is useful at state  $s$ , then  $w_{i,s}$  is set to a high value by the attention network. Working at the granularity of states allows the attention network to attend to different source tasks, for different parts of the state space of the target task, thus giving it the ability to

perform selective transfer. For parts of the state space in the target task, where the source task solutions cause negative transfer or where the source task solutions are not relevant, the attention network learns to give high weight to the base network solution (which can be learnt and improved), thus avoiding negative transfer.

Depending on the feedback obtained from the environment upon following  $K_{T}$ , the attention network's parameters  $\theta_{a}$  are updated to improve performance.

As mentioned earlier, the source task solutions,  $K_{1}, \ldots, K_{N}$  remain fixed. Updating these source task's parameters would cause a significant amount of unlearning in the source tasks solutions and result in a weaker transfer, which we observed empirically. This also enables the use of source task solutions, as long as we have the outputs alone, irrespective of how and where they come from.

Even though the agent follows  $K_{T}$ , we update the parameters of the base network that produces  $K_{B}$ , as if the action taken by the agent was based only on  $K_{B}$ . Due to this special way of updating  $K_{B}$ , apart from the experience got through the unique and individual contribution of  $K_{B}$  to  $K_{T}$  in parts of the state space where the source task solutions are not relevant,  $K_{B}$  also uses the valuable experience got by using  $K_{T}$  which uses the solutions of the source tasks as well.

This also means that, if there is a source task whose solution  $K_{j}$  is useful for the target task in some parts of its state space, then  $K_{B}$  tries to replicate  $K_{j}$  in those parts of the state space. In practise, the source task solutions though useful, might need to be modified to suit perfectly for the target task. The base network takes care of these modifications required to make the useful source task solutions perfect for the target task. The special way of training the base network assists the architecture in achieving this faster. Note that the agent could follow/use  $K_{j}$  through  $K_{T}$  even when  $K_{B}$  does not attain its replication in the corresponding parts of the state space. This allows for a good performance of the agent in earlier stages training itself, when a useful source task is available and identified.

Since the attention is soft, our model has the flexibility to combine multiple solutions. The use of deep neural networks allows the model to work even for large, complex RL problems. The deep attention network, allows the agent to learn complex selection functions, without worrying about representation issues a priori. To summarise, for a given state, A2T learns to attend to specific solutions and adapts this attention over different states, hence attaining useful transfer. A2T is general and can be used for transfer of solutions such as policy and value.

# 3.1 POLICY TRANSFER

The solutions that we transfer here are the source task policies, taking advantage of which, we learn a policy for the target task. Thus, we have  $K_{1},\ldots ,K_{N},K_{B},K_{T}\gets \pi_{1},\ldots \pi_{N},\pi_{B},\pi_{T}$ . Here  $\pi$  represents a stochastic policy, a probability distribution over all the actions. The agent acts in the target task, by sampling actions from the probability distribution  $\pi_T$ . The target task policy  $\pi_T$  is got as described in Eq.(1) and Eq.(2). The attention network that produces the weights for the different

solutions, is trained by the feedback got after taking action following  $\pi_T$ . The base network that produces  $\pi_B$  is trained as if the sampled action came from  $\pi_B$  (though it originally came from  $\pi_T$ ), the implications of which were discussed in the previous section. When the attention network's weight for the policy  $\pi_B$  is high, the mixture policy  $\pi_T$  is dominated by  $\pi_B$ , and the base network learning is nearly on-policy. In the other cases,  $\pi_B$  undergoes off-policy learning. But if look closely, even in the latter case, since  $\pi_B$  moves towards  $\pi_T$ , it tries to be nearly on-policy all the time. Empirically, we observe that  $\pi_B$  converges. This architecture for policy transfer can be used alongside any algorithm that has an explicit representation of the policy. Here we describe two instantiations of A2T for policy transfer, one for direct policy search using REINFORCE algorithm and another in the Actor-Critic setup.

# 3.1.1 POLICY TRANSFER IN REINFORCE ALGORITHMS USING A2T:

REINFORCE algorithms [Williams (1992)] can be used for direct policy search by making weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of the expected reinforcement. The full architecture is same as the one shown in Fig.1a with  $K \gets \pi$ . We do direct policy search, and the parameters are updated using REINFORCE. Let the attention network be parametrized by  $\theta_{a}$  and the base network which outputs  $\pi_{B}$  be parametrized by  $\theta_{b}$ . The updates are given by:

$$
\theta_ {a} \leftarrow \theta_ {a} + \alpha_ {\theta_ {a}} (r - b) \frac {\partial \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {M} \log \left(\pi_ {T} \left(s _ {t} , a _ {t}\right)\right)}{\partial \theta_ {a}} \tag {5}
$$

$$
\theta_ {b} \leftarrow \theta_ {b} + \alpha_ {\theta_ {b}} (r - b) \frac {\partial \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {M} \log \left(\pi_ {B} \left(s _ {t} , a _ {t}\right)\right)}{\partial \theta_ {b}} \tag {6}
$$

where  $\alpha_{\theta_a}, \alpha_{\theta_b}$  are non-negative factors,  $r$  is the return obtained in the episode,  $b$  is some baseline and  $M$  is the length of the episode.  $a_t$  is the action sampled by the agent at state  $s_t$  following  $\pi_T$ . Note that while  $\pi_T(s_t, a_t)$  is used in the update of the attention network,  $\pi_B(s_t, a_t)$  is used in the update of the base network.

# 3.1.2 POLICY TRANSFER IN ACTOR-CRITIC USING A2T:

Actor-Critic methods [Konda & Tsitsiklis (2000)] are Temporal Difference (TD) methods that have two separate components, viz., an actor and a critic. The actor proposes a policy whereas the critic estimates the value function to critique the actor's policy. The updates to the actor happens through TD-error which is the one step estimation error that helps in reinforcing an agent's behaviour.

We use A2T for the actor part of the Actor-Critic. The architecture is shown in Fig.1b. The actor, A2T is aware of all the previous learnt tasks and tries to use those solution policies for its benefit. The critic evaluates the action selection from  $\pi_T$  on the basis of the performance on the target task. With the same notations as REINFORCE for  $s_t, a_t, \theta_a, \theta_b, \alpha_{\theta_a}, \alpha_{\theta_b}, \pi_B, \pi_T$ ; let action  $a_t$  dictated by  $\pi_T$  lead the agent to next state  $s_{t+1}$  with a reward of  $r_{t+1}$  and let  $V(s_t)$  represent the value of state  $s_t$  and  $\gamma$  the discount factor. Then, the update equations for the actor are as below:

$$
\delta_ {t} = r _ {t + 1} + \gamma V \left(s _ {t + 1}\right) - V \left(s _ {t}\right) \tag {7}
$$

$$
\theta_ {a} \leftarrow \theta_ {a} + \alpha_ {\theta_ {a}} \delta_ {t} \frac {\frac {\partial \log \pi_ {T} \left(s _ {t} , a _ {t}\right)}{\partial \theta_ {a}}}{\left| \frac {\partial \log \pi_ {T} \left(s _ {t} , a _ {t}\right)}{\partial \theta_ {a}} \right|} \tag {8}
$$

$$
\theta_ {b} \leftarrow \theta_ {b} + \alpha_ {\theta_ {b}} \delta_ {t} \frac {\frac {\partial \log \pi_ {B} \left(s _ {t} , a _ {t}\right)}{\partial \theta_ {b}}}{\left| \frac {\partial \log \pi_ {B} \left(s _ {t} , a _ {t}\right)}{\partial \theta_ {b}} \right|} \tag {9}
$$

Here,  $\delta_t$  is TD error. The state-value function  $V$  of the critic is learnt using TD learning.

# 3.2 VALUE TRANSFER

In this case, the solutions being transferred are the source tasks' action-value functions, which we will call as  $Q$  functions. Thus,  $K1,\ldots ,K_{N},K_{B},K_{T}\gets Q_{1},\ldots ,Q_{N},Q_{B},Q_{T}$ . Let  $A$  represent

the discrete action space for the tasks and  $Q_{i}(s) = \{Q(s,a_{j})\forall a_{j}\in A\}$ . The agent acts by using  $Q_{T}$  in the target task, which is got as described in Eq.(1) and Eq.(2). The attention network and the base network of A2T are updated as described in the architecture.

# 3.2.1 VALUE TRANSFER IN Q LEARNING USING A2T:

The state-action value  $Q$  function is used to guide the agent to selecting the optimal action  $a$  at a state  $s$ , where  $Q(s, a)$  is a measure of the long-term return obtained by taking action  $a$  at state  $s$ . One way to learn optimal policies for an agent is to estimate the optimal  $Q(s, a)$  for the task. Q-learning [Watkins & Dayan (1992)] is an off-policy Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm that does so. The Q-values are updated iteratively through the Bellman optimality equation [Puterman (1994)] with the rewards obtained from the task as below:

$$
Q (s, a) \leftarrow \mathbb {E} \left[ r \left(s, a, s ^ {\prime}\right) + \gamma \max  _ {a ^ {\prime}} Q \left(s ^ {\prime}, a ^ {\prime}\right) \right]
$$

In high dimensional state spaces, it is infeasible to update Q-value for all possible state-action pairs. One way to address this issue is by approximating  $Q(s,a)$  through a parametrized function approximator  $Q(s,a;\theta)$ , thereby generalizing over states and actions by operating on higher level features [Sutton & Barto (1998)]. The DQN [Mnih et al. (2015)] approximates the Q-value function with a deep neural network to be able to predict  $Q(s,a)$  over all actions  $a$ , for all states  $s$ .

The loss function used for learning a Deep Q Network is as below:

$$
L (\theta) = \mathbb {E} _ {s, a, r, s ^ {\prime}} [ (y ^ {D Q N} - Q (s, a; \theta)) ^ {2} ],
$$

with

$$
y ^ {D Q N} = \left(r + \gamma \max  _ {a ^ {\prime}} Q \left(s ^ {\prime}, a ^ {\prime}, \theta^ {-}\right)\right)
$$

Here,  $L$  represents the expected TD error corresponding to current parameter estimate  $\theta$ .  $\theta^{-}$ represents the parameters of a separate target network, while  $\theta$  represents the parameters of the online network. The usage of a target network is to improve the stability of the learning updates. The gradient descent step is shown below:

$$
\nabla_ {\theta} L (\theta) = \mathbb {E} _ {s, a, r, s ^ {\prime}} [ (y ^ {D Q N} - Q (s, a; \theta)) \nabla_ {\theta} Q (s, a) ]
$$

To avoid correlated updates from learning on the same transitions that the current network simulates, an experience replay [Lin (1993)]  $D$  (of fixed maximum capacity) is used, where the experiences are pooled in a FIFO fashion.

We use DQN to learn our experts  $Q_{i}, i \in 1,2\ldots N$  on the source tasks. Q-learning is used to ensure  $Q_{T}(s)$  is driven to a good estimate of  $Q$  functions for the target task. Taking advantage of the off-policy nature of Q-learning, both  $Q_{B}$  and  $Q_{T}$  can be learned from the experiences gathered by an  $\epsilon$ -greedy behavioral policy based on  $Q_{T}$ . Let the attention network that outputs  $w$  be parametrised by  $\theta_{a}$  and the base network outputting  $Q_{B}$  be parametrised by  $\theta_{b}$ . Let  $\theta_{a}^{-}$  and  $\theta_{b}^{-}$  represent the parameters of the respective target networks. Note that the usage of target here is to signify the parameters  $(\theta_{a}^{-},\theta_{b}^{-})$  used to calculate the target value in the Q-learning update and is different from its usage in the context of the target task. The updates equations are:

$$
y ^ {Q _ {T}} = \left(r + \gamma \max  _ {a ^ {\prime}} Q _ {T} \left(s ^ {\prime}, a ^ {\prime}; \theta_ {a} ^ {-}, \theta_ {b} ^ {-}\right)\right) \tag {10}
$$

$$
L ^ {Q _ {T}} \left(\theta_ {a}, \theta_ {b}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {s, a, r, s ^ {\prime}} \left[ \left(y ^ {Q _ {T}} - Q _ {T} \left(s, a; \theta_ {a}, \theta_ {b}\right)\right) ^ {2} \right] \tag {11}
$$

$$
L ^ {Q _ {B}} \left(\theta_ {b}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {s, a, r, s ^ {\prime}} \left[ \left(y ^ {Q _ {T}} - Q _ {B} (s, a; \theta_ {b})\right) ^ {2} \right] \tag {12}
$$

$$
\nabla_ {\theta_ {a}} L ^ {Q _ {T}} = \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(y ^ {Q _ {T}} - Q _ {T} (s, a)\right) \nabla_ {\theta_ {a}} Q _ {T} (s, a) \right] \tag {13}
$$

$$
\nabla_ {\theta_ {b}} L ^ {Q _ {B}} = \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(y ^ {Q _ {T}} - Q _ {B} (s, a)\right) \nabla_ {\theta_ {b}} Q _ {R} (s, a) \right] \tag {14}
$$

$\theta_{a}$  and  $\theta_{b}$  are updated with the above gradients using RMSProp. Note that the Q-learning updates for both the attention network (Eq.(11)) and the base network (Eq.(12)) use the target value generated by  $Q_{T}$ . We use target networks for both  $Q_{B}$  and  $Q_{T}$  to stabilize the updates and reduce the nonstationarity as in DQN training. The parameters of the target networks are periodically updated to that of the online networks.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION

We evaluate the performance of our architecture A2T on policy transfer using two simulated worlds, viz., chain world and puddle world as described below. The main goal of these experiments is to test the consistency of results with the algorithm motivation. Chain world: Figure 2a shows the chain world where the goal of the agent is to go from one point in the chain (starting state) to another point (goal state) in the least number of steps. At each state the agent can choose to either move one position to the left or to the right. After reaching the goal state the agent gets a reward that is inversely proportional to the number of steps taken to reach the goal. Puddle worlds: Figures 2b and 2c show the discrete version of the standard puddle world that is widely used in Reinforcement Learning literature. In this world, the goal of the agent is to go from a specified start position to the goal position, maximising its return. At each state the agent can choose one of these four actions: move one position to the north, south, east or west. With 0.9 probability the agent moves in the chosen direction and with 0.1 probability it moves in a random direction irrespective of its choice of action. On reaching the goal state, the agent gets a reward of  $+10$ . On reaching other parts of the grid the agent gets different penalties as mentioned in the legend of the figures. We evaluate the performance of our architecture on value transfer using the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) platform [Bellemare et al. (2012)]. Atari 2600: ALE provides a simulator for Atari 2600 games. This is one of the most commonly used benchmark tasks for deep reinforcement learning algorithms [Mnih et al. (2015), Mnih et al. (2016), Parisotto et al. (2015), Rusu et al. (2016)]. We perform our adaptive transfer learning experiments on the Atari 2600 game Pong.

# 4.1 ABILITY TO DO SELECTIVE TRANSFER

In this section, we consider the case when multiple partially favorable source tasks are available such that each of them can assist the learning process for different parts of the state space of the target task. The objective here is to first show the effectiveness of the attention network in learning to focus only on the source task relevant to the state the agent encounters while trying to complete the target task and then evaluating the full architecture with an additional randomly initialised base network.

This is illustrated for the Policy Transfer setting using the chain world shown in (Fig. 2a). Consider that the target task  $LT$  is to start in  $A$  or  $B$  with uniform probability and reach  $C$  in the least number of steps. Now, consider that two learned source tasks, viz.,  $L1$  and  $L2$ , are available.  $L1$  is the source task where the agent has learned to reach the left end ( $A$ ) starting from the right end ( $B$ ). In contrast,  $L2$  is the source task where the agent has learned to reach the right end ( $B$ ) starting from the left end ( $A$ ). Intuitively, it is clear that the target task should benefit from the policies learnt for tasks  $L1$  and  $L2$ . We learn to solve the task  $LT$  using REINFORCE given the policies learned for  $L1$  and  $L2$ . Figure 3a (i) shows the weights given by the attention network to the two source task policies for different parts of the state space at the end of learning. We observe that the attention network has learned to ignore  $L1$ , and  $L2$  for the left, and right half of the state space of the target task, respectively. Next, we add base network and evaluate the full architecture on this task. Figure 3a (ii) shows the weights given by the attention network to the different source policies for different parts of the state space at the end of learning. We observe that the attention network has learned to ignore  $L1$ , and  $L2$  for the left, and right half of the state space of the target task, respectively. As the

base network replicates  $\pi_T$  over time, it has a high weight throughout the state space of the target task.

We also evaluate our architecture in a relatively more complex puddle world shown in Figure 2c. In this case,  $L1$  is the task of moving from  $S1$  to  $G1$ , and  $L2$  is the task of moving from  $S2$  to  $G1$ . In the target task  $LT$ , the agent has to learn to move to  $G1$  starting from either  $S1$  or  $S2$  chosen with uniform probability. We learn the task  $LT$  using Actor-Critic method, where the following are available (i) learned policy for  $L1$  (ii) learned policy for  $L2$  and (iii) a randomly initialized policy network (the base network). Figure 3b shows the performance results. We observe that actor-critic using A2T is able to use the policies learned for  $L1$ , and  $L2$  and performs better than a network learning from scratch without any knowledge of source tasks.

We do a similar evaluation of the attention network, followed by our full architecture for value transfer as well. We create partially useful source tasks through a modification of the Atari 2600 game Pong. We take inspiration from a real world scenario in the sport Tennis, where one could imagine two different right-handed (or left) players with the first being an expert player on the forehand but weak on the backhand, while the second is an expert player on the backhand but weak on the forehand. For someone who is learning to play tennis with the same style (right/left) as the experts, it is easy to follow the forehand expert player whenever he receives a ball on the forehand and follows the backhand expert whenever he receives a ball on the backhand.

We try to simulate this scenario in Pong. The trick is to blur the part of the screen where we want to force the agent to be weak at returning the ball. The blurring we use is to just black out all pixels in the specific region required. To make sure the blurring doesn't contrast with the background, we

modify Pong to be played with a black background (pixel value 0) instead of the existing gray (pixel value 87). We construct two partially helpful source task experts  $L1$  and  $L2$ .  $L1$  is constructed by training a DQN on Pong with the upper quadrant (the agent's side) blurred, while  $L2$  is constructed by training a DQN with the lower quadrant (the agent's side) blurred. This essentially results in the ball being invisible when it is in the upper quadrant for  $L1$  and lower quadrant for  $L2$ . We therefore expect  $L1$  to be useful in guiding to return balls on the lower quadrant, and  $L2$  for the upper quadrant. The goal of the attention network is to learn suitable filters and parameters so that it will focus on the correct source task for a specific situation in the game. The source task experts  $L1$  and  $L2$  scored an average of 9.2 and 8 respectively on Pong game play with black background. With an attention network to suitably weigh the value functions of  $L1$  and  $L2$ , an average performance of 17.2 was recorded just after a single epoch (250,000 frames) of training. (The score in Pong is in the range of  $[-21, 21]$ ). This clearly shows that the attention mechanism has learned to take advantage of the experts adaptively. Fig. 4 shows a visualisation of the attention weights for the same.

We then evaluate our full architecture (A2T) in this setting, i.e with an addition of DQN learning from scratch (base network) to the above setting. The architecture can take advantage of the knowledge of the source task experts selectively early on during the training while using the expertise of the base network wherever required, to perform well on the target task. Figure 5 summarizes the results, where it is clear that learning with both the partially useful experts is better than learning with only one of them which in turn is better than learning from scratch without any additional knowledge.

# 4.2 ABILITY TO AVOID NEGATIVE TRANSFER AND ABILITY TO TRANSFER FROM FAVORABLE TASK

We first consider the case when only one learned source task is available such that its solution  $K_{1}$  (policy or value) can hamper the learning process of the new target task. We refer to such a source task as an unfavorable source task. In such a scenario, the attention network shown in Figure 1a should learn to assign a very low weight (ignore) to  $K_{1}$ . We also consider a modification of this setting by adding another source task whose solution  $K_{2}$  is favorable to the target task. In such a scenario, the attention network should learn to assign high weight (attend) to  $K_{2}$  while ignoring  $K_{1}$ .

We now define an experiment using the puddle world from Figure 2b for policy transfer. The target task in our experiment is to maximize the return in reaching the goal state  $G1$  starting from any one of the states  $S1, S2, S3, S4$ . We artificially construct an unfavorable source task by first learning to solve the above task and then negating the weights of the topmost layer of the actor network. We then add a favorable task to the above setting. We artificially construct a favorable source task simply by learning to solve the target task and using the learned actor network. Figure 6 shows the results.

The target task for the value transfer experiment is to reach expert level performance on Pong. We construct two kinds of unfavorable source tasks for this experiment. Inverse-Pong: A DQN on Pong trained with negated reward functions, that

is with  $R^{\prime}(s,a) = -R(s,a)$  where  $R(s,a)$  is the reward provided by the ALE emulator for choosing action  $a$  at state  $s$ . Freeway: An expert DQN on another Atari 2600 game, Freeway, which has

the same range of optimal value functions and same action space as Pong. We empirically verified that the Freeway expert DQN leads to negative transfer when directly initialized and fine-tuned on Pong which makes this a good proxy for a negative source task expert even though the target task Pong has a different state space. We artificially construct a favorable source task by learning a DQN to achieve expertise on the target task (Pong) and use the learned network. Figure 7a compares the performance of the various scenarios when the unfavorable source task is Inverse-Pong, while Figure 7b offers a similar comparison with the negative expert being Freeway.

From all the above results, we can clearly see that A2T does not get hampered by the unfavorable source task by learning to ignore the same and performs competitively with just a randomly initialized learning on the target task without any expert available. Secondly, in the presence of an additional source task that is favorable, A2T learns to transfer useful knowledge from the same while ignoring the unfavorable task, thereby reaching expertise on the target task much faster than the other scenarios.

# 5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper we present a very general deep neural network architecture, A2T for transfer learning that avoids negative transfer while enabling selective transfer from multiple source tasks in the same domain. We show simple ways of using A2T for policy transfer and value transfer. We empirically evaluate its performance with different algorithms, using simulated worlds and games, and show that it indeed achieves its stated goals. Apart from transferring task solutions, A2T can also be used for transferring other useful knowledge such as the model.

While in this work we focused on transfer between tasks that share the same state and action spaces and are in the same domain, the use of deep networks opens up the possibility of going beyond this setting. For example, a deep neural network can be used to learn common representations [Parisotto et al. (2015)] for multiple tasks thereby enabling transfer between related tasks that could possibly have different state-action spaces. A hierarchical attention over the lower level filters across source task networks while learning the filters for the target task network is another natural extension to transfer across tasks with different state-action spaces. We would also like to explore this setting in avoiding negative transfer in continuous control tasks since negative transfer has practical importance in Robotics. Over all, we believe that A2T is a novel way to approach transfer learning that opens up many new avenues of research in this area.
