# ABSTRACT

Regularization and normalization have become an indispensable component in deep learning because it enables faster training and improved generalization performance. We propose the projected error function regularization loss (PER) that encourages activations to follow the standard normal distribution. PER randomly projects activations to one dimensional space and computes the regularization in the projected space. PER acts like the Pseudo-Huber loss in the projected space, enabling robust regularization for training deep neural networks. In addition, PER can capture interaction between hidden units by projection vector drawn from unit sphere. By doing so, PER minimizes the upper bound of the Wasserstein distance of order one between an empirical distribution of activations and the standard normal distribution. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to regularize activations concerning the target distribution in the probability distribution space. We evaluate the proposed method on image classification task and word-level language modeling task.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Training of deep neural networks is very challenging because of vanishing and exploding gradient problem (Hochreiter, 1998; Glorot & Bengio, 2010), existence of many flat regions and saddle points (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2017), and the shattered gradient problem (Balduzzi et al., 2017). To remedy these issues, various methods for controlling hidden activations have been proposed such as normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015; Huang et al., 2018), regularization (Littwin & Wolf, 2018), initialization (Mishkin & Matas, 2015; Zhang et al., 2019), and architecture design (He et al., 2016).

Among various techniques of controlling activations, one well-known and successful path is controlling their first and second moments. Back in 1990s, it has been known that the neural network training can be benefited from normalizing input statistics so that samples have zero mean and identity covariance matrix (LeCun et al., 1998; Schraudolph, 1998). This idea motivated batch normalization (BN) that considers hidden activations as the input to the next layer and normalizes scale and shift of the activations (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).

Recent works show the effectiveness of different sample statistics of activations for normalization and regularization. Deecke et al. (2018) and Kalayeh & Shah (2019) normalize activations to several modes with different scales and translations. Variance constancy loss (VCL) implicitly normalizes the fourth moment by minimizing the variance of sample variances, which enables adaptive mode separation or collapse based on their prior probabilities (Littwin & Wolf, 2018). In addition, BN is extended to whiten activations (Huang et al., 2018; 2019), and to normalize general order of central moment in the sense of  $L^p$  norm including  $L^0$  and  $L^\infty$  (Liao et al., 2016; Hoffer et al., 2018).

In this paper, we propose a new regularization method, called projected error function regularization (PER), that regularizes activations in probability distribution space with the Wasserstein metric. Specifically, PER encourages the distribution of activations to be close to the standard normal distribution. PER shares a similar strategy that dictates the desired distribution of activations with previous normalization/regularization methods such as BN and VCL. However, previous approaches are capable of concerning single, or few, sample statistics of activations. On the contrary, PER presents new perspective of concerning the target distribution  $\mathcal{N}(0,I)$  for controlling the activations. By

concerning the distribution itself, PER can implicitly consider various statistical characteristics simultaneously, e.g. all order of moments and correlation between hidden units. The extensive experiments on multiple challenging tasks show the efficiency of PER.

# 2 RELATED WORKS

Since BN has been proposed, many normalization methods (Salimans & Kingma, 2016; Lei Ba et al., 2016; Ulyanov et al., 2016; Wu & He, 2018; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018) have been suggested by normalizing activations to have a sample mean  $\beta$  and sample standard deviation  $\gamma$ . Even though its theoretical aspects on regularization and optimization are still being actively investigated (Santurkar et al., 2018; Kohler et al., 2018; Bjorck et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019), many modern deep learning architectures employ BN as an essential building block for better performance and stable training.

Based on the work of Ioffe & Szegedy (2015), Huang et al. (2018; 2019) proposed normalization technique whitening the activation of each layer. These additional constraints on statistical relationship between activations show an significant improvement in generalization performance of residual networks. Although correlations, or statistical dependency between activations, are not explicitly constrained, dropout prevents activations from being activated at the same time, called coadaptation, by randomly dropping the activations (Srivastava et al., 2014), the weights (Wan et al., 2013), and the spatially connected activations (Ghiasi et al., 2018).

Considering the BN as forcing activations to have learned value of norm of each unit in  $L^2$  space, there are extensions that use other norms. Streaming normalization (Liao et al., 2016) explores the normalization of a different order of central moment with  $L^p$  norm for general  $p$ . Similarly, Hoffer et al. (2018) explores  $L^1$  and  $L^\infty$  normalization, which enable low precision computation. Littwin & Wolf (2018) proposes a regularization loss that reduces the variance of sample variances of activation which is closely related to the fourth moment.

Initialization schemes such as balancing variances of each layer (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; He et al., 2015), bounding scale of activation and gradient in residual networks (Mishkin & Matas, 2015; Balduzzi et al., 2017; Gehring et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019), and norm preserving (Saxe et al., 2013) can be thought as stabilizing activations at the initial state. Although it cannot be guaranteed that the desired initial state of activations is maintained during the course of training unlike normalization and regularization approaches, experimental evidences show that an initialization scheme can stabilize the learning process as well.

Recently, the Wasserstein metric have gained much popularity in a wide range of applications in deep learning with some nice properties such as being a metric in probability distribution space without requiring common supports of two distributions. For instance, it is successfully applied to a multi-labeled classification loss function (Frogner et al., 2015), gradient flow of policy update in reinforcement learning (Zhang et al., 2018), training of generative models (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Gulrajani et al., 2017; Kolouri et al., 2019), and capturing long term semantic structure in sequence-to-sequence language model (Chen et al., 2019). However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, PER is the first work regularizing activations in the Wasserstein probability distribution space.

# 3 PROJECTED ERROR FUNCTION REGULARIZATION

We consider a neural network with  $L$  layers each of which have  $d_{l}$  hidden units in layer  $l$ . Let  $\mathcal{T} = \{(\pmb{x}_i,\pmb{y}_i)\}_{i=1}^n$  be  $n$  training samples which are assumed to be i.i.d. samples drawn from a probability distribution  $P_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}$ . In this paper, we consider the optimization by stochastic gradient descent where we are given mini-batch of  $b$  samples randomly drawn from  $\mathcal{T}$  at each training iteration. For  $i$ -th element in the mini-batch, the neural network recursively computes:

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l} = \phi (\boldsymbol {W} ^ {l} \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l - 1} + \boldsymbol {b} ^ {l}) \tag {1}
$$

where  $\pmb{h}_i^0 = \pmb{x}_i\in \mathbb{R}^{d_0}$ ,  $\pmb{h}_i^l\in \mathbb{R}^{d_l}$  is an  $i$ -th element of activation in layer  $l$ ,  $\phi$  is an activation function. In the case of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the recursive relationship takes the form of:

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {t _ {i}} ^ {l} = \phi \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {\text {r e c}} ^ {l} \boldsymbol {h} _ {t - 1 _ {i}} ^ {l} + \boldsymbol {W} _ {\text {i n}} ^ {l} \boldsymbol {h} _ {t _ {i}} ^ {l - 1} + \boldsymbol {b} ^ {l}\right) \tag {2}
$$

where  $\pmb{h}_{t_i}^l$  is an  $i$ -th element of activation in layer  $l$  at time  $t$  and  $\pmb{h}_{0_i}^l$  is an initial state. Without loss of generality, we focus on activations in layer  $l$  and the mini-batch of samples  $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^b$ . Throughout this paper, we let  $f^l$  be a function made by compositions of recurrent relation in equation 2 up to layer  $l$ , i.e.,  $\pmb{h}_i^l = f^l(\pmb{x}_i)$ , and  $f_j^l$  be a  $j$ -th output of a function  $f^l$ .

We are interested in the problem of controlling a set of hidden activations  $\left\{\pmb{h}_i^l\right\}_{i=1}^b$  observed in mini-batch. Before introducing our method, we review BN and its variants as controlling activations by concerning the norm in  $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{d_0})$  which is the space of measurable functions whose  $p$ -th power of absolute value is Lebesgue integrable with norm of  $f \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^{d_0})$  is given by:

$$
\| f \| _ {p} = \left(\int_ {\mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {0}}} | f (\boldsymbol {x}) | ^ {p} d P _ {\boldsymbol {x}} (\boldsymbol {x})\right) ^ {1 / p} <   \infty \tag {3}
$$

where  $P_{\mathbf{x}}$  is the unknown probability distribution generating training samples  $\{\pmb{x}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ . Since we have no access to  $P_{\mathbf{x}}$ , it is approximated by the empirical measure of mini-batch samples  $\nu_{\mathbf{x}} = \frac{1}{b}\sum_{i=1}^{b}\delta_{\pmb{x}_i}$  where  $\delta_{\pmb{x}}$  is the Dirac unit mass on  $\pmb{x}$ .

BN and its variants normalize  $L^p$  norm of centralized activations $^1$ , then scale and shift the normalized activations by learnable parameters. That is, the normalization methods  $\psi^l$  at layer  $l$  can be represented by composition of a normalizing function  $\psi_p^l$  and a learnable linear function  $\psi_s^l$ :

$$
\psi^ {l} \left(h _ {i j} ^ {l}\right) = \psi_ {s} ^ {l} \left(\psi_ {p} ^ {l} \left(h _ {i j} ^ {l}\right)\right) = \gamma_ {j} ^ {l} \psi_ {p} ^ {l} \left(h _ {i j} ^ {l}\right) + \beta_ {j} ^ {l} \quad \psi_ {p} ^ {l} \left(h _ {i j} ^ {l}\right) = \frac {h _ {i j} ^ {l} - \bar {\mu} _ {j}}{\left(\sum_ {k} \frac {1}{b} \left| h _ {k j} ^ {l} - \bar {\mu} _ {j} \right| ^ {p}\right) ^ {1 / p}} \tag {4}
$$

where  $h_{ij}^{l}$  is  $j$ -th unit of  $\pmb{h}_i^l$ ,  $\bar{\mu}_j = \frac{1}{b}\sum_k h_{kj}^l$  is the sample mean, and  $\beta_j^l$  and  $\gamma_j^l$  is a learnable shift and scale parameters. We can see that  $\psi_p^l$  gives the constant norm  $\| \psi_p^l \circ f_j^l \|_p = 1$  for any unit  $j$  and any empirical measure, i.e. samples of mini-batch. Therefore, the  $L^p$  norm of the function to  $j$ -th unit is bounded as:  $\| \psi^l \circ f_j^l \|_p \leq \| \gamma_j^l\psi_p^l \circ f_j^l \|_p + \| \beta_j^l \|_p = \gamma_j^l + \beta_j^l$ .

Instead of constraining norm of  $f_{j}^{l}$  to have certain value, PER concerns the 1-Wasserstein distance between empirical distribution of activations and the standard normal distribution in the probability distribution space  $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d_l})$ . Specifically, PER adopts a soft constraint approach that minimizes the upper bound of the Wasserstein distance which will be proved in section 3.1. Let  $\nu_{\mathbf{h}^l} = \frac{1}{b}\sum_i\delta_{\mathbf{h}_i^l}\in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d_l})$  be an empirical measure of hidden activations computed for mini-batch at layer  $l$ . Then, the loss and the gradient of PER for  $\nu_{\mathbf{h}^l}$  are defined as:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {p e r} \left(\nu_ {\mathbf {h} ^ {l}}\right) = \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {b} \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta} \sim U \left(\mathbb {S} ^ {d _ {l} - 1}\right)} \left[ \langle \boldsymbol {\theta}, \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l} \rangle \operatorname {e r f} \left(\frac {\langle \boldsymbol {\theta} , \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l} \rangle}{\sqrt {2}}\right) + \sqrt {\frac {2}{\pi}} \exp \left(- \frac {\langle \boldsymbol {\theta} , \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l} \rangle^ {2}}{2}\right) \right] \tag {5}
$$

$$
\nabla_ {\boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l}} \mathcal {L} _ {p e r} \left(\nu_ {\mathbf {h} ^ {l}}\right) = \frac {1}{b} \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta} \sim U \left(\mathbb {S} ^ {d _ {l} - 1}\right)} \left[ \operatorname {e r f} \left(\left\langle \boldsymbol {\theta}, \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l} / \sqrt {2} \right\rangle\right) \boldsymbol {\theta} \right] \tag {6}
$$

where  $\mathbb{S}^{d_l - 1}$  is the unit sphere in  $\mathbb{R}^{d_l}$  and  $U(\mathbb{S}^{d_l - 1})$  is the uniform distribution on  $\mathbb{S}^{d_l - 1}$ . In this paper, expectation over  $U(\mathbb{S}^{d_l - 1})$  will be approximated by the Monte Carlo method with  $s$  number of samples. Therefore, PER results in simple modification of the backward pass as in Alg. 1. As shown in the Fig. 1,  $\mathcal{L}_{per}$  acts like the Pseudo-Huber loss  $g(x) = \sqrt{1 + x^2} - 1$  in the projected space. The Pseudo-Huber loss is smooth approximation of the Huber loss (Huber, 1964), and it is widely used in the context of the robust statistics (Barron, 2019). This robustness can prevent explosion of activation regularization loss due to outliers having large values that are prevalent in forward pass of deep neural networks without a normalization technique.

In addition, PER captures interaction between hidden units unlike activation norm regularization loss that is widely used in RNNs (Merit et al., 2017). Consider  $L^p$  activation norm as  $\frac{1}{b}\sum_{i}\parallel$

Input The number of Monte Carlo evaluations  $s$ , an activation for  $i$ -th sample  $h_i$ , the gradient of the loss  $\nabla_{h_i}\mathcal{L}$ , a regularization coefficient  $\lambda$

Figure 1: Illustration of PER loss and gradient in  $\mathbb{R}$ . Herein, PER loss is shifted by  $c$  so that  $\mathcal{L}_{per}(\delta_0) - c = 0$ . Huber loss is defined as  $h(x) = |x| - 0.5$  in  $|x| > 1$  and  $h(x) = x^2 / 2$  in  $|x| \leq 1$ .

$\pmb{h}_i^l\|_p^p = \frac{1}{b}\sum_{i,j} |h_{ij}^l|^p = \frac{1}{b}\sum_{i,j} |\langle \pmb{h}_i^l, \pmb{e}_j \rangle|^p$  where  $\{\pmb{e}_j\}_{j=1}^{d_l}$  is the natural basis of  $\mathbb{R}^{d_l}$ . That is, the activation norm regularization can be thought as computing the regularization loss of activations by projecting them using the natural basis. However, PER use more rich classes of projection vectors  $\theta \sim U(\mathbb{S}^{d_l-1})$ , encoding interaction between hidden units into the regularization loss.

# 3.1 DISTRIBUTION MATCHING WITH THE WASSERSTEIN METRIC

To understand the properties of PER, we examine the Wasserstein distance between activations and  $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I})$ . The Wasserstein metric of order  $p$  between two probability measures  $\mu$  and  $\nu$  is defined by:

$$
W _ {p} (\mu , \nu) = \left(\inf  _ {\pi \in \Pi (\mu , \nu)} \int_ {\Omega \times \Omega} d ^ {p} (\boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {y}) \pi (d \boldsymbol {x}, d \boldsymbol {y})\right) ^ {1 / p} \tag {7}
$$

where  $\prod (\mu ,\nu)$  is the set of all joint probability measures on  $\Omega \times \Omega$  having the first and the second marginals  $\mu$  and  $\nu$ , respectively.

Lemma 1. Let  $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$  be the Gaussian measure defined as  $\mu (\mathbb{A}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{\mathbb{A}}\exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} x^2\right)dx$  and  $\nu_{\mathrm{h}}\in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$  be an empirical measure of observations defined as  $\nu_{\mathrm{h}} = \frac{1}{b}\sum_{i}\delta_{h_i}$ . Then,  $\mathcal{L}_{per}(\nu_{\mathrm{h}})$  is an upper bound of  $W_{1}(\mu ,\nu_{\mathrm{h}})$ .

Proof. In  $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ , the 1-Wasserstein  $W_{1}(\mu, \nu)$  can be formulated as (Rachev & Ruschendorf, 1998):

$$
W _ {1} (\mu , \nu_ {\mathrm {h}}) = \int_ {0} ^ {1} | F _ {\mu} ^ {- 1} (z) - F _ {\nu_ {\mathrm {h}}} ^ {- 1} (z) | d z = \int_ {- \infty} ^ {\infty} | F _ {\mu} (x) - F _ {\nu_ {\mathrm {h}}} (x) | d x \tag {8}
$$

where  $F_{\mu}$  and  $F_{\nu_{\mathrm{h}}}$  are cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of measures  $\mu$  and  $\nu_{\mathrm{h}}$ , respectively. We have  $|F_{\mu} - F_{\nu_{h_i}}| \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$  where  $\nu_{h_i} = \delta_{h_i}$  for given  $h_i$ . Therefore, applying the Minkowski

Figure 2: Illustration of minimization of the sliced Wasserstein distance between the current distribution and the target distribution. Note that it only concerns a distance in projected dimension.

inequality to equation 8 gives:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \int_ {- \infty} ^ {\infty} | F _ {\mu} (x) - \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {b} 1 _ {h _ {i} \leq x} | d x \leq \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {i} \int_ {- \infty} ^ {\infty} | F _ {\mu} (x) - 1 _ {h _ {i} \leq x} | d x \\ = \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {i} \left(x _ {i} \operatorname {e r f} \left(\frac {x _ {i}}{\sqrt {2}}\right) + \sqrt {\frac {2}{\pi}} \exp \left(- \frac {x _ {i} ^ {2}}{2}\right)\right) = \mathcal {L} _ {p e r} (\nu_ {\mathrm {h}}) \tag {9} \\ \end{array}
$$

which completes the proof.

To extend the Lemma 1 from  $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$  to  $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d_l})$ , we consider the sliced Wasserstein distance (Rabin et al., 2011) which approximates the Wasserstein distance in a high dimensional distribution space by projecting the distributions to  $\mathbb{R}$  (Fig. 2). It is proved by that sliced Wasserstein and Wasserstein are equivalent metrics (Santambrogio, 2015; Bonnotte, 2013). The sliced Wasserstein of order one can be formulated as:

$$
S W _ {1} (\mu , \nu) = \int_ {\mathbb {S} ^ {d - 1}} W _ {1} \left(\mu_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}}, \nu_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}}\right) d \lambda (\boldsymbol {\theta}) \tag {10}
$$

where  $\mu_{\theta}$  and  $\nu_{\theta}$  represent the measures projected at the angle  $\theta$ , and  $\lambda$  is an uniform measure on  $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ .

Corollary 2. For the Gaussian measure  $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d_l})$  and the empirical measure of activations  $\nu_{\mathbf{h}} = \frac{1}{b}\sum_{i}\delta_{\pmb {h}_i},\mathcal{L}_{per}(\nu_{\mathbf{h}})$  is an upper bound of  $SW_{1}(\mu ,\nu_{\mathbf{h}})$ .

Proof. We have  $\mu_{\theta}(A) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{A}\exp \left\{-\frac{1}{2} x^{2}\right\} dx$  for any choice of  $\theta$ . Then, applying Lemma 1 to equation 10 yields the desired result:

$$
\begin{array}{l} S W _ {1} (\mu , \nu) = \int_ {\mathbb {S} ^ {d - 1}} \int_ {- \infty} ^ {\infty} | F _ {\mu \boldsymbol {\theta}} (x) - \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {i} 1 _ {\langle \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l}, \boldsymbol {\theta} \rangle \leq x} | d x d \lambda (\boldsymbol {\theta}) \\ \leq \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {i} \int_ {- \infty} ^ {\infty} \left(\langle \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l}, \boldsymbol {\theta} \rangle \operatorname {e r f} \left(\frac {\langle \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l} , \boldsymbol {\theta} \rangle}{\sqrt {2}}\right) + \sqrt {\frac {2}{\pi}} \exp \left(- \frac {\langle \boldsymbol {h} _ {i} ^ {l} , \boldsymbol {\theta} \rangle^ {2}}{2}\right)\right) d \lambda (\boldsymbol {\theta}) = \mathcal {L} _ {p e r} (\nu_ {\mathrm {h}}) \tag {11} \\ \end{array}
$$

The use of  $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I})$  as the target can be motivated by the natural gradient (Amari, 1998) that enables parameter update to steepest descent direction in a Riemannian manifold. In addition to this, Roux et al. (2008) shows that the natural gradient direction corresponds to maximizing the probability of non-increasing generalization error. For gradient direction, natural gradient corrects the direction by multiplying the inverse Fisher information matrix  $F^{-1}$ . In Raiko et al. (2012) and Desjardins et al. (2015), under the independence assumption between forward and backward passes and activations of different layers, the Fisher information matrix is formulated as a block diagonal matrix each of which block is defined by:

$$
\boldsymbol {F} _ {l} = \mathbb {E} _ {(\boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {y}) \sim (\boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {y})} \left[ \frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \operatorname {v e c} (\boldsymbol {W} ^ {l})} \frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \operatorname {v e c} (\boldsymbol {W} ^ {l})} ^ {T} \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {x}} \left[ \boldsymbol {h} ^ {l - 1} \boldsymbol {h} ^ {l - 1} ^ {T} \right] \mathbb {E} _ {(\boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {y})} \left[ \frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \boldsymbol {a} ^ {l}} \frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \boldsymbol {a} ^ {l}} ^ {T} \right] \tag {12}
$$

where  $\operatorname{vec}(\boldsymbol{W}^l)$  is vectorized  $\boldsymbol{W}^l$ ,  $\boldsymbol{h}^{l-1} = f^{l-1}(\boldsymbol{x})$ , and  $\boldsymbol{a}^l = \boldsymbol{W}^l f^{l-1}(\boldsymbol{x}) + \boldsymbol{b}^l$  for  $\boldsymbol{x} \sim \mathbf{x}$ .

From the equation 12, it have been empirically shown that faster training and improved generalization performance through making  $\frac{1}{b}\sum_{i}h_{i}^{l}h_{i}^{lT}\approx I$  for making standard gradient to be close to natural gradient through zero mean and unit variance activations (LeCun et al., 1998; Schraudolph, 1998; Wiesler et al., 2014; Glorot & Bengio, 2010; Raiko et al., 2012) and decorrelated activations (Huang et al., 2018; Cogswell et al., 2015; Xiong et al., 2016). In this perspective, PER is expected to enjoy the same advantages by matching  $\nu_{\mathbf{h}^l}$  to  $\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ , thereby promoting  $\frac{1}{b}\sum_{i}h_{i}^{l}h_{i}^{lT}\approx I$ .

While the sliced Wasserstein in equation 10 and its gradient can be exactly computed, we work with its upper bound because it removes the sorting operations for evaluating the inverse CDF of empirical distribution. Therefore, it requires no computational cost for sorting and enables distributed and large-batch training by removing dependency of gradient computation on batch dimension.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

This section illustrates the effectiveness of PER through experiments on different benchmark tasks with various datasets and architectures. We compare PER with BN normalizing the first and second moments and VCL regularizing fourth moments. In addition, we also compare PER with  $L^1$  and  $L^2$  activation norm regularization which share similar behavior on certain areas in the projected space. Along with the benchmark experiments, we also analyze the impact of PER on the behavior of networks. Throughout all experiments, we use 256 number of slices for computation of PER and same regularization coefficient for activations in all layers.

# 4.1 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION IN CIFAR-10 AND CIFAR-100

We first evaluate PER in image classification task in CIFAR (Krizhevsky et al., 2009). We first evaluate PER with ResNet (He et al., 2016) in CIFAR-10. In this experiments, PER is compared with BN and vanilla networks initialized by fixup initialization (Zhang et al., 2019). We match the experimental details in training under BN with He et al. (2016) and under PER and vanilla with Zhang et al. (2019). Herein, we search the regularization coefficient over  $\{3\mathrm{e} - 4,1\mathrm{e} - 4,3\mathrm{e} - 5,1\mathrm{e} - 5\}$ . Table 1 presents the results of CIFAR-10 with ResNet-56 and ResNet-110. PER outperforms BN as well as vanilla networks in both architectures. Especially, PER improves the test errors by  $0.49\%$  and  $0.71\%$  in ResNet-56 and ResNet-110 without BN, respectively.

We also performed experiments with the deep ELU networks which examined in VCL Littwin & Wolf (2018). The deep ELU networks is a modified 11-layer CNN described in Clevert et al. (2015). Alongside of ELU, experiments with Leaky ReLU and ReLU are performend. We match the experimental settings in Littwin & Wolf (2018) except that we used  $10\mathrm{x}$  less learning rate for bias parameters and use of additional scalar bias after ReLU and Leaky ReLU based on Zhang et al. (2019). Again, we search the regularization coefficient over  $\{3\mathrm{e} - 4,1\mathrm{e} - 4,3\mathrm{e} - 5,1\mathrm{e} - 5\}$ . In the case of ReLU and Leaky ReLU in CIFAR-100, we search  $\{3\mathrm{e} - 6,1\mathrm{e} - 6,3\mathrm{e} - 7,1\mathrm{e} - 7\}$  because of divergence of training with PER in these setting. As shown in Table 2, PER shows best performance on four configurations among six configurations. In other cases, PER also results in comparable performance to BN or VCL giving at most  $0.16\%$  less than best performing method. Herein, we want to note that

the PER have no additional parameters unlike BN requiring parameters for each channel in every layer (2.5K total) and VCL requiring parameters for each location and channel in every layer (350K total).

# 4.2 LANGUAGE MODELING IN PTB AND WIKITEXT2

We evaluate PER in word-level language modeling task in PTB (Mikolov et al., 2010) and WikiText2 (Merit et al., 2016). We apply PER loss to LSTM with two layers having 650 hidden units with and without reuse embedding (RE) in Inan et al. (2016) and Press & Wolf (2016), and variational dropout (VD) in Gal & Ghahramani (2016). We used the same configurations with Merity et al. (2017) except clipping gradient at 0.25 instead of 10 and train for 60 epochs instead of 80. PER is compared with recurrent BN (RBN) because BN is not directly applicable to LSTM (Cooijmans et al., 2016). PER is also compared with  $L^1$  and  $L^2$  activation norm regularizations. Herein, the search space of regularization coefficient is {3e-4, 1e-4, 3e-5}. In the case of  $L^1$  and  $L^2$  penalties in PTB, we search additional hyperparameters {1e-5, 3e-6, 1e-6, 3e-6, 1e-6, 3e-7, 1e-7} because the searched coefficients seem to constrain the capacity.

We list in Table 3 the perplexity comparison of methods on PTB and WikiText2. While all regularization techniques show somewhat regularization effects by improving test perplexity, PER gives best test perplexity except LSTM and RE-LSTM in PTB dataset. We also note that naively applying RBN often reduce performance especially when VD is used unlike PER. For instance, RBN increase test perplexity of VD-LSTM by about 5 in PTB and WikiText2.

# 4.3 CLOSENESS TO THE STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTION.

To examine the effect of PER on the closeness to  $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I})$ , we investigate distributional characteristics of activations under PER in deep ELU networks used in the previous benchmark task. We first analyze distribution of  $\nu_{h_j^l} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i\delta_{h_{ij}^l}$  for some unit  $j$  and layer  $l$  (Fig. 3). In the analysis, BN shows somewhat stable distribution in a sense that distributional shift between two consecutive iterations due to the nature of normalization. On the contrary, activation distribution of vanilla method and PER result in somewhat noisy distributions. However, we observed that PER prevents explosion of variance and pushes the mean to zero. As shown in the Fig. 3, variances of  $\nu_{h_j^6}$  under PER and Vanilla are very high in the beginning of training. However, as training the network, the variance keeps decreasing towards one under PER. Similarly, biased means of  $\nu_{h_j^3}$  and  $\nu_{h_j^9}$  at early stage of learning are recovered under PER.

Since the distribution of single activation only captures the scalar,  $SW_{1}(\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}),\nu_{\mathbf{h}^{l}})$  is also examined (Fig. 4). Herein, the sliced Wasserstein distance is computed by approximating the Gaussian

measure using the empirical measure of samples drawn from  $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I})$  as in Rabin et al. (2011). As similar to the previous result, while normalization methods with initialization  $\beta_j^l = 0$  and  $l_{j} = 1$  can constrain activations close to  $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I})$  in the sliced Wasserstein metric sense, PER can also effectively control the distribution of activations without such normalization. This confirms that the regularization loss of PER prevents the distribution of activation from drifting away from the target distribution.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We proposed the regularization loss that minimizes the upper bound of the 1-Wasserstein distance between the standard normal distribution and the distribution of activations. PER differs from the existing methods that act on sample statistics rather than a distribution itself. Our experimental results in image classification and language modeling show that PER outperforms or shows a comparable performance to sample statistics based approaches (BN and VCL) as well as  $L^1$  and  $L^2$  activation norm regularization. The benchmark performances show the somewhat marginal but consistent regularization effects. The analysis on activations' distribution during training verifies that PER can stabilize probability distribution of activation without normalization techniques. Considering that the regularization loss can be easily applied to a wide range of tasks without changing architectures or training strategies unlike BN, we believe that the results indicate the valuable potential of regularizing networks in the probability distribution space as a future direction of research.

The idea of regularizing activations with metric in probability distribution space can be extended to many useful applications encoding task-specific priors. For instance, one can investigate the Laplace distribution to promote sparsity activation behavior. In addition, the empirical distribution of pretrained networks can be used as the target distribution. For instance, to prevent catastrophic forgetting, activation distribution can be regularized so that it does not drift away from the activation distribution from the previous tasks unlike constraining the weight updates in parameter  $l_{2}$  space (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) or in function  $L^{2}$  space (Benjamin et al., 2018).
