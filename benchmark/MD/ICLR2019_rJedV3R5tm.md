# ABSTRACT

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved great success at generating realistic images. However, the text generation still remains a challenging task for modern GAN architectures. In this work, we propose RelGAN, a new GAN architecture for text generation, consisting of three main components: a relational memory based generator for the long-distance dependency modeling, the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for training GANs on discrete data, and multiple embedded representations in the discriminator to provide a more informative signal for the generator updates. Our experiments show that RelGAN outperforms current state-of-the-art models in terms of sample quality and diversity, and we also reveal via ablation studies that each component of RelGAN contributes critically to its performance improvements. Moreover, a key advantage of our method, that distinguishes it from other GANs, is the ability to control the trade-off between sample quality and diversity via the use of a single adjustable parameter. Finally, RelGAN is the first architecture that makes GANs with Gumbel-Softmax relaxation succeed in generating realistic text.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) were originally designed to generate continuous data and have achieved a lot of success at generating continuous samples, such as images. Recently, GANs were extended to generate discrete data, in particular text sequences (Kusner & Hernández-Lobato, 2016; Yu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017; Fedus et al., 2018). However, this extension is not straightforward. The main issue is that outputs of GANs for the discrete data generation are not differentiable and thus the standard gradient-based techniques cannot be applied directly in these settings. To overcome this, most state-of-the-art GANs have used the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992) and its variants that originate from the reinforcement learning (RL) community to train the generator while the discriminator is still a classifier to discriminate real and generated text and provides reward signals for the generator updates. A detailed description of the related work is deferred to Appendix A.

Although these state-of-the-art GANs have shown some promising results in text generation as compared to the conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, they also suffer from some fundamental issues, including training instability and mode collapse. First, their performance is quite sensitive to random parameter initializations and hyperparameter choices (Semeniuta et al., 2018). Moreover, many GANs heavily employ RL heuristics, such as Monte Carlo search (Yu et al., 2017) and hierarchical RL (Guo et al., 2017), making the already difficult-to-train GANs more complicated and thus the individual role of adversarial training unclear. The second issue is mode collapse as the generated text sentences tend to be less diverse (Semeniuta et al., 2018; Fedus et al., 2018) and it becomes more severe when generating longer sentences. The mode collapse issue can be caused either by a lack of expressive power in the generator (since it may not be capable of covering many more complex modes in data distribution), or by a less informative guiding signal in the discriminator (as it may constrain the generator updates to within certain modes).

In this work, we propose a new GAN architecture - Relational GAN (RelGAN), whose design is motivated by the issues identified above. The RelGAN architecture mainly consists of three parts: 1) a relational memory (Santoro et al., 2018) based generator, which promises more expressive power and better ability of modeling longer-range dependencies in text; 2) Gumbel-Softmax relaxation

(Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016) for training GANs on discrete data, which simplifies our model, enabling us to stay within a classical GAN framework without intensive RL heuristics; 3) multiple embedded representations in the discriminator, enabling a more diverse and informative signal for the generator updates. We experimentally demonstrate that RelGAN outperforms most current models in terms of sample quality and diversity. Furthermore, we show via ablation studies that each part of RelGAN plays an important role in its performance improvements. A key advantage of our method, that distinguishes it from other GANs, is the ability to control the trade-off between sample quality and diversity, via the use of a single adjustable parameter. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, RelGAN is the first architecture to demonstrate that GANs with Gumbel-Softmax relaxation are capable of generating realistic text.

# 2.1 RELATIONAL MEMORY BASED GENERATOR

Current dominant GANs for text generation, such as Kusner & Hernández-Lobato (2016); Yu et al. (2017); Lin et al. (2017); Guo et al. (2017); Fedus et al. (2018) are built using LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) as the generator architecture. However, the LSTM-based generator might be the bottleneck of GANs from the following experimental observations: 1) The discriminator's loss value very quickly goes to near its minimum after few iterations of adversarial training. It means that the discriminator may be much more powerful than the generator and can easily distinguish between real and fake samples. 2) Mode collapse in current GANs (Fedus et al., 2018) may also partly indicate the incapacity of generator, as it may not be expressive enough to fit all the modes of data distribution. 3) Current GANs perform poorly at long sentence generation (Guo et al., 2017), and we know that LSTM packs all information about the previous text sequences into a common hidden vector, potentially limiting its ability of modeling the long-distance dependency.

Therefore, we propose to use the more powerful module - relational memory (Santoro et al., 2018) - as the generator architecture for text generation. The basic idea of relational memory is to consider a fixed set of memory slots (e.g. memory matrix) and allow for interactions between memory slots by using the self-attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017). The empirical findings by Santoro et al. (2018) showed that relational memory performs better in the language modeling compared to LSTM. Intuitively, the use of multiple memory slots and the attention across these memories can increase the expressive power of generator and its ability of generating longer text sentences.

Formally, we assume each row of the memory  $M_{t}$  represents a memory slot and Figure 1 shows how self-attention updates  $M_{t}$  by incorporating new observation  $x_{t}$  at time  $t$ . Given  $H$  heads, we have  $H$  sets of queries, keys and values via three linear transformations, respectively: For each head, we get query  $Q_{t}^{(h)} = M_{t}W_{q}^{(h)}$ , key  $K_{t}^{(h)} = [M_{t};x_{t}]W_{k}^{(h)}$  and value  $V_{t}^{(h)} = [M_{t};x_{t}]W_{v}^{(h)}$  where  $[]$  denotes the row-wise concatenation. Thus, the updated memory  $\tilde{M}_{t + 1}$  is given by

$$
\tilde {M} _ {t + 1} = \left[ \tilde {M} _ {t + 1} ^ {(1)}: \dots : \tilde {M} _ {t + 1} ^ {(H)} \right], \quad \tilde {M} _ {t + 1} ^ {(h)} = \sigma \left(\frac {M _ {t} W _ {q} ^ {(h)} ([ M _ {t} ; x _ {t} ] W _ {k} ^ {(h)}) ^ {T}}{\sqrt {d _ {k}}}\right) [ M _ {t}; x _ {t} ] W _ {v} ^ {(h)} \tag {1}
$$

where  $\sigma(\cdot)$  denotes the softmax function which is performed on each row,  $d_k$  is the column dimension of the key  $K_t^{(h)}$  and  $[\cdot]$  denotes the column-wise concatenation.

By following the same idea of Santoro et al. (2018), the next memory  $M_{t + 1}$  and output (logits)  $o_t$  of the generator at time  $t$  are given by

$$
M _ {t + 1} = f _ {\theta_ {1}} \left(\tilde {M} _ {t + 1}, M _ {t}\right), o _ {t} = f _ {\theta_ {2}} \left(\tilde {M} _ {t + 1}, M _ {t}\right) \tag {2}
$$

respectively, where the two parametrized functions  $f_{\theta_1}$  and  $f_{\theta_2}$  are combinations of skip connections, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), gated operations and/or pre-softmax linear transformations.

# 2.2 TRAINING WITH DISCRETE DATA

# 2.2.1 GUMBEL-SOFTMAX RELAXATION

Before the introduction of Gumbel-Softmax relaxation, we first show why training GANs with discrete data is a critical issue. Assuming the vocabulary size is  $V$ , for the output logits  $o_{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{V}$  of the generator in (2), the next generated one-hot token  $y_{t + 1} \in \mathbb{R}^{V}$  will be obtained by sampling:

$$
y _ {t + 1} \sim \sigma \left(o _ {t}\right) \tag {3}
$$

![](images/6f12f8dc0e24a2131b06bc71adc37363438372f173e55f2f74c776fc0bcd3405.jpg)  
Figure 1: The self-attention mechanism for updating the memory from  $M_t$  to  $\tilde{M}_{t+1}$  by incorporating new observation  $x_t$ , where each row of the memory matrix  $M_t$  is a memory slot, and  $Q_t^{(h)}$ ,  $K_t^{(h)}$ , and  $V_t^{(h)}$  denote the queries, keys and values, respectively. Note that the softmax function is performed on each row, and  $\otimes$  denotes the dot product. The concatenation (denoted by "concat") of  $M_t$  and  $x_t$  is row-wise where the embedded input is first passed through a linear layer to make  $x_t$  match the row dimension of  $M_t$ .

where similarly  $\sigma(\cdot)$  denotes the softmax function which is performed on  $o_t$  element-wisely and we use  $\sigma(o_t)$  to represent the multinomial distribution on the set of all possible tokens. As we know, the sampling operations in (3) on the multinomial distribution of the generator output are not differentiable, i.e.,  $\frac{\partial y_{t+1}}{\partial \theta_G} = 0$  a.e. for  $t = 0, \dots, T-1$  where  $\theta_G$  denotes the generator parameters. By chain rule, the gradients of the generator loss  $l_G$  w.r.t.  $\theta_G$  will be

$$
\frac {\partial l _ {G}}{\partial \theta_ {G}} = \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {T - 1} \frac {\partial y _ {t + 1}}{\partial \theta_ {G}} \frac {\partial l _ {G}}{\partial y _ {t + 1}} = 0 a. e. \tag {4}
$$

So the gradients of the generator loss cannot pass back to the generator via the discriminator. This is the notorious "non-differentiability issue" of GANs in discrete data generation.

To deal with the non-differentiability issue, we apply the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation technique which defines a continuous distribution over the simplex that can approximate samples from a categorical distribution (Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016). Formally, the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation includes two parts: 1) The Gumbel-Max trick. According to Jang et al. (2016); Maddison et al. (2016), the sampling in (3) can be reparametrized as

$$
y _ {t + 1} = \operatorname {o n e} \text {h o t} \left(\arg \max  _ {1 \leq i \leq V} \left(o _ {t} ^ {(i)} + g _ {t} ^ {(i)}\right)\right) \tag {5}
$$

where  $o_{t}^{(i)}$  denotes the  $i$ -th entry of  $o_{t}$  and  $g_{t}^{(i)}$  is from the i.i.d. standard Gumbel distribution, i.e.  $g_{t}^{(i)} = -\log (-\log U_{t}^{(i)})$  with  $U_{t}^{(i)} \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$ . 2) Relaxing the discreteness. As the arg max operation in (5) is still non-differentiable, we need further approximate the "one-hot with arg max" by softmax, which yields

$$
\hat {y} _ {t + 1} = \sigma \left(\beta \left(o _ {t} + g _ {t}\right)\right) \tag {6}
$$

where  $\beta > 0$  is a tunable parameter called inverse temperature. As  $\hat{y}_{t+1}$  in (6) is differentiable with respect to  $o_t$ , we can use  $\hat{y}_{t+1}$  instead of the one-hot token  $y_{t+1}$  as the input of the discriminator. Also, note that the new observation  $x_{t+1}$  of the generator to be concatenated with  $M_{t+1}$  in next time  $t+1$  is given by  $x_{t+1} = f_{\theta_3}(y_{t+1})$ , where the parametrized function  $f_{\theta_3}$  is composed of an embedding layer that maps  $y_{t+1}$  to an embedded input and a linear layer that makes  $x_{t+1}$  match the row dimension of  $M_{t+1}$  (the embedded input and the linear layer are shown in Figure 1).

# 2.2.2 TEMPERATURE CONTROL

With the larger inverse temperature  $\beta$ ,  $\hat{y}_{t+1}$  in (6) will become a better approximation of  $y_{t+1}$  in (3) and asymptotically as  $\beta \to \infty$ ,  $\hat{y}_{t+1} \to y_{t+1}$ . However, the issue is that the variance of gradients will be very large as we have  $\mathrm{Var}\left(\frac{\partial \hat{y}_{t+1}}{\partial o_t}\right) \propto \beta^2$ , and thus the parameter updates will become very sensitive to the input noise. Intuitively, this might cause poor sample quality. On the other hand, with the smaller inverse temperature  $\beta$ , the generator will pay more attention to making a sharp distribution of entries in  $\hat{y}_{i+1}$  due to the larger (initial) approximation gap between  $\hat{y}_{t+1}$  and  $y_{t+1}$ , which implicitly discourages its possible "exploration". Intuitively, this might cause mode collapse.

Therefore, the larger  $\beta$  encourages more exploration for better sample diversity while the smaller  $\beta$  encourages more exploitation for better sample quality. We thus propose to increase the inverse tem

Figure 2: The proposed discriminator framework with multiple embedded representations. The input is either the real sentence  $[r_1:\dots :r_T]$  where  $r_t$  denotes the  $t$ -th one-hot token, or the generated (approximate) sentence  $[\hat{y}_1:\dots :\hat{y}_T]$  where  $\hat{y}_t$  is from (6). Also,  $S$  embedding matrices  $\{W_e^{(s)}\}_{s = 1}^S$  map each input into  $S$  embedded representations, each of which is passed through discriminator independently to get the related loss. Note that "D" is the CNN-based classifier  $D(\cdot)\in \mathbb{R}$  with weight-sharing and  $\oplus$  denotes taking the average.

perature  $\beta$  over iterations via an exponential policy:  $\beta_{n} = \beta_{\mathrm{max}}^{n / N}$ , where  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}}$  denotes the maximum inverse temperature,  $N$  is the maximum number of training iterations and  $n$  denotes the current iteration. In the exponential policy, as the increase rate of inverse temperature depends on  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}}$ ,  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}}$  will decide the transition time from the exploitation phase to the exploration phase. In such sense, RelGAN provides a flexibility of either generating more diverse samples with a large  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}}$  or generating better quality samples with a small  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}}$  while most current GANs cannot provide.

# 2.3 MULTIPLE REPRESENTATIONS IN DISCRIMINATOR

A commonly used discriminator for text generation is a CNN-based classifier (Kim, 2014) that employs a convolutional layer with multiple filters of different sizes to capture relations of various word lengths and a max-pooling layer over the entire input sentence for each feature map (Yu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017). In this discriminator architecture, the input of the CNN-based classifier is a sentence of length  $T$  represented by a single embedded matrix  $\tilde{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times T}$  where each column  $\tilde{x}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$  is a  $d$ -dimensional embedded vector of each word.

In this work, we propose a new discriminator framework that applies multiple embedded representations for each sentence, with each representation independently passed through the above CNN-based classifier to get an individual score. The average of these individual scores will serve as the final guiding information to update the generator. Our hypothesis is that each embedded representation may capture a specific aspect of the input sentence and the discriminator which compares real and generated sentences from these different perspectives can provide more diverse and comprehensive guiding information for the generator updates. This idea resembles the use of multiple discriminators to improve GANs on image generation (Durugkar et al., 2016), but the difference is that we only use multiple different representations of the input while still keeping a single or weight-sharing CNN-based classifier, which presumably has much less computational cost.

Formally, we assume that  $r_t$  denotes the  $t$ -th one-hot real token and  $\hat{y}_t$  from (6) denotes the  $t$ -th softmax-like generated token, and Figure 2 shows the proposed discriminator framework with multiple embedded representations where either the real input  $[r_1: \dots: r_T] \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times T}$  or the generated input  $[\hat{y}_1: \dots: \hat{y}_T] \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times T}$  will be mapped into  $S$  embedded representations by  $S$  distinct embedding matrices  $\{W_e^{(s)}\}_{s=1}^S$  with  $W_e^{(s)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times V}$ . Let  $\tilde{X}_r^{(s)}$  and  $\tilde{X}_y^{(s)}$  be the  $s$ -th embedded representation of the real and generated input, respectively. Thus, we have

$$
\tilde {X} _ {r} ^ {(s)} = W _ {e} ^ {(s)} \left[ r _ {1}: \dots : r _ {T} \right], \quad \tilde {X} _ {y} ^ {(s)} = W _ {e} ^ {(s)} \left[ \hat {y} _ {1}: \dots : \hat {y} _ {T} \right] \tag {7}
$$

and the final discriminator loss is given by

$$
l _ {D} = \frac {1}{S} \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {S} \mathbb {E} _ {\substack {r _ {1: T} \sim P _ {r} \\ \hat {y} _ {1: T} \sim P _ {\theta}}} f (D (\tilde {X} _ {r} ^ {(s)}), D (\tilde {X} _ {y} ^ {(s)})) \tag{8}
$$

where the expectation is taken w.r.t. both real sentence distribution  $P_r$  and generated sentence distribution  $P_{\theta}$ , and the loss function  $f$  is determined by the specific GAN loss, such as vanilla GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014),  $f$ -GAN (Nowozin et al., 2016) and WGAN (Arjovsky et al., 2017). Throughout this paper, the generator loss can be simply set to be  $l_G = -l_D$ .

# 2.4 TRAINING TECHNIQUES

Choice of Loss Function. Empirically, we first compared three different standard GAN losses: standard GAN (the non-saturating version) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), hinge loss (Nowozin et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018) and Relativistic standard GAN (RSGAN) (Jolicoeur-Martineau, 2018) on the synthetic data (shown in next section) and then chose the best one - RSGAN for the rest of all experiments. Note that it does not mean RelGAN only works with the RSGAN loss and please see Appendix C for training curves of RelGAN with different loss functions. Formally, the function  $f$  in (8) for RSGAN is  $f(a,b) = \log \operatorname{sigmoid}(a - b)$  for  $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ , and thus (8) becomes

$$
l _ {D} = \frac {1}{S} \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {S} \mathbb {E} _ {\substack {r _ {1: T} \sim P _ {r} \\ \hat {y} _ {1: T} \sim P _ {\theta}}} \log \operatorname {sigmoid}(D (\tilde {X} _ {r} ^ {(s)}) - D (\tilde {X} _ {y} ^ {(s)})) \tag{9}
$$

Intuitively, the loss function in (9) is to directly estimate the average probability that real sentences are more realistic than generated sentences in terms of different embedded representations.

Generator Pre-training. Most current GANs for text generation need the pre-training for both generator and discriminator, such as SeqGAN (Yu et al., 2017), and some may further heavily rely on the exclusive pre-training techniques, such as TextGAN (Zhang et al., 2017), LeakGAN (Guo et al., 2017) and MaskGAN (Fedus et al., 2018). Instead, the proposed RelGAN only need to pre-train the generator simply via the standard MLE training for several epochs before starting the adversarial training. Experimentally, we find that a good initialization for generator provided by the MLE pre-training is necessary for a good convergence behavior of adversarial training.

# 3 EXPERIMENTS

We test RelGAN on both synthetic and real data, where the synthetic data are 10,000 discrete sequences generated by an oracle-LSTM with fixed parameters (Yu et al., 2017) and the real data include the COCO image captions (Chen et al., 2015) and EMNLP2017 WMT News, first used by Guo et al. (2017) for text generation. The experimental settings are given in Appendix B.

Evaluation Metrics. How to properly evaluate generative models remains an open research question (Theis et al., 2015; Semeniuta et al., 2018). The key issue plaging current evaluation metrics for GANs is that they cannot measure sample quality and sample diversity simultaneously. Therefore, we use two distinct metrics: for synthetic data, we use both negative log-likelihood (called  $\mathrm{NLL}_{\mathrm{gen}}$ ) and its counterpart (called  $\mathrm{NLL}_{\mathrm{oracle}}$ ), defined as:

$$
\mathrm {N L L} _ {\text {g e n}} = - \mathbb {E} _ {r _ {1: T} \sim P _ {r}} \log P _ {\theta} \left(r _ {1}, \dots , r _ {T}\right), \quad \mathrm {N L L} _ {\text {o r a c l e}} = - \mathbb {E} _ {y _ {1: T} \sim P _ {\theta}} \log P _ {r} \left(y _ {1}, \dots , y _ {T}\right), \tag {10}
$$

where the generated sentence distribution  $P_{\theta}$  and the real sentence distribution  $P_{r}$  are both known by evaluating the generator and oracle-LSTM, respectively. Generally, NLL<sub>gen</sub> measures sample diversity while NLL<sub>oracle</sub> is more sensitive to sample quality (Theis et al., 2015; Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017). For the real dataset, we also apply NLL<sub>gen</sub> to measure the sample diversity, similar to Lu et al. (2018). However, since NLL<sub>oracle</sub> cannot be evaluated without an oracle, we instead apply the commonly-used BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) to measure the sample quality and compare with the MLE baseline, along with other start-of-the-art GANs, including SeqGAN (Yu et al., 2017), RankGAN (Lin et al., 2017) and LeakGAN (Guo et al., 2017). Note that for BLEU score evaluation, we follow the strategy in (Yu et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018) by using the test data as the reference.

# 3.1 SYNTHETIC DATA

We run the synthetic data experiments with sequence length 20 and 40, respectively. The NLL_oracle results of RelGAN and other models are shown in Table 1 where we set  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 1$  for length 20 and  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 2$  for length 40. We can see that RelGAN outperforms other models in both cases, and its lead in performance becomes larger with longer sequence length, demonstrating the log-distance dependency modeling ability of the proposed generator.

We also evaluate the trade-off between sample quality and diversity as a function of the maximum inverse temperature  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}}$  and the results are shown in Figure 3. As  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}}$  increases,  $\mathrm{NLL}_{\mathrm{gen}}$  decreases, which implies better sample diversity, but  $\mathrm{NLL}_{\mathrm{oracle}}$  increases, which implies worse sample quality. Especially when  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} \in \{10, 100\}$ , the best  $\mathrm{NLL}_{\mathrm{gen}}$  score of 4.4 for RelGAN is very close to the best  $\mathrm{NLL}_{\mathrm{gen}}$  score of 4.2 for MLE pre-training, implying that RelGAN with a sufficiently large inverse temperature suffers little mode collapse on synthetic data.

# 3.2 COCO IMAGE CAPTIONS DATASET

In order to test RelGAN on real-world data, we first run experiments using the COCO Image Captions dataset. By applying the same preprocessing as in LeakGAN (Guo et al., 2017), the dataset includes 4,682 unique words with the maximum sentence length 37. Both the training and test data contain 10,000 text sentences.

Table 1: The NLLoracle scores on synthetic data where  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 1$  for length 20 and  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 2$  for length 40. RelGAN is run with 6 random seeds and the final score is obtained by taking the average of scores, and other scores are from their original papers and Guo et al. (2017). Note that "Real" denotes the real data generated by the oracle-LSTM. For the NLLoracle score, the lower the better.

Table 2: The BLEU and  $\mathrm{NLL}_{\mathrm{gen}}$  scores on COCO Image Captions where  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 100$  and 1000, respectively. RelGAN is run with 6 random seeds and the final score is obtained by taking the average of scores, and other scores are based on the same evaluation settings in Zhu et al. (2018). For BLEU scores, the higher the better.

The BLEU scores of RelGAN compared with previous models are shown in Table 2 where we set  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 100$  and 1000, respectively. We can see that RelGAN is significantly and consistently better than other models in terms of all the BLEU scores, which means its ability of generating high-quality sentences of COCO Image Captions. Furthermore, the NLL<sub>gen</sub> scores of RelGAN and previous models are also shown in Table 2, where RelGAN also achieves the state-of-the-art results in terms of sample diversity. For example, we do not see obvious mode collapse with  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 1000$  by looking at the generated samples (see Appendix D for more details).

# 3.3 EMNLP2017 WMT NEWS DATASET

The EMNLP2017 WMT News dataset consists of 5,255 unique words with the maximum sentence length 51 after applying the same preprocessing as in LeakGAN (Guo et al., 2017). Similarly, both the training and test data contain 10,000 sentences.

The BLEU scores of RelGAN compared with previous models are shown in Table 3 where we set  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 100$  and 1000, respectively. We can see that RelGAN also consistently outperforms

Our model is run with 6 random seeds and the final score is obtained by taking the average of scores, and other scores are based on the same evaluation settings in Zhu et al. (2018).

previous models in terms of all the BLEU scores, demonstrating its ability of generating high-quality sentences on EMNLP2017 WMT News. Moreover, the sample diversity metric  $\mathrm{NLL}_{\mathrm{gen}}$  scores of RelGAN and previous models are also shown in Table 3. Similarly, RelGAN achieves the state-of-the-art results in terms of sample diversity. Upon visually examining generated samples (See Appendix E for more details), we do not observe obvious mode collapse for  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} \in \{100, 1000\}$ .

Finally, from Tables 2 and 3, we can see that the sample quality and diversity trade-off with different values of maximum inverse temperature  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}}$  also exists on the real data. That is, RelGAN with  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 100$  achieves better sample quality while RelGAN with  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 1000$  achieves better sample diversity. Depending on what the underlying applications of text generation via RelGAN are, we can adjust  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}}$  properly to get either better quality or better diversity.

# 3.4 ABLATION STUDY

# 3.4.1 IMPACT OF RELATIONAL MEMORY

To show the impact of relational memory in RelGAN, we propose to replace relational memory by LSTM-32 and LSTM-512 as the generator architecture, respectively, and see how the performance differs. Here LSTM- $k$  represents the LSTM with hidden dimension being  $k$ . We choose  $k = 32$  because most previous GANs (Yu et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017) have used this architecture for text generation, and also choose  $k = 512$  because for more fair comparison, we want to keep the total memory size of LSTM to be the same with the relational memory we have used.

The results on the COCO Image Captions dataset are shown in Figure 4 (Left), where we provide the BLEU-4 score (See Appendix F for all the BLEU scores). We can see that the BLEU scores of relational memory are consistently better than those of LSTM-32 and LSTM-512, which demonstrates the advantages of using relational memory as generator in RelGAN.

# 3.4.2 IMPACT OF GUMBEL-SOFTMAX RELAXATION

To show the impact of Gumbel-Softmax relaxation in RelGAN, we can instead apply the vanilla REINFORCE method to deal with the non-differentiable issue of RelGAN on text generation. In

this experiment, we keep all other hyperparameters in RelGAN fixed and compare the performance of Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the vanilla REINFORCE method.

The results are shown in Figure 4 (Right), where the BLEU-2 score is provided (See Appendix G for all the BLEU scores). We can see that under the proposed RelGAN framework, Gumbel-Softmax relaxation performs much better than the vanilla REINFORCE method. During experiments, we find that the variance of generator gradients in the vanilla REINFORCE method is too large to provide any useful update for generator, which may explain why the performance of vanilla REINFORCE does not improve after the pre-training, as observed in Figure 4 (Right). The exploration of various variance reduction techniques for the REINFORCE method in RelGAN is out of scope of this paper.

# 3.4.3 IMPACT OF MULTIPLE REPRESENTATIONS IN DISCRIMINATOR

To show the impact of multiple embedded representations in discriminator while keeping the expressive power of discriminator the same for fair comparison, we propose to apply  $S$  embedded presentations with each embedded vector of length  $d = \frac{d_{\max}}{S}$  where  $d_{\max}$  denotes the total length of representations. In this experiment, we set  $d_{\max} = 64$ , and thus for instance, if  $S = 1$  then  $d = 64$  for each embedded vector, and if  $S = 2$  then  $d = 32$  for each embedded vector, and so on.

Figure 5: (Left) The best NLLoracle score on the synthetic data varies with different number of embedded presentations  $S = \{1,2,4,8,16,32,64\}$  where  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 10$ . (Right) The training curves of BLEU-3 score on COCO Image Captions with the number of embedded representations  $S = 1$  and  $S = 64$ , respectively, where  $\beta_{\mathrm{max}} = 1000$ . All results are obtained by taking the average of 6 runs with different random seeds.

We first test RelGAN on the synthetic data with  $S \in \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\}$  and the results are shown in Figure 5 (Left). We can see that as the number of embedded representations  $S$  increases, the best NLL<sub>oracle</sub> score tends to keep decreasing, yielding better sample quality. Furthermore, we test RelGAN on COCO Image Captions with  $S \in \{1, 64\}$  and the BLEU-3 score is shown in Figure 5 (Right). Still, we can see that the BLEU scores of RelGAN with  $S = 64$  are consistently better than those of RelGAN with  $S = 1$  (see Appendix H for all the BLEU scores). Note that in both experiments, we do not see an obvious sign of mode collapse with varying number of representations. For example, the NLL<sub>gen</sub> score on the synthetic data stays around 4.4 for different values of  $S$  (close to the best NLL<sub>gen</sub> 4.2 for MLE shown in Figure 3 (Left)). Thus, these experiments demonstrate the advantages of using multiple embedded representations for discriminator in RelGAN.

# 4 CONCLUSIONS

We proposed a new GAN architecture called RelGAN for text generation, that outperforms most current models in terms of sample quality and diversity on both synthetic and real data. Furthermore, the trade-off between the generated sample diversity and quality can be adjusted properly in RelGAN by controlling the inverse temperature. In RelGAN, we used the relational memory based generator to improve its ability of modeling long distance dependencies and also applied multiple embedded representations in discriminator such that it can provide more diverse and informative guiding signal for generator. By applying Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to deal with the non-differentiable issue, our architecture is simple to implement without employing intensive RL heuristics. For the future directions, since we have demonstrated that GANs with Gumbel-Softmax relaxation is very promising for text generation, we would like to explore further in this direction. For example, it is interesting to make RelGAN work better without any pre-training. Also, extending RelGAN to a conditional model for many text generation related applications is another interesting direction.
