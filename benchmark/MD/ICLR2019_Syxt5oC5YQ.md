# ABSTRACT

Momentum is a simple and widely used trick which allows gradient-based optimizers to pick up speed along low curvature directions. Its performance depends crucially on a damping coefficient  $\beta$ . Large  $\beta$  values can potentially deliver much larger speedups, but are prone to oscillations and instability; hence one typically resorts to small values such as 0.5 or 0.9. We propose Aggregated Momentum (AggMo), a variant of momentum which combines multiple velocity vectors with different  $\beta$  parameters. AggMo is trivial to implement, but significantly dampens oscillations, enabling it to remain stable even for aggressive  $\beta$  values such as 0.999. We reinterpret Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent as a special case of AggMo and analyze rates of convergence for quadratic objectives. Empirically, we find that AggMo is a suitable drop-in replacement for other momentum methods, and frequently delivers faster convergence with little to no tuning.

In spite of a wide range of modern optimization research, gradient descent with momentum and its variants remain the tool of choice in machine learning. Momentum methods can help the optimizer pick up speed along low curvature directions without becoming unstable in high-curvature directions. The simplest of these methods, classical momentum (Polyak, 1964), has an associated damping coefficient,  $0 \leq \beta < 1$ , which controls how quickly the momentum vector decays. The choice of  $\beta$  imposes a tradeoff between speed and stability: in directions where the gradient is small but consistent, the terminal velocity is proportional to  $1/(1 - \beta)$ , suggesting that  $\beta$  slightly less than 1 could deliver much improved optimization performance. However, large  $\beta$  values are prone to oscillations and instability (O'Donoghue & Candes, 2015; Goh, 2017), requiring a smaller learning rate and hence slower convergence.

Finding a way to dampen the oscillations while preserving the high terminal velocity of large beta values could dramatically speed up optimization. Sutskever et al. (2013) found that Nesterov accelerated gradient descent (Nesterov, 1983), which they reinterpreted as a momentum method, was more stable than classical momentum for large  $\beta$  values and gave substantial speedups for training neural networks. However, the reasons for the improved performance remain somewhat mysterious. O'Donoghue & Candes (2015) proposed to detect oscillations and eliminate them by resetting the velocity vector to zero. But in practice it is difficult to determine an appropriate restart condition.

In this work, we introduce Aggregated Momentum (AggMo), a variant of classical momentum which maintains several velocity vectors with different  $\beta$  parameters. AggMo averages the velocity vectors when updating the parameters. We find that this combines the advantages of both small and large  $\beta$  values: the large values allow significant buildup of velocity along low curvature directions, while the small values dampen the oscillations, hence stabilizing the algorithm. AggMo is trivial to implement and incurs almost no computational overhead.

We draw inspiration from the physics literature when we refer to our method as a form of passive damping. Resonance occurs when a system is driven at specific frequencies but may be prevented through careful design (Goldstein, 2011). Passive damping can address this in structures by making use of different materials with unique resonant frequencies. This prevents any single frequency from producing catastrophic resonance. By combining several momentum velocities together we achieve a similar effect — no single frequency is driving the system and so oscillation is prevented.

In this paper we analyze rates of convergence on quadratic functions. We also provide theoretical convergence analysis showing that AggMo achieves converging average regret in online convex programming (Zinkevich, 2003). To evaluate AggMo empirically we compare against other commonly used optimizers on a range of deep learning architectures: deep autoencoders, convolutional networks, and long-term short-term memory (LSTM).

In all of these cases, we find that AggMo works as a drop-in replacement for classical momentum, in the sense that it works at least as well for a given  $\beta$  parameter. But due to its stability at higher  $\beta$  values, it often delivers substantially faster convergence than both classical and Nesterov momentum when its maximum  $\beta$  value is tuned.

# 2 Background: momentum-based optimization

Classical momentum We consider a function  $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$  to be minimized with respect to some variable  $\theta$ . Classical momentum (CM) minimizes this function by taking some initial point  $\theta_0$  and running the following iterative scheme,

$$
\mathbf {v} _ {t} = \beta \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1} - \nabla_ {\theta} f (\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1}) \tag {1}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t} = \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \gamma_ {t} \mathbf {v} _ {t}
$$

where  $\gamma_{t}$  denotes a learning rate schedule,  $\beta$  is the damping coefficient and we set  $\mathbf{v}_0 = 0$ . Momentum can speed up convergence but it is often difficult to choose the right damping coefficient,  $\beta$ . Even with momentum, progress in a low curvature direction may be very slow. If the damping coefficient is increased to overcome this then high curvature directions may cause instability and oscillations.

Nesterov momentum Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (Nesterov, 1983; 2013) is a modified version of the gradient descent algorithm with improved convergence and stability. It can be written as a momentum-based method (Sutskever et al., 2013),

$$
\mathbf {v} _ {t} = \beta \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1} - \nabla_ {\theta} f \left(\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \gamma_ {t - 1} \boldsymbol {\beta} \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1}\right) \tag {2}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t} = \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \gamma_ {t} \mathbf {v} _ {t}
$$

Nesterov momentum seeks to solve stability issues by correcting the error made after moving in the direction of the velocity,  $\mathbf{v}$ . In fact, it can be shown that for a quadratic function Nesterov momentum adapts to the curvature by effectively rescaling the damping coefficients by the eigenvalues of the quadratic (Sutskever et al., 2013).

Quadratic convergence We begin by studying convergence on quadratic functions, which have been an important test case for analyzing convergence behavior (Sutskever et al., 2013; O'Donoghue & Candes, 2015; Goh, 2017), and which can be considered a proxy for optimization behavior near a local minimum (O'Donoghue & Candes, 2015).

We analyze the behavior of these optimizers along the eigenvectors of a quadratic function in Figure 1. In the legend,  $\lambda$  denotes the corresponding eigenvalue. In (a) we use a low damping coefficient  $(\beta = 0.9)$  while (b) shows a high damping coefficient  $(\beta = 0.999)$ . When using a low damping coefficient it takes many iterations to find the optimal solution. On the other hand, increasing the damping coefficient from 0.9 to 0.999 causes oscillations which prevent convergence. When using CM in practice we seek the critical damping coefficient which allows us to rapidly approach the optimum without becoming unstable (Goh, 2017). On the other hand, Nesterov momentum with  $\beta = 0.999$  is able to converge more quickly within high curvature regions than CM but retains oscillations for the quadratics exhibiting lower curvature.

# 3 Passive damping through Aggregated Momentum

Aggregated Momentum We propose Aggregated Momentum (AggMo), a variant of gradient descent which aims to improve stability while providing the convergence benefits of larger damping coefficients. We modify the gradient descent algorithm by including several velocity vectors each with their own damping coefficient. At each optimization step these velocities are updated and then averaged to produce the final velocity used to update the parameters. This updated iterative procedure can be written as follows,

$$
\mathbf {v} _ {t} ^ {(i)} = \beta^ {(i)} \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1} ^ {(i)} - \nabla_ {\theta} f (\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1}), \text {f o r a l l} i
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t} = \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \frac {\gamma_ {t}}{K} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {K} \mathbf {v} _ {t} ^ {(i)} \tag {3}
$$

AggMo Velocities During Optimization of Quadratic  
Figure 2: Breaking oscillations with passive damping. The arrows show the direction and relative amplitude of the velocities at various points in time. We discuss points (1) and (2) in Section 3.

where  $\mathbf{v}_0^{(i)} = 0$  for each  $i$ . We refer to the vector  $\beta = [\beta^{(1)},\dots,\beta^{(K)}]$  as the damping vector.

By taking advantage of several damping coefficients, AggMo is able to optimize well over ill-conditioned curvature. Figure 1 (d) shows the optimization along the eigenvectors of a quadratic function using AggMo. AggMo dampens oscillations quickly for all eigenvalues and converges faster than CM and Nesterov in this case.

In Figure 2 we display the AggMo velocities during optimization. At point (1) the velocities are aligned towards the minima, with the  $\beta = 0.999$  velocity contributing substantially more to each update. By point (2) the system has begun to oscillate. While the  $\beta = 0.999$  velocity is still pointed away from the minima, the  $\beta = 0.9$  velocity has changed direction and is damping the system. Combining the velocities allows AggMo to achieve fast convergence while reducing the impact of oscillations caused by large  $\beta$  values.

# 3.1 Using AggMo

Choosing the damping vector Recall that in a direction with small but steady gradient, the terminal velocity is proportional to  $1 / (1 - \beta)$ . We found that a good choice of damping vectors was therefore to space the terminal velocities exponentially. To do so, we specify an exponential scale-factor,  $a$ , and a count  $K$ . The damping vector is then constructed as  $\beta^{(i)} = 1 - a^{i - 1}$ , for  $i = 1\ldots K$ . We fix  $a = 0.1$  throughout and vary only  $K$ . A good default choice is  $K = 3$  which corresponds to  $\beta = [0,0.9,0.99]$ . We found this setting to be both stable and effective in all of our experiments.

Computational/Memory overhead There is very little additional computational overhead when using AggMo compared to CM, as it only requires a handful of extra addition and multiplication operations on top of the single gradient evaluation. There is some memory overhead due to storing the  $K$  velocity vectors, which are each the same size as the parameter vector. However, for most modern deep learning applications, the memory cost at training time is dominated by the activations rather

than the parameters (Gomez et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2016; Werbos, 1990; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), so the overhead will generally be small.

# 4 Recovering Nesterov momentum

In this section we show that we can recover Nesterov Momentum (Equation 2) using a simple generalization of Aggregated Momentum (Equation 3). We now introduce separate learning rates for each velocity,  $\gamma^{(i)}$ , so that the iterate update step from Equation 3 is replaced with,

$$
\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t} = \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {K} \gamma_ {t} ^ {(i)} \mathbf {v} _ {t} ^ {(i)} \tag {4}
$$

with each velocity updated as in Equation 3. To recover Nesterov momentum we consider the special case of  $\beta = [0,\beta ]$  and  $\gamma_t^{(1)} = 2\gamma ,\gamma_t^{(2)} = 2\beta \gamma$  . The AggMo update rule can now be written as,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbf {v} _ {t} = \beta \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1} - \nabla_ {\theta} f (\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1}) \\ \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t} = \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \frac {\gamma^ {(2)}}{2} \mathbf {v} _ {t} - \frac {\gamma^ {(1)}}{2} \nabla_ {\theta} f (\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1}) \tag {5} \\ = \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \gamma \beta^ {2} \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1} - (1 + \beta) \gamma \nabla_ {\theta} f (\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Similarly, we may write the Nesterov momentum update with constant learning rate  $\gamma_{t} = \gamma$  as,

$$
\mathbf {v} _ {t} = \beta \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1} - \nabla_ {\theta} f (\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \gamma \beta \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1})
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t} = \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \gamma \beta \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1} - \gamma \nabla_ {\theta} f (\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {t - 1} + \gamma \beta \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1}) \tag {6}
$$

Now we consider Equation 6 when using the reparameterization given by  $\phi_t = \theta_t + \gamma \beta \mathbf{v}_t$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \boldsymbol {\phi} _ {t} - \gamma \beta \mathbf {v} _ {t} = \boldsymbol {\phi} _ {t - 1} - \gamma \nabla_ {\theta} f (\boldsymbol {\phi} _ {t - 1}) \\ \Rightarrow \phi_ {t} = \phi_ {t - 1} + \gamma \beta \mathbf {v} _ {t} - \gamma \nabla_ {\theta} f \left(\phi_ {t - 1}\right) \tag {7} \\ \mathbf {\phi} = \phi_ {t - 1} + \gamma \beta^ {2} \mathbf {v} _ {t - 1} - (1 + \beta) \gamma \nabla_ {\theta} f (\phi_ {t - 1}) \\ \end{array}
$$

It follows that the update to  $\phi$  from Nesterov is identical to the AggMo update to  $\theta$ , and we have  $\phi_0 = \theta_0$ . We can think of the  $\phi$  reparameterization as taking a half-step forward in the Nesterov optimization allowing us to directly compare the iterates at each time step. We note also that if  $\gamma_t^{(1)} = \gamma_t^{(2)} = 2\gamma$  then the equivalence holds approximately when  $\beta$  is sufficiently close to 1. We demonstrate this equivalence empirically in Appendix B.

# 5 Analyzing Quadratic Convergence

We can learn a great deal about optimizers by carefully reasoning about their convergence on quadratic functions. O'Donoghue & Candes (2015) point out that in practice we do not know the condition number of the function to be optimized and so we aim to design algorithms which work well over a large possible range. Sharing this motivation, we consider the convergence behaviour of momentum optimizers on quadratic functions with fixed hyperparameters over a range of condition numbers.

To compute the convergence rate,  $||\pmb{\theta}_t - \pmb{\theta}^*||^2$ , we model each optimizer as a linear dynamical systems as in Lessard et al. (2016). The convergence rate is then determined by the eigenvalues of this system. We leave details of this computation to appendix B.

Figure 3 displays the convergence rate of each optimizer for quadratics with condition numbers  $(\kappa)$  from  $10^{1}$  to  $10^{7}$ . The blue dashed line displays the optimal convergence rate achievable by CM with knowledge of the condition number — an unrealistic scenario in practice. The two curves corresponding to CM (red and purple) each meet the optimal convergence rate when the condition number is such that  $\beta$  is critical. On the left of this critical point, where the convergence rates for CM are flat, the system is "under-damped" meaning there are complex eigenvalues corresponding to oscillations.

We observe that the convergence rate of AggMo interpolates smoothly between the convergence rates of CM with  $\beta = 0.9$  and  $\beta = 0.99$  as the condition number varies. AggMo's ability to quickly kill oscillations leads to an approximately three-times faster convergence rate than Nesterov momentum in the under-damped regime without sacrificing performance on larger condition numbers.

Figure 3: Convergence on quadratics of varying condition number. AggMo interpolates between the convergence rates of CM at  $\beta = 0.9$  and  $\beta = 0.99$ .

Additional convergence analysis In appendix C we present a formal statement and proof of the convergence rate of AggMo in the setting of online convex programming, which captures stochastic convex programming as a special case. We also address some open questions on the convergence of AggMo and highlight some surprising properties that make theoretical analysis of AggMo challenging.

# 6 Related work

The convergence of momentum methods has been studied extensively, both theoretically and empirically (Wibisono & Wilson, 2015; Wibisono et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2016; Kidambi et al., 2018). By analyzing the failure modes of existing methods these works motivate successful momentum schemes. Sutskever et al. (2013) explored the effect of momentum on the optimization of neural networks and introduced the momentum view of Nesterov's accelerated gradient. They focused on producing good momentum schedules during optimization to adapt to ill-conditioned curvature. Despite strong evidence that this approach works well, practitioners today still typically opt for a fixed momentum schedule and vary the learning rate instead.

Adaptive gradient methods have been introduced to deal with the ill-conditioned curvature that we often observe in deep learning (Duchi et al., 2011; Kingma & Ba, 2014; Zeiler, 2012; Tieleman & Hinton, 2012). These methods typically approximate the local curvature of the objective to adapt to the geometry of the data. Wilson et al. (2017) highlight the inability of adaptive methods to generalize as well as classical momentum on deep learning tasks. Natural gradient descent (Amari, 1998) preconditions by the Fisher information matrix, which can be shown to approximate the Hessian under certain assumptions (Martens, 2014). Several methods have been proposed to reduce the computational and memory cost of this approach (Martens & Grosse, 2015; Martens, 2010) but these are difficult to implement and introduce additional hyperparameters and computational overhead compared to SGD.

Another line of adaptive methods seeks to detect when oscillations occur during optimization. O'Donoghue & Candes (2015) proposed using an adaptive restarting scheme to remove oscillations whenever they are detected. In its simplest form, this is achieved by setting the momentum velocity to zero whenever the loss increases. Further work has suggested using an adaptive momentum schedule instead of zeroing (Srinivasan et al., 2018). Although this technique works well for well-conditioned convex problems it is difficult to find an appropriate restart condition for stochastic optimization where we do not have an accurate computation of the loss. On the other hand, AggMo's passive damping approach addresses the oscillation problem without the need to detect its occurrence.

# 7 Evaluation

We evaluated the AggMo optimizer on the following deep learning architectures; deep autoencoders, convolutional networks, and LSTMs. To do so we used four datasets: MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) and Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). In each experiment we compared AggMo to classical momentum, Nesterov momentum, and

Adam. These optimizers are by far the most commonly used and even today remain very difficult to outperform in a wide range of tasks. For each method, we performed a grid search over the learning rate and the damping coefficient. For AggMo, we keep the scale  $a = 0.1$  fixed and vary  $K$  as discussed in Section 3.1. Full details of the experimental set up for each task can be found in Appendix D.

For each of the following experiments we choose to report the validation and test performance of the network in addition to the final training loss when it is meaningful to do so. We include these generalization results because recent work has shown that the choice of optimizer may have a significant effect on the generalization error of the network in practice (Wilson et al., 2017).

# 7.1 Autoencoders

We trained fully-connected autoencoders on the MNIST dataset using a set-up similar to that of Sutskever et al. (2013). While their work focused on finding an optimal momentum schedule we instead kept the momentum fixed and applied a simple learning rate decay schedule. For CM and Nesterov we evaluated damping coefficients in the range:  $\{0.0, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999\}$ . For Adam, it is standard to use  $\beta_{1} = 0.9$  and  $\beta_{2} = 0.999$ . Since  $\beta_{1}$  is analogous to the momentum damping parameter, we considered  $\beta_{1} \in \{0.9, 0.99, 0.999\}$  and kept  $\beta_{2} = 0.999$ . For AggMo, we explored  $K$  in  $\{2,3,4\}$ . Each model was trained for 1000 epochs.

We report the training, validation, and test errors in Table 1. Results are displayed for the hyperparameters that achieved the best training loss and also for those that achieved the best validation loss. While Adam is able to perform well on the training objective it is unable to match the performance of AggMo or Nesterov on the validation/test sets. AggMo achieves the best performance in all cases.

In these experiments the optimal damping coefficient for both CM and Nesterov was  $\beta = 0.99$  while the optimal damping vector for AggMo was  $\beta = [0.0, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999]$ , given by  $K = 4$ . In Figure 4 we compare the convergence of each of the optimizers under the optimal hyperparameters for the training loss.

Increasing damping coefficients During our experiments we observed that AggMo remains stable during optimization for learning rates an order of magnitude (or more) larger than is possible for CM and Nesterov with  $\beta$  equal to the max damping coefficient used in AggMo.

We further investigated the effect of increasing the maximum damping coefficient of AggMo in Figure 5. The learning rate is fixed at 0.1 and we vary  $K$  from 2 to 5. We compared to Nesterov with damping coefficients in the same range (max of 0.9999) and a fixed learning rate of 0.05 (to be

consistent with our analysis in Section 4). We do not include the curves for which training is unstable: Nesterov with  $\beta \in \{0.999, 0.9999\}$  and AggMo with  $K = 5$ . AggMo is able to take advantage of the larger damping coefficient of 0.999 and achieves the fastest overall convergence.

# 7.2 Classification

For the following experiments we evaluated AggMo using two network architectures: a neural network with 5 convolutional layers (CNN-5) and the ResNet-34 architecture (He et al., 2016). We use data augmentation and regularization only for the latter. Each model was trained for 500 epochs.

For each optimizer we report the accuracy on a randomly held out validation set and the test set. All of the models achieve near-perfect accuracy on the training set and so we do not report this. The results are displayed in Table 2. For both of the CIFAR-10 experiments we observed the best validation accuracy using the AggMo optimizer. However, for both of the ResNet models trained we found that Nesterov momentum achieved a better test set accuracy even with equal or worse validation.

We found that our proposed default hyperparameters for AggMo ( $a = 0.1$ ,  $K = 3$ ) consistently outperformed CM and Nesterov with  $\beta = 0.9$ , a common default choice. We present the full results across all experiments in Appendix E. Figure 6 shows the training loss and validation accuracy during training for each optimizer used to train the ResNet-34 model. The hyperparameters used for each plot are those which obtained the best validation accuracy. We observe early validation flat-lining of Adam as described in Wilson et al. (2017). AggMo converged more quickly than Nesterov on the training objective without sacrificing validation performance.

We note that the additional network hyperparameters (e.g. weight decay) are defaults which were likely picked as they work well with classical momentum. This may disadvantage the other optimizers, including our own. Despite this, we found that we are able to outperform CM with the AggMo and Nesterov optimizers without additional tuning of any of these hyperparameters.

We trained LSTM Language Models on the Penn Treebank dataset. We followed the experimental setup of Merity et al. (2017) and made use of the code provided by the authors. We used the optimal hyperparameter settings described by the authors and vary only the learning rate, momentum and whether gradient clipping is used. The network hyperparameters were tuned using SGD and may not be optimal for the other optimizers we evaluate (including our own). We followed only the base

Table 3: Penn Treebank LSTM Perplexity across different optimizers. We display the train, validation, and test error for the optimization run that produced the best validation loss. * uses ASGD (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) and corresponds to the base model reported in Merity et al. (2017)

model training used in Merity et al. (2017) and do not include the fine-tuning and continuous cache optimization steps. Each model was trained for 750 epochs.

As noted in Merity et al. (2017), it is typically observed that SGD without momentum performs better than momentum-based methods in language modeling tasks. However, in our experiments we observed all momentum-based optimizers but CM outperform SGD without momentum. Surprisingly, we found that Adam is well-suited to this task and achieves the best training, validation, and test performance. We believe that the heavy regularization used when training the network makes Adam a good choice. AggMo is very close in terms of final performance to Adam.

Table 3 contains the results for the hyperparameter settings which achieved the best validation error for each optimizer. The first row (denoted *) uses the scheme suggested in Merity et al. (2017): once the validation loss plateaus we switch to the ASGD (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) optimizer. The other rows instead decay the learning rate when the validation loss plateaus.

Figure 7 compares the convergence of the training and validation perplexity of each optimizer. While the momentum methods converge after 300 epochs, the momentum-free methods converged much more slowly. Surprisingly, we found that SGD worked best without any learning rate decay. Adam converged most quickly and achieved a validation perplexity which is comparable to that of AggMo. While gradient clipping is critical for SGD without momentum, which utilizes a large learning rate, we found that all of the momentum methods perform better without gradient clipping.

In short, while existing work encourages practitioners to avoid classical momentum we found that using other momentum methods may significantly improve convergence rates and final performance. AggMo worked especially well on this task over a large range of damping coefficients and learning rates.

# 8 Conclusion

Aggregated Momentum is a simple extension to classical momentum which is easy to implement and has negligible computational overhead on modern deep learning tasks. We showed empirically that AggMo is able to remain stable even with large damping coefficients and enjoys faster convergence rates as a consequence of this. Nesterov momentum can be viewed as a special case of AggMo. (Incidentally, we found that despite its lack of adoption by deep learning practitioners, Nesterov momentum also showed substantial advantages compared to classical momentum.) On the tasks we explored, AggMo could be used as a drop-in replacement for existing optimizers with little-to-no additional hyperparameter tuning.
