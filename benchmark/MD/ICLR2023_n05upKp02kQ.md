# ABSTRACT

Partial Observability—where agents can only observe partial information about the true underlying state of the system—is ubiquitous in real-world applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Theoretically, learning a near-optimal policy under partial observability is known to be hard in the worst case due to an exponential sample complexity lower bound. Recent work has identified several tractable subclasses that are learnable with polynomial samples, such as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with certain revealing or decodability conditions. However, this line of research is still in its infancy, where (1) unified structural conditions enabling sample-efficient learning are lacking; (2) existing sample complexities for known tractable subclasses are far from sharp; and (3) fewer sample-efficient algorithms are available than in fully observable RL.

This paper advances all three aspects above for Partially Observable RL in the general setting of Predictive State Representations (PSRs). First, we propose a natural and unified structural condition for PSRs called  $B$ -stability. B-stable PSRs encompasses the vast majority of known tractable subclasses such as weakly revealing POMDPs, low-rank future-sufficient POMDPs, decodable POMDPs, and regular PSRs. Next, we show that any B-stable PSR can be learned with polynomial samples in relevant problem parameters. When instantiated in the aforementioned subclasses, our sample complexities improve substantially over the current best ones. Finally, our results are achieved by three algorithms simultaneously: Optimistic Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Estimation-to-Decisions, and Model-Based Optimistic Posterior Sampling. The latter two algorithms are new for sample-efficient learning of POMDPs/PSRs.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning (RL)—where agents can only observe partial information about the true underlying state of the system—is ubiquitous in real-world applications of RL such as robotics (Akkaya et al., 2019), strategic games (Brown & Sandholm, 2018; Vinyals et al., 2019; Berner et al., 2019), economic simulation (Zheng et al., 2020), and so on. Partially observable RL defies standard efficient approaches for learning and planning in the fully observable case (e.g. those based on dynamical programming) due to the non-Markovian nature of the observations (Jaakkola et al., 1994), and has been a hard challenge for RL research.

Theoretically, it is well-established that learning in partial observable RL is statistically hard in the worst case—In the standard setting of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), learning a near-optimal policy has an exponential sample complexity lower bound in the horizon length (Mossal & Roch, 2005; Krishnamurthy et al., 2016), which in stark contrast to fully observable MDPs where polynomial sample complexity is possible (Kearns & Singh, 2002; Jaksch et al., 2010; Azar et al., 2017). A later line of work identifies various additional structural conditions or alternative learning goals that enable sample-efficient learning, such as reactivity (Jiang et al., 2017), revealing conditions (Jin et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2022b; Cai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022), decodability (Du et al., 2019; Efroni et al., 2022), and learning memoryless or short-memory policies (Azizzadenesheli et al., 2018; Uehara et al., 2022b).

Despite these progresses, research on sample-efficient partially observable RL is still at an early stage, with several important questions remaining open. First, to a large extent, existing tractable structural conditions are mostly identified and analyzed in a case-by-case manner and lack a more unified understanding. This question has just started to be tackled in the very recent work of Zhan et al. (2022), who show that sample-efficient learning is possible in the more general setting of Predictive State Representations (PSRs) (Littman & Sutton, 2001)—which include POMDPs as a special case—with a certain regularity condition. However, their regularity condition is defined in terms of additional quantities (such as "core matrices") not directly encoded in the definition of PSRs, which makes it unnatural in many known examples and unable to subsume important tractable problems such as decodable POMDPs.

Second, even in known sample-efficient problems such as revealing POMDPs (Jin et al., 2020c; Liu et al., 2022a), existing sample complexities involve large polynomial factors of relevant problem parameters that are likely far from sharp. Third, relatively few principles are known for designing sample-efficient algorithms in POMDPs/PSRs, such as spectral or tensor-based approaches (Hsu et al., 2012; Azizzadenesheli et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2020c), maximum likelihood or density estimation (Liu et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2022; Zhan et al., 2022), or learning short-memory policies (Efroni et al., 2022; Uehara et al., 2022b). This contrasts with fully observable RL where the space of sample-efficient algorithms is much more diverse (Agarwal et al., 2019). It is an important question whether we can expand the space of algorithms for partially observable RL.

This paper advances all three aspects above for partially observable RL. We define  $B$ -stability, a natural and general structural condition for PSRs, and design sharp algorithms for learning any B-stable PSR sample-efficiently. Our contributions can be summarized as follows.

- We identify a new structural condition for PSRs termed  $B$ -stability, which simply requires its  $B$ -representation (or observable operators) be bounded in a suitable operator norm (Section 3.1). B-stable PSRs subsume most known tractable subclasses such as revealing POMDPs, decodable POMDPs, low-rank future-sufficient POMDPs, and regular PSRs (Section 3.2).  
- We show that B-stable PSRs can be learned sample-efficiently by three algorithms simultaneously with sharp sample complexities (Section 4): Optimistic Maximum Likelihood Estimation (OMLE), Explorative Estimation-to-Decisions (EXPLORATIVE E2D), and Model-based Optimistic Posterior Sampling (MOPS). To our best knowledge, the latter two algorithms are first shown to be sample-efficient in partially observable RL.  
- Our sample complexities improve substantially over the current best when instantiated in both regular PSRs (Section 4.1) and known tractable subclasses of POMDPs (Section 5). For example, for  $m$ -step  $\alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}$ -revealing POMDPs with  $S$  latent states, our algorithms find an  $\varepsilon$  near-optimal policy within  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(S^2 A^m \log \mathcal{N} / (\alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}^2 \varepsilon^2)\right)$  episodes of play (with  $S^2 / \alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}^2$  replaced by  $S \Lambda_{\mathtt{B}}^{2}$  if measured in B-stability), which improves significantly over the current best result of  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(S^4 A^{6m - 4} \log \mathcal{N} / (\alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}^4 \varepsilon^2)\right)$ . A summary of such comparisons is presented in Table 1.  
- Technically, our three algorithms rely on a unified sharp analysis of B-stable PSRs that involves a careful error decomposition in terms of its B-representation, along with a new generalized  $\ell_2$ -type Eluder argument, which may be of future interest (Appendix B).

Related work Our work is closely related to the long lines of work on sample-efficient learning of fully/partially observable RL (with/without function approximation), especially the lines of work on POMDPs and PSRs. We review these related works in Appendix A due to the space limit.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

Sequential decision processes with observations An episodic sequential decision process is specified by a tuple  $\{H, \mathcal{O}, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P}, \{r_h\}_{h=1}^H\}$ , where  $H \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 1}$  is the horizon length;  $\mathcal{O}$  is the observation space with  $|\mathcal{O}| = \mathcal{O}$ ;  $\mathcal{A}$  is the action space with  $|\mathcal{A}| = A$ ;  $\mathbb{P}$  specifies the transition dynamics, such that the initial observation follows  $o_1 \sim \mathbb{P}_0(\cdot) \in \Delta(\mathcal{O})$ , and given the history  $\tau_h := (o_1, a_1, \dots, o_h, a_h)$  up to step  $h$ , the observation follows  $o_{h+1} \sim \mathbb{P}(\cdot | \tau_h)$ ;  $r_h: \mathcal{O} \times \mathcal{A} \to [0,1]$  is the reward function at  $h$ -th step, which we assume is a known deterministic function of  $(o_h, a_h)$ .

A policy  $\pi = \{\pi_h:(\mathcal{O}\times \mathcal{A})^{h - 1}\times \mathcal{O}\to \Delta (\mathcal{A})\}_{h = 1}^H$  is a collection of  $H$  functions. At step  $h\in [H]$ , an agent running policy  $\pi$  observes the observation  $o_{h}$  and takes action  $a_{h}\sim \pi_{h}(\cdot |\tau_{h - 1},o_{h})\in \Delta (\mathcal{A})$  based on the history  $(\tau_{h - 1},o_h) = (o_1,a_1,\dots ,o_{h - 1},a_{h - 1},o_h)$ . The agent then receives their reward  $r_h(o_h,a_h)$ , and the environment generates the next observation  $o_{h + 1}\sim \mathbb{P}(\cdot |\tau_h)$  based on  $\tau_{h} = (o_{1},a_{1},\dots ,o_{h},a_{h})$ . The episode terminates immediately after the dummy observation  $o_{H + 1} = o_{\mathrm{dum}}$  is generated. We use  $\Pi$  to denote the set of all deterministic policies, and identify  $\Delta (\Pi)$  as both the set of all policies and all distributions over deterministic policies interchangeably. For any  $(h,\tau_h)$ , let  $\mathbb{P}(\tau_h)\coloneqq \prod_{h'\leqslant h}\mathbb{P}(o_{h'}|\tau_{h' - 1})$ ,  $\pi (\tau_h)\coloneqq \prod_{h'\leqslant h}\pi_{h'}(a_{h'}|\tau_{h' - 1},o_{h'})$ , and let  $\mathbb{P}^{\pi}(\tau_h)\coloneqq \mathbb{P}(\tau_h)\times \pi (\tau_h)$  denote the probability of observing  $\tau_h$  (for the first  $h$  steps) when executing  $\pi$ . The value of a policy  $\pi$  is defined as the expected cumulative reward  $V(\pi)\coloneqq \mathbb{E}^{\pi}[\sum_{h = 1}^{H}r_h(o_h,a_h)]$ . We assume that  $\sum_{h = 1}^{H}r_{h}(o_{h},a_{h})\leqslant 1$  almost surely for any policy  $\pi$ .

POMDPs A Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is a special sequential decision process whose transition dynamics are governed by latent states. An episodic POMDP is specified by a tuple  $\{H, S, \mathcal{O}, \mathcal{A}, \{\mathbb{T}_h\}_{h=1}^H, \{\mathbb{O}_h\}_{h=1}^H, \{r_h\}_{h=1}^H, \mu_1\}$ , where  $\mathcal{S}$  is the latent state space with  $|S| = S$ ,  $\mathbb{O}_h(\cdot|\cdot): \mathcal{S} \to \Delta(\mathcal{O})$  is the emission dynamics at step  $h$  (which we identify as an emission matrix  $\mathbb{O}_h \in \mathbb{R}^{O \times S}$ ),  $\mathbb{T}_h(\cdot|\cdot,\cdot): \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{S}$  is the transition dynamics over the latent states (which we identify as transition matrices  $\mathbb{T}_h(\cdot|\cdot,a) \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times S}$  for each  $a \in \mathcal{A}$ ), and  $\mu_1 \in \Delta(S)$  specifies the distribution of initial state. At each step  $h$ , given latent state  $s_h$  (which the agent cannot observe), the system emits observation  $o_h \sim \mathbb{O}_h(\cdot|s_h)$ , receives action  $a_h \in \mathcal{A}$  from the agent, emits the reward  $r_h(o_h, a_h)$ , and then transits to the next latent state  $s_{h+1} \sim \mathbb{T}_h(\cdot|s_h, a_h)$  in a Markov fashion. Note that (with known rewards) a POMDP can be fully described by the parameter  $\theta := (\mathbb{T}, \mathbb{O}, \mu_1)$ .

# 2.1 PREDICTIVE STATE REPRESENTATIONS

We consider Predictive State Representations (PSRs) (Littman & Sutton, 2001), a broader class of sequential decision processes that generalize POMDPs by removing the explicit assumption of latent states, but still requiring the system dynamics to be described succinctly by a core test set.

PSR, core test sets, and predictive states A test  $t$  is a sequence of future observations and actions (i.e.  $t \in \mathfrak{T} := \bigcup_{W \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 1}} \mathcal{O}^W \times \mathcal{A}^{W-1}$ ). For some test  $t_h = (o_{h:h+W-1}, a_{h:h+W-2})$  with length  $W \geqslant 1$ , we define the probability of test  $t_h$  being successful conditioned on (reachable) history  $\tau_{h-1}$  as  $\mathbb{P}(t_h | \tau_{h-1}) := \mathbb{P}(o_{h:h+W-1} | \tau_{h-1}; \mathrm{do}(a_{h:h+W-2}))$ , i.e., the probability of observing  $o_{h:h+W-1}$  if the agent deterministically executes actions  $a_{h:h+W-2}$ , conditioned on history  $\tau_{h-1}$ . We follow the convention that, if  $\mathbb{P}^\pi(\tau_{h-1}) = 0$  for any  $\pi$ , then  $\mathbb{P}(t | \tau_{h-1}) = 0$ .

Definition 1 (PSR, core test sets, and predictive states). For any  $h \in [H]$ , we say a set  $\mathcal{U}_h \subset \mathfrak{T}$  is a core test set at step  $h$  if the following holds: For any  $W \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 1}$ , any possible future (i.e., test)  $t_h = (o_{h:h + W - 1}, a_{h:h + W - 2}) \in \mathcal{O}^W \times \mathcal{A}^{W - 1}$ , there exists a vector  $b_{t_h,h} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_h}$  such that

$$
\mathbb {P} \left(t _ {h} \mid \tau_ {h - 1}\right) = \left\langle b _ {t _ {h}, h}, \left[ \mathbb {P} \left(t \mid \tau_ {h - 1}\right) \right] _ {t \in \mathcal {U} _ {h}} \right\rangle , \quad \forall \tau_ {h - 1} \in \mathcal {T} ^ {h - 1} := (\mathcal {O} \times \mathcal {A}) ^ {h - 1}. \tag {1}
$$

We refer to the vector  $\mathbf{q}(\tau_{h-1}) \coloneqq [\mathbb{P}(t|\tau_{h-1})]_{t \in \mathcal{U}_h}$  as the predictive state at step  $h$  (with convention  $\mathbf{q}(\tau_{h-1}) = 0$  if  $\tau_{h-1}$  is not reachable), and  $\mathbf{q}_0 \coloneqq [\mathbb{P}(t)]_{t \in \mathcal{U}_1}$  as the initial predictive state. A (linear) PSR is a sequential decision process equipped with a core test set  $\{\mathcal{U}_h\}_{h \in [H]}$ .

The predictive state  $\mathbf{q}(\tau_{h - 1})\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_h}$  in a PSR acts like a "latent state" that governs the transition  $\mathbb{P}(\cdot |\tau_{h - 1})$  through the linear structure (1). We define  $\mathcal{U}_{A,h}\coloneqq \{\mathbf{a}:(\mathbf{o},\mathbf{a})\in \mathcal{U}_h$  for some  $\mathbf{o}\in \bigcup_{W\in \mathbb{N}^{+}}\mathcal{O}^{W}\}$  as the set of action sequences (possibly including an empty sequence) in  $\mathcal{U}_h$ , with  $U_{A}\coloneqq \max_{h\in [H]}|\mathcal{U}_{A,h}|$ . Further define  $\mathcal{U}_{H + 1}\coloneqq \{o_{\mathrm{dum}}\}$  for notational simplicity. Throughout the paper, we assume the core test sets  $(\mathcal{U}_h)_{h\in [H]}$  are known and the same within the PSR model class.

B-representation We define the  $B$ -representation of a PSR, a standard notion for PSRs (also known as the observable operators (Jaeger, 2000)).

Definition 2 (B-representation). A  $B$ -representation of a PSR with core test set  $(\mathcal{U}_h)_{h\in [H]}$  is a set of matrices  ${}^2\left\{(\mathbf{B}_h(o_h,a_h)\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_{h + 1}\times \mathcal{U}_h})_{h,o_h,a_h},\mathbf{q}_0\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_1}\right\}$  such that for any  $0\leqslant h\leqslant H$ , policy  $\pi$ , history  $\tau_{h} = (o_{1:h},a_{1:h})\in \mathcal{T}^{h}$ , and core test  $t_{h + 1} = (o_{h + 1:h + W},a_{h + 1:h + W - 1})\in \mathcal{U}_{h + 1}$ , the quantity  $\mathbb{P}(\tau_h,t_{h + 1})$ , i.e. the probability of observing  $o_{1:h + W}$  upon taking actions  $a_{1:h + W - 1}$ , admits the decomposition

$$
\mathbb {P} \left(\tau_ {h}, t _ {h + 1}\right) = \mathbb {P} \left(o _ {1: h + W} \mid \mathrm {d o} \left(a _ {1: h + W - 1}\right)\right) = \mathbf {e} _ {t _ {h + 1}} ^ {\top} \cdot \mathbf {B} _ {h: 1} \left(\tau_ {h}\right) \cdot \mathbf {q} _ {0}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $\mathbf{e}_{t_{h + 1}}\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_{h + 1}}$  is the indicator vector of  $t_{h + 1}\in \mathcal{U}_{h + 1}$ , and

$$
\mathbf {B} _ {h: 1} \left(\tau_ {h}\right) := \mathbf {B} _ {h} \left(o _ {h}, a _ {h}\right) \mathbf {B} _ {h - 1} \left(o _ {h - 1}, a _ {h - 1}\right) \dots \mathbf {B} _ {1} \left(o _ {1}, a _ {1}\right).
$$

It is a standard result (see e.g. Thon & Jaeger (2015)) that any PSR admits a B-representation, and the converse also holds—any sequential decision process admitting a B-representation on test sets  $(\mathcal{U}_h)_{h\in [H]}$  is a PSR with core test set  $(\mathcal{U}_h)_{h\in [H]}$  (Proposition D.1). However, the B-representation of a given PSR may not be unique. We also remark that the B-representation is used in the structural conditions and theoretical analyses only, and will not be explicitly used in our algorithms.

Rank An important complexity measure of a PSR is its PSR rank (henceforth also "rank").

Definition 3 (PSR rank). Given a PSR, its PSR rank is defined as  $d_{\mathrm{PSR}} \coloneqq \max_{h \in [H]} \operatorname{rank}(D_h)$ , where  $D_h \coloneqq [\mathbf{q}(\tau_h)]_{\tau_h \in \mathcal{T}^h} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_{h+1} \times \mathcal{T}^h}$  is the matrix formed by predictive states at step  $h \in [H]$ .

The PSR rank measures the inherent dimension<sup>3</sup> of the space of predictive state vectors, which always admits the upper bound  $d_{\mathrm{PSR}} \leqslant \max_{h \in [H]} |\mathcal{U}_h|$ , but may in addition be much smaller.

POMDPs as low-rank PSRs As a primary example, all POMDPs are PSRs with rank at most  $S$  (Zhan et al., 2022, Lemma 2). First, Definition 1 can be satisfied trivially by choosing  $\mathcal{U}_h = \bigcup_{1\leqslant W\leqslant H - h + 1}\{(o_h,a_h,\dots ,o_{h + W - 1})\}$  as the set of all possible tests, and  $b_{t_h,h} = \mathbf{e}_{t_h}\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_h}$  as indicator vectors. For concrete subclasses of POMDPs, we will consider alternative choices of  $(\mathcal{U}_h)_{h\in [H]}$  with much smaller cardinalities than this default choice. Second, to compute the rank (Definition 3), note that by the latent state structure of POMDPs, we have  $\mathbb{P}(t_{h + 1}|\tau_h) = \sum_{s_{h + 1}}\mathbb{P}(t_{h + 1}|s_{h + 1})\mathbb{P}(s_{h + 1}|\tau_h)$  for any  $(h,\tau_h,t_{h + 1})$ . Therefore, the associated matrix  $D_{h} = [\mathbb{P}(t_{h + 1}|\tau_{h})]_{(t_{h + 1},\tau_{h})\in \mathcal{U}_{h + 1}\times \mathcal{T}^{h}}$  always has the following decomposition:

$$
D _ {h} = \left[ \mathbb {P} \left(t _ {h + 1} \mid s _ {h + 1}\right) \right] _ {\left(t _ {h + 1}, s _ {h + 1}\right) \in \mathcal {U} _ {h + 1} \times \mathcal {S}} \times \left[ \mathbb {P} \left(s _ {h + 1} \mid \tau_ {h}\right) \right] _ {\left(s _ {h + 1}, \tau_ {h}\right) \in \mathcal {S} \times \mathcal {T} ^ {h}},
$$

which implies that  $d_{\mathrm{PSR}} = \max_{h \in [H]} \operatorname{rank}(D_h) \leqslant S$ .

Learning goal We consider the standard PAC learning setting, where we are given a model class of PSRs  $\Theta$  and interact with a ground truth model  $\theta^{\star} \in \Theta$ . Note that, as we do not put further restrictions on the parametrization, this setting allows any general function approximation for the model class. For any model class  $\Theta$ , we define its (optimistic) covering number  $\mathcal{N}_{\Theta}(\rho)$  for  $\rho > 0$  in Definition C.4. Let  $V_{\theta}(\pi)$  denote the value function of policy  $\pi$  under model  $\theta$ , and  $\pi_{\theta} := \arg \max_{\pi \in \Pi} V_{\theta}(\pi)$  denote the optimal policy of model  $\theta$ . The goal is to learn a policy  $\hat{\pi}$  that achieves small suboptimality  $V_{\star} - V_{\theta^{\star}}(\hat{\pi})$  within as few episodes of play as possible, where  $V_{\star} := V_{\theta^{\star}}(\pi_{\theta^{\star}})$ . We refer to an algorithm as sample-efficient if it finds an  $\varepsilon$ -near optimal policy within poly(relevant problem parameters,  $1 / \varepsilon$ )<sup>4</sup> episodes of play.

# 3 PSRS WITH B-STABILITY

We begin by proposing a natural and general structural condition for PSR called  $B$ -stability (or also stability). We show that B-stable PSRs encompass and generalize a variety of existing tractable POMDPs and PSRs, and can be learned sample-efficiently as we show in the sequel.

# 3.1 THE B-STABILITY CONDITION

For any PSR with an associated B-representation, we define its  $\mathcal{B}$ -operators  $\{\mathcal{B}_{H:h}\}_{h\in [H]}$  as

$$
\mathcal {B} _ {H: h}: \mathbb {R} ^ {\mathcal {U} _ {h}} \to (\mathcal {O} \times \mathcal {A}) ^ {H - h + 1}, \qquad \mathbf {q} \mapsto \left[ \mathbf {B} _ {H: h} \big (\tau_ {h: H} \big) \cdot \mathbf {q} \right] _ {\tau_ {h: H} \in (\mathcal {O} \times \mathcal {A}) ^ {H - h + 1}}.
$$

For each  $h \in [H]$ , we equip the image space of  $\mathcal{B}_{H:h}$  with the  $\Pi$ -norm: For a vector  $\mathbf{b}$  indexed by  $\tau_{h:H} \in (\mathcal{O} \times \mathcal{A})^{H - h + 1}$ , we define

$$
\left\| \mathbf {b} \right\| _ {\Pi} := \max  _ {\bar {\pi}} \sum_ {\tau_ {h: H} \in (\mathcal {O} \times \mathcal {A}) ^ {H - h + 1}} \bar {\pi} \left(\tau_ {h: H}\right) \mathbf {b} \left(\tau_ {h: H}\right), \tag {3}
$$

where the maximization is over all policies  $\bar{\pi}$  starting from step  $h$  (ignoring the history  $\tau_{h-1}$ ) and  $\bar{\pi}(\tau_{h:H}) = \prod_{h \leqslant h' \leqslant H} \bar{\pi}_{h'}(a_{h'}|o_{h'}, \tau_{h:h'-1})$ . We further equip the domain  $\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_h}$  with a fused-norm  $\|\cdot\|_*$ , which is defined as the maximum of  $(1,2)$ -norm and  $\Pi'$ -norm:

$$
\left\| \mathbf {q} \right\| _ {*} := \max  \left\{\left\| \mathbf {q} \right\| _ {1, 2}, \left\| \mathbf {q} \right\| _ {\Pi^ {\prime}} \right\}, \tag {4}
$$

$$
\left\| \mathbf {q} \right\| _ {1, 2} := \left(\sum_ {\mathbf {a} \in \mathcal {U} _ {A, h}} \left(\sum_ {\mathbf {o}: (\mathbf {o}, \mathbf {a}) \in \mathcal {U} _ {h}} | \mathbf {q} (\mathbf {o}, \mathbf {a}) |\right) ^ {2}\right) ^ {1 / 2}, \quad \left\| \mathbf {q} \right\| _ {\Pi^ {\prime}} := \max  _ {\bar {\pi}} \sum_ {t \in \bar {\mathcal {U}} _ {h}} \bar {\pi} (t) | \mathbf {q} (t) |, \tag {5}
$$

where  $\overline{\mathcal{U}}_h\coloneqq \{t\in \mathcal{U}_h:\not\exists t'\in \mathcal{U}_h$  such that  $t$  is a prefix of  $t^{\prime}\}$

We now define the B-stability condition, which simply requires the  $\mathcal{B}$ -operators  $\{\mathcal{B}_{H:h}\}_{h\in [H]}$  to have bounded operator norms from the fused-norm to the  $\Pi$ -norm.

Definition 4 (B-stability). A PSR is B-stable with parameter  $\Lambda_{\mathsf{B}} \geqslant 1$  (henceforth also  $\Lambda_{\mathsf{B}}$ -stable) if it admits a  $B$ -representation with associated  $\mathcal{B}$ -operators  $\{\mathcal{B}_{H:h}\}_{h \in [H]}$  such that

$$
\sup  _ {h \in [ H ]} \max  _ {\| \mathbf {q} \| * = 1} \| \mathcal {B} _ {H: h} \mathbf {q} \| _ {\Pi} \leqslant \Lambda_ {\mathrm {B}}. \tag {6}
$$

When using the B-stability condition, we will often take  $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{q}_1(\tau_{h - 1}) - \mathbf{q}_2(\tau_{h - 1})$  to be the difference between two predictive states at step  $h$ . Intuitively, Definition 4 requires that the propagated  $\Pi$ -norm error  $\| \mathcal{B}_{H:h}(\mathbf{q}_1 - \mathbf{q}_2)\|_{\Pi}$  to be controlled by the original fused-norm error  $\| \mathbf{q}_1 - \mathbf{q}_2\|_*$ .

The fused-norm  $\| \cdot \|_{*}$  is equivalent to the vector 1-norm up to a  $|\mathcal{U}_{A,h}|^{1 / 2}$ -factor (despite its seemingly involved form): We have  $\| \mathbf{q}\|_{*} \leqslant \| \mathbf{q}\|_{1} \leqslant |\mathcal{U}_{A,h}|^{1 / 2}\| \mathbf{q}\|_{*}$  (Lemma D.6), and thus assuming a relaxed condition  $\max_{\| \mathbf{q}\| _1 = 1}\| \mathcal{B}_{H:h}\|_{\Pi} \leqslant \Lambda$  will also enable sample-efficient learning of PSRs. However, we consider the fused-norm in order to obtain the sharpest possible sample complexity guarantees. Finally, all of our theoretical results still hold under a more relaxed (though less intuitive) weak  $B$ -stability condition (Definition D.4), with the same sample complexity guarantees. (See also the additional discussions in Appendix D.2.)

# 3.2 RELATION WITH KNOWN SAMPLE-EFFICIENT SUBCLASSES

We show that the B-stability condition encompasses many known structural conditions of PSRs and POMDPs that enable sample-efficient learning. Throughout, for a matrix  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ , we define its operator norm  $\| A \|_{p \to q} \coloneqq \max_{\| x \|_p \leqslant 1} \| Ax \|_q$ , and use  $\| A \|_p \coloneqq \| A \|_{p \to p}$  for shorthand.

Weakly revealing POMDPs (Jin et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2022a) is a subclass of POMDPs that assumes the current latent state can be probabilistically inferred from the next  $m$  emissions.

Example 5 (Multi-step weakly revealing POMDPs). A POMDP is called  $m$ -step  $\alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}$ -weakly revealing (henceforth also "  $\alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}$ -revealing") with  $\alpha_{\mathrm{rev}} \leqslant 1$  if  $\max_{h \in [H - m + 1]} \| \mathbb{M}_h^\dagger \|_{2 \to 2} \leqslant \alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}^{-1}$ , where  $\{\mathbb{M}_h \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{O}^m \mathcal{A}^{m - 1} \times \mathcal{S}}\}_{h \in [H - m + 1]}$  are the  $m$ -step emission-action matrices defined as

$$
\left[ \mathbb {M} _ {h} \right] _ {\left(\mathbf {o}, \mathbf {a}\right), s} := \mathbb {P} \left(o _ {h: h + m - 1} = \mathbf {o} \mid s _ {h} = s, a _ {h: h + m - 2} = \mathbf {a}\right), \forall (\mathbf {o}, \mathbf {a}) \in \mathcal {O} ^ {m} \times \mathcal {A} ^ {m - 1}, s \in S. \tag {7}
$$

We show that any  $m$ -step  $\alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}$ -weakly revealing POMDP is a  $\Lambda_{\mathsf{B}}$ -stable PSR with core test sets  $\mathcal{U}_h = (\mathcal{O} \times \mathcal{A})^{\min\{m-1, H-h\}} \times \mathcal{O}$ , and  $\Lambda_{\mathsf{B}} \leqslant \sqrt{S} \alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}^{-1}$  (Proposition D.7).

When the transition matrix  $\mathbb{T}_h$  of the POMDP has a low rank structure, Wang et al. (2022) show that a  $\ell_1$ -variant of the revealing condition—the future-sufficiency condition—enables sample-efficient learning of POMDPs with large state/observation spaces ( $\mathcal{S}$  and  $\mathcal{O}$  may be infinite). Such a condition is also assumed by Cai et al. (2022) for efficient learning of linear POMDPs.

Example 6 (Low-rank future-sufficient POMDPs). We say a POMDP has transition rank  $d_{\mathrm{trans}}$  if for each  $h \in [H - 1]$ , the transition kernel of the POMDP has factorization<sup>6</sup>

$$
\mathbb {T} _ {h} = \Psi_ {h} \Phi_ {h}, \qquad \Psi_ {h} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {\mathcal {S} \times d _ {\mathrm {t r a n s}}}, \qquad \Phi_ {h} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {\mathrm {t r a n s}} \times (\mathcal {S} \times \mathcal {A})},
$$

where  $(\Psi_h,\Phi_h)_{h\in [H]}$  satisfy standard normalization assumptions (24). A transition rank-  $d_{\mathrm{trans}}$  (henceforth rank-  $d_{\mathrm{trans}}$  ) POMDP is called  $m$  step  $\nu$  -future-sufficient with  $\nu \geqslant 1$  , if for  $h\in [H - 1]$ $\mathbb{M}_h\Psi_{h - 1}$  has full row rank, and  $\| \mathbb{M}_h^\sharp \| _1\to 1\leqslant \nu$  , where  $\mathbb{M}_h$  is the  $m$  -step emission-action matrix defined in (7), and  $\mathbb{M}_h^\sharp \coloneqq \Psi_{h - 1}(\mathbb{M}_h\Psi_{h - 1})^\dagger \in \mathbb{R}^{S\times \mathcal{U}_h}$

We show that any  $m$ -step  $\nu$ -weakly revealing rank- $d_{\mathrm{trans}}$  POMDP is a B-stable PSR with core test sets  $\mathcal{U}_h = (\mathcal{O} \times \mathcal{A})^{\min\{m-1, H-h\}} \times \mathcal{O}$ ,  $d_{\mathrm{PSR}} \leqslant d_{\mathrm{trans}}$ , and  $\Lambda_B \leqslant \sqrt{U_A} \nu$  (Proposition D.13).

Decodable POMDPs (Efroni et al., 2022), as a multi-step generalization of Block MDPs (Du et al., 2019), assumes the current latent state can be perfectly decoded from the recent  $m$  observations.

Example 7 (Multi-step decodable POMDPs). A POMDP is called  $m$ -step decodable if there exists (unknown) decoders  $\phi^{\star} = \{\phi_h^{\star}\}_{h\in [H]}$ , such that for every reachable trajectory  $(s_1,o_1,a_1,\dots ,s_h,o_h)$  we have  $s_h = \phi_h^\star (z_h)$ , where  $z_{h} = (o_{m(h)},a_{m(h)},\dots ,o_{h})$  and  $m(h) = \max \{h - m + 1,1\}$ . We show that any  $m$ -step decodable POMDP is a B-stable PSR with core test sets  $\mathcal{U}_h = (\mathcal{O}\times \mathcal{A})^{\min \{m - 1,H - h\}}\times \mathcal{O}$  and  $\Lambda_{\mathsf{B}} = 1$  (Proposition D.18).

Finally, Zhan et al. (2022) define the following regularity condition for general PSRs.

Example 8 (Regular PSRs). A PSR is called  $\alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}$ -regular if for all  $h \in [H]$  there exists a core matrix  $K_h \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_{h+1} \times \operatorname{rank}(D_h)}$ , which is a column-wise sub-matrix of  $D_h$  such that  $\operatorname{rank}(K_h) = \operatorname{rank}(D_h)$  and  $\max_{h \in [H]} \| K_h^\dagger \|_{1 \to 1} \leqslant \alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}^{-1}$ . We show that any  $\alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}$ -regular PSR is  $\Lambda_B$ -stable with  $\Lambda_B \leqslant \sqrt{U_A} \alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}^{-1}$  (Proposition D.19).

We emphasize that  $B$ -stability not only encompasses  $\alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}$ -regularity, but is also strictly more expressive. For example, decodable POMDPs are not  $\alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}$ -regular unless with additional assumptions on  $K_h^\dagger$  (Zhan et al., 2022, Section 6.5), whereas they are B-stable with  $\Lambda_{\mathsf{B}} = 1$  (Example 7). In general, the regular PSR assumption defined through matrix  $K_h^\dagger$  is more suitable for capturing revealing type structures, whereas B-stability naturally captures both revealing and decodable type structures.

# 4 LEARNING B-STABLE PSRS

In this section, we show that B-stable PSRs can be learned sample-efficiently, achieved by three model-based algorithms simultaneously. We instantiate our results to POMDPs in Section 5.

# 4.1 OPTIMISTIC MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION (OMLE)

The OMLE algorithm is proposed by Liu et al. (2022a) for learning revealing POMDPs and adapted<sup>7</sup> by Zhan et al. (2022) for learning regular PSRs, achieving polynomial sample complexity (in relevant problem parameters) in both cases. We show that OMLE works under the broader condition of B-stability, with significantly improved sample complexities.

Algorithm and theoretical guarantee The OMLE algorithm (described in Algorithm 1) takes in a class of PSRs  $\Theta$ , and performs two main steps in each iteration  $k \in [K]$ :

Algorithm 1 OPTIMISTIC MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION (OMLE)

1: Input: Model class  $\Theta$ , parameter  $\beta > 0$ .  
2: Initialize:  $\Theta^1 = \Theta, \mathcal{D} = \{\}$ .  
3: for iteration  $k = 1, \dots, K$  do  
4: Set  $(\theta^k,\pi^k) = \arg \max_{\theta \in \Theta^{k,\cdot}\pi}V_\theta (\pi)$  
5: for  $h = 0, \dots, H - 1$  do  
6: Set exploration policy  $\pi_{h,\exp}^k \coloneqq \pi^k \circ_h \operatorname{Unif}(\mathcal{A}) \circ_{h+1} \operatorname{Unif}(\mathcal{U}_{A,h+1})$ .  
7: Execute  $\pi_{h,\exp}^k$  to collect a trajectory  $\tau^{k,h}$ , and add  $(\pi_{h,\exp}^k, \tau^{k,h})$  into  $\mathcal{D}$ .  
8: Update confidence set

$$
\Theta^ {k + 1} = \left\{\widehat {\theta} \in \Theta : \sum_ {(\pi , \tau) \in \mathcal {D}} \log \mathbb {P} _ {\widehat {\theta}} ^ {\pi} (\tau) \geqslant \max  _ {\theta \in \Theta} \sum_ {(\pi , \tau) \in \mathcal {D}} \log \mathbb {P} _ {\theta} ^ {\pi} (\tau) - \beta \right\}.
$$

Output:  $\widehat{\pi}_{\mathrm{out}} := \operatorname{Unif}(\{\pi^k\}_{k \in [K]})$ .

1. (Optimism) Construct a confidence set  $\Theta^k \subseteq \Theta$ , which is a superlevel set of the log-likelihood of all trajectories within dataset  $\mathcal{D}$  (Line 8). The policy  $\pi^k$  is then chosen as the greedy policy with respect to the most optimistic model within  $\Theta^k$  (Line 4).  
2. (Data collection) Execute exploration policies  $(\pi_{h,\exp}^{k})_{0\leqslant h\leqslant H - 1}$ , where each  $\pi_{h,\exp}^{k}$  follows  $\pi^k$  for the first  $h - 1$  steps, takes a uniform action  $\mathrm{Unif}(\mathcal{A})$  at step  $h$ , takes an action sequence sampled from  $\mathrm{Unif}(\mathcal{U}_{A,h + 1})$  at step  $h + 1$ , and behaves arbitrarily afterwards (Line 6). All collected trajectories are then added into  $\mathcal{D}$  (Line 7).

Intuitively, the concatenation of the current policy  $\pi^k$  with  $\mathrm{Unif}(\mathcal{A})$  and  $\mathrm{Unif}(\mathcal{U}_{A,h+1})$  in Step 2 above is designed according to the structure of PSRs to foster exploration.

Theorem 9 (Guarantee of OMLE). Suppose every  $\theta \in \Theta$  is  $\Lambda_{\mathsf{B}}$ -stable (Definition 4) and the true model  $\theta^{\star} \in \Theta$  has rank  $d_{\mathsf{PSR}} \leqslant d$ . Then, choosing  $\beta = C \log (\mathcal{N}_{\Theta}(1 / KH) / \delta)$  for some absolute constant  $C > 0$ , with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ , Algorithm 1 outputs a policy  $\widehat{\pi}_{\mathrm{out}} \in \Delta(\Pi)$  such that  $V_{\star} - V_{\theta^{\star}}(\widehat{\pi}_{\mathrm{out}}) \leqslant \varepsilon$ , as long as the number of episodes

$$
T = K H \geqslant \mathcal {O} \left(d A U _ {A} H ^ {2} \log \left(\mathcal {N} _ {\Theta} (1 / T) / \delta\right) \iota \cdot \Lambda_ {\mathrm {B}} ^ {2} / \varepsilon^ {2}\right), \tag {8}
$$

where  $\iota := \log \left(1 + K d \Lambda_{\mathsf{B}} R_{\mathsf{B}} \kappa_d\right)$ , with  $R_{\mathsf{B}} := \max_h \left\{1, \max_{\|v\|_1 = 1} \sum_{o,a} \| \mathbf{B}_h(o,a)v\|_1\right\}$  and  $\kappa_d := \max_{h \in [H]} \min \left\{\|F_1\|_{1 \to 1} \|F_2\|_{1 \to 1}: D_h = F_1F_2, F_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}_h \times d}, F_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times \mathcal{T}^{h-1}}\right\}$ .

Theorem 9 shows that OMLE is sample-efficient for any B-stable PSRs—a broader class than in existing results for the same algorithm (Liu et al., 2022a; Zhan et al., 2022)—with much sharper sample complexities than existing work when instantiated to their settings. Importantly, we achieve the first polynomial sample complexity that scales with  $\Lambda_{\mathrm{B}}^{2}$  dependence B-stability parameter (or regularity parameters alike<sup>8</sup>). Instantiating to  $\alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}$ -regular PSRs, using  $\Lambda_{\mathrm{B}} \leqslant \sqrt{U_A} \alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}^{-1}$  (Example 8), our result implies a  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(dAU_A^2 \log \mathcal{N}_{\Theta} / (\alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}^2 \varepsilon^2))$  sample complexity (ignoring  $H$  and  $\iota^9$ ). This improves significantly over the  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^4 A^4 U_A^9 \log (\mathcal{N}_{\Theta} O) / (\alpha_{\mathrm{psr}}^6 \varepsilon^2))$  result of Zhan et al. (2022).

Overview of techniques The proof of Theorem 9 (deferred to Appendix G) builds upon a sharp analysis for B-stable PSRs: 1) We use a more delicate choice of norm for bounding the errors (in the B operators) yielded from performance difference arguments; 2) We develop a generalized  $\ell_2$ -type Eluder argument that is sharper than the  $\ell_1$ -Eluder argument of Liu et al. (2022a); Zhan et al. (2022). A more detailed overview of techniques is presented in Appendix B.

# 4.2 EXPLORATIVE ESTIMATION-TO-DECISIONS (EXPLORATIVE E2D)

Estimation-To-Decisions (E2D) is a general model-based algorithm that is sample-efficient for any interactive decision making problem (including MDPs) with a bounded Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC), as established in the DEC framework by Foster et al. (2021). However, the E2D algorithm has not been instantiated on POMDPs/PSRs. We show that B-stable PSRs admit a sharp DEC bound, and thus can be learned sample-efficiently by a suitable E2D algorithm.

EDEC & EXPLORATIVE E2D algorithm We consider the Explorative DEC (EDEC) proposed in the recent work of Chen et al. (2022), which for a PSR class  $\Theta$  is defined as

$$
\overline {{\operatorname {e d e c}}} _ {\gamma} (\Theta) = \sup  _ {\bar {\mu} \in \Delta (\Theta)} \inf  _ {\substack {p _ {\exp} \in \Delta (\Pi) \\ p _ {\text {out}} \in \Delta (\Pi)}} \sup  _ {\theta \in \Theta} \left\{\mathbb {E} _ {\pi \sim p _ {\text {out}}} [ V _ {\theta} (\pi_ {\theta}) - V _ {\theta} (\pi) ] - \gamma \mathbb {E} _ {\pi \sim p _ {\text {exp}}} \mathbb {E} _ {\bar {\theta} \sim \bar {\mu}} \left[ D _ {\mathrm {H}} ^ {2} \left(\mathbb {P} _ {\theta} ^ {\pi}, \mathbb {P} _ {\bar {\theta}} ^ {\pi}\right) \right] \right\}, \tag{9}
$$

where  $D_{\mathrm{H}}^{2}(\mathbb{P}_{\theta}^{\pi},\mathbb{P}_{\bar{\theta}}^{\pi})\coloneqq \sum_{\tau_{H}}(\mathbb{P}_{\theta}^{\pi}(\tau_{H})^{1 / 2} - \mathbb{P}_{\bar{\theta}}^{\pi}(\tau_{H})^{1 / 2})^{2}$  denotes the squared Hellinger distance between  $\mathbb{P}_{\theta}^{\pi}$  and  $\mathbb{P}_{\bar{\theta}}^{\pi}$ . Intuitively, the EDEC measures the optimal trade-off on model class  $\Theta$  between gaining information by an "exploration policy"  $\pi \sim p_{\mathrm{exp}}$  and achieving near-optimality by an "output policy"  $\pi \sim p_{\mathrm{out}}$ . Chen et al. (2022) further design the EXPLORATIVE E2D algorithm, a general model-based RL algorithm with sample complexity scaling with the EDEC.

We sketch the EXPLORATIVE E2D algorithm for a PSR class  $\Theta$  as follows (full description in Algorithm 2): In each episode  $t\in [T]$ , we maintain a distribution  $\mu^t\in \Delta (\Theta_0)$  over an optimistic cover  $(\widetilde{\mathbb{P}},\Theta_0)$  of  $\Theta$  with radius  $1 / T$  (cf. Definition C.4), which we use to compute two policy distributions  $(p_{\mathrm{exp}}^{t},p_{\mathrm{out}}^{t})$  by minimizing the following risk:

$$
(p _ {\mathrm {o u t}} ^ {t}, p _ {\mathrm {e x p}} ^ {t}) = \underset {(p _ {\mathrm {o u t}}, p _ {\mathrm {e x p}}) \in \Delta (\Pi) ^ {2}} {\arg \min} \sup _ {\theta \in \Theta} \mathbb {E} _ {\pi \sim p _ {\mathrm {o u t}}} [ V _ {\theta} (\pi_ {\theta}) - V _ {\theta} (\pi) ] - \gamma \mathbb {E} _ {\pi \sim p _ {\mathrm {e x p}}} \mathbb {E} _ {\theta^ {t} \sim \mu^ {t}} [ D _ {\mathrm {H}} ^ {2} (\mathbb {P} _ {\theta} ^ {\pi}, \mathbb {P} _ {\theta^ {t}} ^ {\pi}) ].
$$

Then, we sample policy  $\pi^t\sim p_{\mathrm{exp}}^t$  , execute  $\pi^t$  and collect trajectory  $\tau^t$  , and update the model distribution using a Tempered Aggregation scheme, which performs a Hedge update with initialization  $\mu^1 = \mathrm{Unif}(\Theta_0)$  , the log-likelihood loss with  $\widetilde{\mathbb{P}}_{\theta}^{\pi^t}(\cdot)$  denoting the optimistic likelihood associated with model  $\theta \in \Theta_0$  and policy  $\pi^t$  (cf. Definition C.4), and learning rate  $\eta \leqslant 1 / 2$  ..

$$
\mu^ {t + 1} (\theta) \propto_ {\theta} \mu^ {t} (\theta) \cdot \exp \left(\eta \log \widetilde {\mathbb {P}} _ {\theta} ^ {\pi} ^ {t} (\tau^ {t})\right).
$$

After  $T$  episodes, we output the average policy  $\hat{\pi}_{\mathrm{out}} := \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} p_{\mathrm{out}}^t$ .

Theoretical guarantee We provide a sharp bound on the EDEC for B-stable PSRs, which implies that EXPLORATIVE E2D can also learn them sample-efficient efficiently.

Theorem 10 (Bound on EDEC & Guarantee of EXPLORATIVE E2D). Suppose  $\Theta$  is a PSR class with the same core test sets  $\{\mathcal{U}_h\}_{h\in [H]}$ , and each  $\theta \in \Theta$  admits a  $B$ -representation that is  $\Lambda_{\mathrm{B}}$ -stable and has PSR rank at most  $d$ . Then we have

$$
\overline {{\operatorname {e d e c}}} _ {\gamma} (\Theta) \leqslant \mathcal {O} (d A U _ {A} \Lambda_ {\mathrm {B}} ^ {2} H ^ {2} / \gamma).
$$

As a corollary, with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ , Algorithm 2 outputs a policy  $\widehat{\pi}_{\mathrm{out}} \in \Delta(\Pi)$  such that  $V_{\star} - V_{\theta^{\star}}(\widehat{\pi}_{\mathrm{out}}) \leqslant \varepsilon$ , as long as the number of episodes

$$
T \geqslant \mathcal {O} \left(d A U _ {A} \Lambda_ {\mathrm {B}} ^ {2} H ^ {2} \log \left(\mathcal {N} _ {\Theta} (1 / T) / \delta\right) / \varepsilon^ {2}\right). \tag {10}
$$

The sample complexity (10) matches OMLE (Theorem 9) and has a slight advantage in avoiding the log factor  $\iota$  therein. In return, the  $d$  in Theorem 10 needs to upper bound the PSR rank of all models in  $\Theta$ , whereas the  $d$  in Theorem 9 only needs to upper bound the rank of the true model  $\theta^*$ . We also remark that EXPLORATIVE E2D explicitly requires an optimistic covering of  $\Theta$  as an input to the algorithm, which may be another disadvantage compared to OMLE (which uses optimistic covering implicitly in the analyses only). The proof of Theorem 10 (in Appendix I.2) relies on mostly the same key steps as for analyzing the OMLE algorithm (overview in Appendix B).

Extension: Reward-free learning Chen et al. (2022) also propose the REWARD-FREE E2D algorithm for reward-free RL, which achieves sample complexity scaling with the Reward-Free DEC (RFDEC). We show that for B-stable PSRs, the RFDEC (43) can be upper bounded similar to the EDEC, and thus REWARD-FREE E2D (Algorithm 3) can be used to learn stable PSRs in a reward-free manner (Theorem H.4 & Appendix H.2).

# 4.3 MODEL-BASED OPTIMISTIC POSTERIOR SAMPLING (MOPS)

Finally, we show that MOPS—a general model-based algorithm originally proposed for MDPs by Agarwal & Zhang (2022)—can learn B-stable PSRs with the same sample complexity as OMLE and EXPLORATIVE E2D modulo minor differences (Theorem H.6 & Appendix H.3). The analysis is parallel to that of EXPLORATIVE E2D, building on insights from Chen et al. (2022).

# 5 EXAMPLES: SAMPLE COMPLEXITY OF LEARNING POMDPS

We illustrate the sample complexity of OMLE and EXPLORATIVE E2D given in Theorem 9 & 10 (with MOPS giving similar results) for learning an  $\varepsilon$  near-optimal policy in the tractable POMDP subclasses presented in Section 3.2, and compare with existing results.

Weakly revealing tabular POMDPs  $m$ -step  $\alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}$ -weakly revealing tabular POMDPs are B-stable PSRs with  $\Lambda_{\mathrm{B}} \leqslant \sqrt{S} \alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}^{-1}$ ,  $d_{\mathrm{PSR}} \leqslant S$ , and  $U_{A} \leqslant A^{m-1}$  (Example 5). Further, the log-factor  $\iota$  in Theorem 9 satisfies  $\iota \leqslant \mathcal{O}(\log (AU_A \alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}^{-1})) = \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$  (Appendix D.3.1). Therefore, both Theorem 9 & 10 achieve sample complexity

$$
\widetilde {\mathcal {O}} \big (S A ^ {m} H ^ {2} \log \mathcal {N} _ {\Theta} \cdot \Lambda_ {\mathsf {B}} ^ {2} / \varepsilon^ {2} \big) \leqslant \widetilde {\mathcal {O}} \big (S ^ {2} A ^ {m} H ^ {2} \log \mathcal {N} _ {\Theta} / (\alpha_ {\mathrm {r e v}} ^ {2} \varepsilon^ {2}) \big),
$$

This improves substantially over the current best result  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(S^4 A^{6m-4} H^6 \log \mathcal{N}_{\Theta} / (\alpha_{\mathrm{rev}}^4 \varepsilon^2))$  of Liu et al. (2022a, Theorem 24). For tabular POMDPs, we further have  $\log \mathcal{N}_{\Theta} \leqslant \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H(S^2 A + SO))$ .

Low-rank future-sufficient POMDPs  $m$ -step  $\nu$ -future-sufficient rank- $d_{\mathrm{trans}}$  POMDPs are B-stable PSRs with  $\Lambda_{\mathsf{B}} \leqslant \sqrt{U_A} \nu$ ,  $d_{\mathrm{PSR}} \leqslant d_{\mathrm{trans}}$ , and  $U_A \leqslant A^{m-1}$  (Example 6). Further, the log-factor  $\iota$  in Theorem 9 satisfies  $\iota \leqslant \mathcal{O}(\log(d_{\mathrm{trans}}AU_A\nu)) = \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$  (Appendix D.3.3). Therefore, Theorem 9 & 10 achieve sample complexity

$$
\widetilde {\mathcal {O}} \left(d _ {\text {t r a n s}} A ^ {m} H ^ {2} \log \mathcal {N} _ {\Theta} \cdot \Lambda_ {\mathrm {B}} ^ {2} / \varepsilon^ {2}\right) \leqslant \widetilde {\mathcal {O}} \left(d _ {\text {t r a n s}} A ^ {2 m - 1} H ^ {2} \log \mathcal {N} _ {\Theta} \cdot \nu^ {2} / \varepsilon^ {2}\right).
$$

This improves substantially over the  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d_{\mathrm{trans}}^{2}A^{5m + 3l + 1}H^{2}(\log \mathcal{N}_{\Theta})^{2}\cdot \nu^{4}\gamma^{2} / \varepsilon^{2})$  achieved by Wang et al. (2022), which requires an extra  $l$ -step  $\gamma$ -past-sufficiency assumption that we do not require.

Decodable low-rank POMDPs  $m$ -step decodable POMDPs with transition rank  $d_{\mathrm{trans}}$  are B-stable PSRs with  $\Lambda_{\mathsf{B}} = 1$ ,  $d_{\mathrm{PSR}} \leqslant d_{\mathrm{trans}} \leqslant S$ , and  $U_{A} \leqslant A^{m - 1}$  (Example 7). Further, the log-factor  $\iota$  in Theorem 9 satisfies  $\iota \leqslant \mathcal{O}(\log (d_{\mathrm{trans}}AU_A)) = \tilde{\mathcal{O}} (1)$  (Appendix D.3.5). Therefore, Theorem 9 & 10 achieve sample complexity

$$
\tilde {\mathcal {O}} \left(d _ {\text {t r a n s}} A ^ {m} H ^ {2} \log \mathcal {N} _ {\Theta} / \varepsilon^ {2}\right).
$$

Compared with the  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d_{\mathrm{trans}}A^mH^2\log\mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{G}}/\varepsilon^2)$  result of Efroni et al. (2022), the only difference is that their covering number  $\mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{G}}$  is for the value class while  $\mathcal{N}_{\Theta}$  is for the model class. However, this difference is nontrivial if the model class admits a much smaller covering number than the value class required for a concrete problem. For example, for tabular decodable POMDPs, using  $d_{\mathrm{trans}} \leqslant S$  and  $\log \mathcal{N}_{\Theta} \leqslant \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H(S^2A + SO))$ , we achieve the first  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(A^m\mathrm{poly}(H,S,O,A)/\varepsilon^2)$  sample complexity, which resolves the open question of Efroni et al. (2022).

Additional examples Besides the above, our results can be further instantiated to latent MDPs (Kwon et al. (2021), as a special case of revealing POMDPs) and linear POMDPs (Cai et al., 2022) and improve over existing results, which we present in Appendix D.3.2 & D.3.4.

# 6 CONCLUSION

This paper proposes B-stability—a new structural condition for PSRs that encompasses most of the known tractable partially observable RL problems—and designs algorithms for learning B-stable PSRs with sharp sample complexities. We believe our work opens up many interesting questions, such as the computational efficiency of our algorithms, alternative (e.g. model-free) approaches for learning B-stable PSRs, or extensions to multi-agent settings.
