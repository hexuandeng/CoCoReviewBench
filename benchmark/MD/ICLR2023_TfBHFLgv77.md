# ABSTRACT

In deep reinforcement learning (RL), useful information about the state is inherently tied to its possible future successors. Consequently, encoding features that capture the hierarchical relationships between states into the model's latent representations is often conducive to recovering effective policies. In this work, we study a new class of deep RL algorithms that promote encoding such relationships by using hyperbolic space to model latent representations. However, we find that a naive application of existing methodology from the hyperbolic deep learning literature leads to fatal instabilities due to the non-stationarity and variance characterizing common gradient estimators in RL. Hence, we design a new general method that directly addresses such optimization challenges and enables stable end-to-end learning with deep hyperbolic representations. We empirically validate our framework by applying it to popular on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms on the Progen and Atari 100K benchmarks, attaining near universal performance and generalization benefits. Given its natural fit, we hope this work will inspire future RL research to consider hyperbolic representations as a standard tool.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Reinforcement Learning (RL) achieved notable milestones in several game-playing and robotics applications (Mnih et al., 2013; Vinyals et al., 2019; Kalashnikov et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2021). However, all these recent advances relied on large amounts of data and domain-specific practices, restricting their applicability in many important real-world contexts (Dulac-Arnold et al., 2019). We argue that these challenges are symptomatic of current deep RL models lacking a proper prior to efficiently learn generalizable features for control (Kirk et al., 2021). We propose to tackle this issue by introducing hyperbolic geometry to RL, as a

Figure 1: Hierarchical relationship between states in breakout, visualized in hyperbolic space. New inductive bias for representation learning.

Sequential decision-making problems require reasoning about the effect actions have on the environment. Intuitively, the evolution of the state in a Markov decision process can be conceptualized as a tree (e.g., Fig. 1), with the policy and dynamics determining the different branching paths. Thus, hierarchy often provides a natural basis to encode useful information about the structure of an RL problem (Flet-Berliac, 2019). Consequently, we hypothesize that the inductive priors of deep RL models should prioritize encoding hierarchically-structured features to facilitate learning effective and generalizable policies. In contrast, non-evolving features such as the aesthetic properties of elements in the observed trajectories, are often linked with spurious correlations, hindering generalization to new observations (Song et al., 2019; Bertran et al., 2020). Analogously, human cognition also appears to learn representations of actions and elements of the surrounding environment by focusing on their underlying hierarchical relationship (Barker & Wright, 1955; Zhou et al., 2018).

Hyperbolic geometry (Beltrami, 1868; Cannon et al., 1997) provides a natural choice to efficiently encode hierarchically-structured features. A defining property of hyperbolic space is exponential volume growth, which enables the embedding of tree-like hierarchical data with low distortion using only a few dimensions (Sarkar, 2011). In contrast, the volume of Euclidean spaces only grows polynomially, requiring high dimensionality to precisely embed tree structures (Matoušek, 1990),

potentially leading to higher complexity, more parameters, and overfitting. We analyze the properties of learned RL representations using a measure based on the  $\delta$ -hyperbolicity (Gromov, 1987), quantifying how close an arbitrary metric space is to a hyperbolic one. In line with our intuition, we show that performance improvements of RL algorithms correlate with the increasing hyperbolicity of the discrete space spanned by their latent representations. This result validates the importance of appropriately encoding hierarchical information, suggesting that the inductive bias provided by employing hyperbolic representations would facilitate recovering effective solutions.

Hyperbolic geometry has recently been exploited in other areas of machine learning showing substantial performance and efficiency benefits for learning representations of hierarchical and graph data (Nickel & Kiela, 2017; Chamberlain et al., 2017). Recent contributions further extended tools from modern deep learning to work in hyperbolic space (Ganea et al., 2018; Shimizu et al., 2020), validating their effectiveness in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks (Khrulkov et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022; Nagano et al., 2019; Mathieu et al., 2019; Bose et al., 2020). However, most of these approaches showed clear improvements on smaller-scale problems that failed to hold when scaling to higher-dimensional datasets and representation sizes. Many of these shortcomings are tied to the practical challenges of optimizing hyperbolic and Euclidean parameters end-to-end (Guo et al., 2022). In RL, We show the non-stationarity and high-variance characterizing common gradient estimators exacerbates these issues, making a naive incorporation of hyperbolic layers with existing techniques yield underwhelming results.

In this work, we overcome the aforementioned challenges and effectively train deep RL algorithms with latent hyperbolic representations end-to-end. In particular, we design spectrally-regularized hyperbolic mappings (S-RYM), a simple recipe combining scaling and spectral normalization (Miyato et al., 2018) that stabilizes the learned hyperbolic representations and enables their seamless integration with deep RL models. We apply S-RYM to build hyperbolic versions of both on-policy (Schulman et al., 2017) and off-policy algorithms (Hessel et al., 2018), and evaluate on both Progen (Cobbe et al., 2020) and Atari 100K benchmarks (Bellemare et al., 2013). We show that our framework attains near universal performance and generalization improvements over established Euclidean baselines, making even general algorithms competitive with highly-tuned SotA baselines. We hope our work will set a new standard and be the first of many incorporating hyperbolic representations with RL. To this end, we share our implementation to facilitate future extensions.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

In this section, we introduce the main definitions required for the remainder of the paper. We refer to App. A and (Cannon et al., 1997) for further details about RL and hyperbolic space, respectively.

# 2.1 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

The RL problem setting is traditionally described as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by the tuple  $(S, A, P, p_0, r, \gamma)$ . At each timestep  $t$ , an agent interacts with the environment, observing some state from the state space  $s \in S$ , executing some action from its action space  $a \in A$ , and receiving some reward according to its reward function  $r: S \times A \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ . The transition dynamics  $P: S \times A \times S \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  and initial state distribution  $p_0: S \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  determine the evolution of the environment's state while the discount factor  $\gamma \in [0, 1)$  quantifies the agent's preference for earlier rewards. Agent behavior in RL can be represented by a parameterized distribution function  $\pi_\theta$ , whose sequential interaction with the environment yields some trajectory  $\tau = (s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \dots, s_T, a_T)$ . The agent's objective is to learn a policy maximizing its expected discounted sum of rewards over trajectories:

$$
\underset {\theta} {\arg \max } \mathbb {E} _ {\tau \sim \pi_ {\theta}, P} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \gamma^ {t} r \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) \right]. \tag {1}
$$

We differentiate two main classes of RL algorithms with very different optimization procedures based on their different usage of the collected data. On-policy algorithms collect a new set of trajectories with the latest policy for each training iteration, discarding old data. In contrast, off-policy algorithms maintain a large replay buffer of past experiences and use it for learning useful quantities about the environment, such as world models and value functions. Two notable instances from each class are Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) and Rainbow DQN (Hessel et al., 2018), upon which many recent advances have been built upon.

# 2.2 MACHINE LEARNING IN HYPERBOLIC SPACES

A hyperbolic space  $\mathbb{H}^n$  is an  $n$ -dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant negative sectional curvature  $-c$ . Beltrami (1868) showed the equiconsistency of hyperbolic and Euclidean geometry using a model named after its re-discoverer, the Poincaré ball model. This model equips an  $n$ -dimensional open ball  $\mathbb{B}^n = \{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n : c\|\mathbf{x}\| < 1\}$  of radius  $1/\sqrt{c}$  with a conformal metric of the form  $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{x}} = \lambda_{\mathbf{x}}^2\mathbf{I}$ , where  $\lambda_{\mathbf{x}} = \frac{2}{1 - c\|\mathbf{x}\|^2}$  is the conformal factor (we will omit the dependence on the curvature  $-c$  in our definitions for notation brevity). The geodesic (shortest path) between two points in this metric is a circular arc perpendicular to the boundary with the length given by:

$$
d (\mathbf {x}, \mathbf {y}) = \frac {1}{\sqrt {c}} \cosh^ {- 1} \left(1 + 2 c \frac {\| \mathbf {x} - \mathbf {y} \| ^ {2}}{\left(1 - c \| \mathbf {x} \| ^ {2}\right) \left(1 - c \| \mathbf {y} \| ^ {2}\right)}\right). \tag {2}
$$

From these characteristics, hyperbolic spaces can be viewed as a continuous analog of trees. In particular, the volume of a ball on  $\mathbb{H}^n$  grows exponentially w.r.t. its radius. This property mirrors the exponential node growth in trees with constant branching factors. Visually, this makes geodesics between distinct points pass through some midpoint with lower magnitude, analogously to how tree geodesics between nodes (defined as the shortest path in their graph) must cross their closest shared parent (Fig. 2).

Key operations for learning. On a Riemannian manifold, the exponential map  $\exp_x(\mathbf{v})$  outputs a unit step along a geodesic starting from point  $x$  in the direction of an input velocity  $\mathbf{v}$ . It thus allows locally treating  $\mathbb{H}^n$  as Euclidean space. We use the exponential map from the origin of the Poincaré ball to map Euclidean input vectors  $v$  into  $\mathbb{H}^n$ ,

Figure 2: Geodesics on  $\mathbb{H}^2$  and shortest paths connecting nodes of a tree.

$$
\exp_ {\mathbf {0}} (\mathbf {v}) = \tanh  \left(\sqrt {c} \| \mathbf {v} \|\right) \frac {\mathbf {v}}{\sqrt {c} \| \mathbf {v} \|}. \tag {3}
$$

Following Ganea et al. (2018), we consider the framework of gyrovector spaces (Ungar, 2008) to extend common vector operations to non-Euclidean geometries, and in particular  $\mathbb{H}^n$ . The most basic such generalized operation is the Mobius addition  $\oplus$  of two vectors,

$$
\mathbf {x} \oplus \mathbf {y} = \frac {\left(1 + 2 \mathbf {x} \langle \mathbf {x} , \mathbf {y} \rangle + c \| \mathbf {y} \| ^ {2}\right) \mathbf {x} + \left(1 + c \| \mathbf {x} \| ^ {2}\right) \mathbf {y}}{1 + 2 c \langle \mathbf {x} , \mathbf {y} \rangle + c ^ {2} \| \mathbf {x} \| ^ {2} \| \mathbf {y} \| ^ {2}}. \tag {4}
$$

Next, consider a Euclidean affine transformation  $f(\mathbf{x}) = \langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{w}\rangle +b$  used in typical neural network layers. We can rewrite this transformation as  $f(\mathbf{x}) = \langle \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p},\mathbf{w}\rangle$  and interpret  $\mathbf{w},\mathbf{p}\in \mathbb{R}^d$  as the normal and shift parameters of a hyperplane  $H = \{\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^d:\langle \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{p},\mathbf{w}\rangle = 0\}$  (Lebanon & Lafferty, 2004). This allows us to further rewrite  $f(\mathbf{x})$  in terms of the signed distance to the hyperplane  $H$ , effectively acting as a weighted 'decision boundary':

$$
f (\mathbf {x}) = \operatorname {s i g n} \left(\langle \mathbf {x} - \mathbf {p}, \mathbf {w} \rangle\right) \| \mathbf {w} \| d (\mathbf {x}, H). \tag {5}
$$

This formulation allows to extend affine transformations to the Poincaré ball by considering the signed distance from a gyroplane in  $\mathbb{B}^d$  (generalized hyperplane)  $H = \{\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{B}^d : \langle \mathbf{y} \oplus -\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{w} \rangle = 0\}$ ,

$$
f (\mathbf {x}) = \operatorname {s i g n} \left(\left\langle \mathbf {x} \oplus - \mathbf {p w} \right\rangle\right) \frac {2 \| \mathbf {w} \|}{\sqrt {1 - c \| \mathbf {p} \| ^ {2}}} d (\mathbf {x}, H); d (\mathbf {x}, H) = \frac {1}{\sqrt {c}} \sinh^ {- 1} \left(\frac {2 \sqrt {c} | \langle \mathbf {x} \oplus - \mathbf {p} , \mathbf {w} \rangle |}{\left(1 - c \| \mathbf {x} \oplus - \mathbf {p} \| ^ {2}\right) \| \mathbf {w} \|}\right) \tag {6}
$$

In line with recent use of hyperbolic geometry in supervised (Khrulkov et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022) and unsupervised (Nagano et al., 2019; Mathieu et al., 2019) deep learning, we employ these operations to parameterize hybrid neural networks: we first process the input data  $\mathbf{x}$  with standard layers to produce some Euclidean velocity vectors  $\mathbf{x}_E = f_E(\mathbf{x})$ . Then, we obtain our hyperbolic representations by applying the exponential map  $\mathbf{x}_H = \exp_0(\mathbf{x}_E)$ . Finally, we employ affine transformations  $\{f_i\}$  of the form 6 to output the set of policy and value scalars with  $f_{H}(\mathbf{x}_{H}) = \{f_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{H})\}$ .

# 3 HYPERBOLIC REPRESENTATIONS FOR REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

In this section, we base our empirical RL analysis on Progen (Cobbe et al., 2020). This benchmark consists of 16 visual environments, with procedurally-generated random levels. Following common practice, we train agents using exclusively the first 200 levels of each environment and evaluate on the full distribution of levels to assess agent performance and generalization.

We illustrate the necessary  $\delta$  to satisfy this property for  $\triangle ABC$  in a tree triangle (Left), a hyperbolic triangle (Center) and an Euclidean triangle (Right); sharing vertex coordinates. In tree triangles,  $\delta_{tree} = 0$  since  $\overline{AC}$  always intersects both  $\overline{AB}$  and  $\overline{BC}$ .

# 3.1 THE INHERENT HYPERBOLICITY OF DEEP RL

Key quantities for each state, such as the value and the policy, are naturally related to its possible successors. In contrast, other fixed, non-hierarchical information about the environment such as its general appearance, can often be safely ignored. This divide becomes particularly relevant when considering the problem of RL generalization. For instance, Raileanu & Fergus (2021) found that agents' can overfit to spurious correlations between the value and non-hierarchical features (e.g., background color) in the observed states. Hence, we hypothesize that effective representations should encode features directly related to the hierarchical state relationships of MDPs.

$\delta$ -hyperbolicity. We analyze the representation spaces learned by RL agents, testing whether they preserve and reflect this hierarchical structure. We use the  $\delta$ -hyperbolicity of a metric space  $(X,d)$  (Gromov, 1987; Bonk & Schramm, 2011), which we formally describe in App. A.2. For our use-case,  $X$  is  $\delta$ -hyperbolic if every possible geodesic triangle  $\triangle xyz \in X$  is  $\delta$ -slim. This means that for every point on any side of  $\triangle xyz$  there exists some point on one of the other sides whose distance is at most  $\delta$ . In trees, every point belongs to at least two of its sides yielding  $\delta = 0$  (Figure 3). Thus, we can interpret  $\delta$ -hyperbolicity as measuring the deviation of a given metric from an exact tree metric.

The representations learned by an RL agent from encoding the collected states span some finite subset of Euclidean space  $\mathbf{x}_E \in X_E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ , yielding a discrete metric space  $X_E$ . To test our hypothesis, we compute the  $\delta$ -hyperbolicity of  $X_E$  and analyze how it relates to agent performance. Similarly to (Khrulkov et al., 2020), we compute  $\delta$  using the efficient algorithm proposed by Fournier et al. (2015). To account for the scale of the representations, we normalize  $\delta$  by  $\mathrm{diam}(X_E)$ , yielding a relative hyperbolicity measure  $\delta_{rel} = 2\delta/\mathrm{diam}(X_E)$  (Borassi et al., 2015), which can span values between 0 (hyperbolic hierarchical tree-like structure) and 1 (perfectly non-hyperbolic spaces).

Results. We train an agent with PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) on four Procgen environments, encoding states from the latest rollouts using the representations before the final linear policy and value heads,  $x_{E} = f_{E}(s)$ . Hence, we estimate  $\delta_{rel}$  from the space spanned by these latent encodings as training progresses. As shown in Figure 4,  $\delta_{rel}$  quickly drops to low values (0.22 - 0.28) in the first training iterations, reflecting the largest relative improvements in agent performance. Subsequently, in the fruitbot and starpilot environments,  $\delta_{rel}$  further decreases throughout training as the agent recovers high performance with a low generalization gap between the training and test distribution of levels. Instead, in bigfish and dodgeball,  $\delta_{rel}$  begins to increase again after the initial drop, suggesting that the latent representation space starts losing its hierarchical structure. Correspondingly, the agent starts overfitting as test levels performance stagnates while the generalization gap with the training levels performance keeps increasing. These results validate our hypothesis, empirically showing the importance of encoding hierarchical features for recovering effective solutions. Fur

thermore, they suggest that PPO's poor generalization in some environments is due to the observed tendency of the Euclidean latent space to encode spurious features that hinder its hyperbolicity.

Motivated by our findings, we propose employing hyperbolic geometry to model the latent representations of deep RL models. Representing tree-metrics in Euclidean spaces incurs non-trivial worse-case distortions, growing with the number of nodes at a rate dependent on the dimensionality (Matoušek, 1990). This property suggests that it is not possible to encode complex hierarchies in Euclidean space both efficiently and accurately, explaining why some solutions learned by PPO could not maintain their hyperbolicity throughout training. In contrast, mapping the latent representations to hyperbolic spaces of any dimensionality enables encoding features exhibiting a tree-structured relation over the data with arbitrarily low distortion (Sarkar, 2011). Hence, hyperbolic latent representations introduce a different inductive bias for modeling the policy and value function, stemming from this inherent efficiency of specifically encoding hierarchical information (Tifrea et al., 2018).

# 3.2 OPTIMIZATION CHALLENGES

Naive integration. We test a simple extension to PPO, mapping the latent representations of states  $s \in S$  before the final linear policy and value heads  $x_{E} = f_{E}(s)$  to the Poincaré ball with unitary curvature. As described in Section 2, we perform this with an exponential map to produce  $x_{H} = \exp_{0}^{1}(x_{E})$ , replacing the final ReLU. To output the value and policy logits, we then finally perform a set of affine transformations in hyperbolic space,  $\pi(s), V(s) = f_{H}(x_{H}) = \{f_{i}^{1}(x_{H})\}_{i=0}^{|A|}$ . We also consider a clipped version of this integration, following the recent stabilization practice from Guo et al. (2022), which entails clipping the magnitude of the latent representations to not exceed unit norm. We initialize the weights of the last two linear layers in both implementations to  $100 \times$  smaller values to start training with low magnitude latent representations, which facilitates the network first learning appropriate angular layouts (Nickel & Kiela, 2017; Ganea et al., 2018).

Results. We analyze this naive hyperbolic PPO implementation in Figure 6. As shown in part (A.1), performance is gener-

ally underwhelming, lagging considerably behind the performance of standard PPO. While applying the clipping strategy yields some improvements, its results are still considerably inferior on the tasks where Euclidean embeddings appear to already recover effective representations (e.g. starpilot). In part (A.2) we visualize the negated entropy of the different PPO agents. PPO's policy optimization objective includes both a reward maximization term, which requires an auxiliary estimator, and an entropy bonus term that can instead be differentiated exactly and optimized end-to-end. Its purpose

is to push PPO agents to explore if they struggle to optimize performance with the current data. We note that the Hyperbolic PPO agents take significantly longer to reach higher levels of entropy in the initial training phases and are also much slower to reduce their entropy as their performance improves. These results appear to indicate the presence of optimization challenges stemming from end-to-end RL training with hyperbolic representations. Therefore, we turn our attention to analyzing the gradients in our hyperbolic models. In part (B.1), we visualize the magnitude of the gradients both as backpropagated from the final representations and to the convolutional encoder. In part (B.2), we also visualize the variance of the same gradients with respect to the different input states in a minibatch. We find that hyperbolic PPO suffers from a severe exploding gradients problem, with both magnitudes and variances being several orders of magnitude larger than the Euclidean baseline. Similar instabilities have been documented by much recent literature, as described in App. B. Yet, in the RL case, common stabilization techniques such as careful initialization and clipping are visibly insufficient, resulting in ineffective learning and inferior agent performance.

# 3.3 STABILIZING HYPERBOLIC REPRESENTATIONS

We attribute the observed optimization challenges from our naive hyperbolic PPO implementation to the high variance and non-stationarity characterizing RL. Initialization and clipping have been designed for stationary ML applications with fixed dataset and targets. In these settings, regularizing the initial learning iterations enables the model to find appropriate angular layouts of the representations for the underlying fixed loss landscape. Without appropriate angular layouts, useful representations become very hard to recover due to the highly non-convex spectrum of hyperbolic neural networks, often resulting in failure modes with low performance (Ganea et al., 2018; López & Strube, 2020). We can intuitively see why this reliance is incompatible with the RL setting, where the trajectory data and loss landscape can change significantly throughout training, making early angular layouts inevitably suboptimal. This is further exacerbated by the high variance gradients already characterizing policy gradient optimization (Sutton & Barto, 2018; Wu et al., 2018) which facilitate entering unstable learning regimes that can lead to our observed failure modes.

Spectral norm. Another sub-field of ML dealing with non-stationarity and brittle optimization is generative modeling with adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014). In GAN training, the generated data and discriminator's parameters constantly evolve, making the loss landscape highly non-stationary as in the RL setting. Furthermore, the adversarial nature of the optimization makes it very brittle to exploding and vanishing gradients instabilities which lead to common failure modes (Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017; Brock et al., 2018). In this parallel literature, spectral normalization (SN) (Miyato et al., 2018) is a popular stabilization practice whose success made it ubiquitous in modern GAN implementations. Recent work (Lin et al., 2021) showed that a reason for its surprising effectiveness comes from regulating both the magnitude of the activations and their respective gradients very similarly to LeCun initialization (LeCun et al., 2012). Furthermore, when applied to the discriminator model, SN's effects appear to persist throughout training, while initialization strategies tend to only affect the initial iterations. In fact, they also show that ablating SN from GAN training empirically results in exploding gradients and degraded performance, closely resembling our same observed instabilities.

S-RYM. Inspired by these connections, we propose to counteract the optimization challenges in RL and hyperbolic representations with SN. We make two main changes from its usual application for GAN regularization. First, we apply SN only in the Euclidean encoder sub-network  $(f_{E})$ , leaving the final linear transformation in hyperbolic space  $(f_{H})$  unregularized since our instabilities appear to occur in the gradients from the hyperbolic representations. Furthermore, we add a scaling term to preserve stability for different latent representation sizes. In particular, modeling  $x_{E} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$  by an independent Gaussian, the magnitude of the representations follows some scaled Chi distribution  $\| x_{E} \| \sim \chi_{n}$ , which we can reasonably approximate with  $E[\| x_{E} \|] = E[\chi_{n}] \approx \sqrt{n}$ . Therefore, we propose to rescale the output of  $f_{E}$  by  $1 / \sqrt{n}$ , such that modifying the dimensionality of the representations should not significantly affect their magnitude before mapping them  $\mathbb{H}^n$ . We call this general stabilization recipe spectrally-regularized hyperbolic mappings (S-RYM).

Results. As shown in Figure 7, integrating S-RYM with our hyperbolic RL agents appears to resolve their optimization challenges and considerably improve the Euclidean baseline's performance (A). To validate that these performance benefits are due to the hyperbolic geometry of the latent space, we also compare with another Euclidean ablation making use of SN, which fails to attain any improvement. Furthermore, S-RYM maintains low gradient magnitudes (B), confirming its effectiveness to stabilize training. In App. E.1, we also show that SN and rescaling are both crucial for S-RYM. Thus, in the next section we evaluate our hyperbolic deep RL framework on a large-scale, analyzing its efficacy and behavior across different benchmarks, RL algorithms, and training conditions.

# 4 EXTENSIONS AND EVALUATION

To test the generality of our hyperbolic deep RL framework, in addition to the on-policy PPO we also integrate it with the off-policy Rainbow DQN algorithm (Hessel et al., 2018). Our implementations use the same parameters and models specified in prior traditional RL literature, without any additional tuning. Furthermore, in addition to the full Procgen benchmark (16 envs.) we also evaluate on

the popular Atari 100K benchmark (Bellemare et al., 2013; Kaiser et al., 2020) (26 envs.), repeating for 5 random seeds. We provide all details about benchmarks and implementations in App. C.

Generalization on Procgen. Given the documented representation efficiency of hyperbolic space, we evaluate our hyperbolic PPO implementation also reducing the dimensionality of the final representation to 32 (see App. E.2), with relative compute and parameter efficiency benefits. We compare our regularized hyperbolic PPO with using data augmentations, a more traditional way of encoding inductive biases from inducing invariances. We consider random crop augmentations from their popularity and success in modern RL. As shown in Table 1, our hyperbolic PPO implementation with S-RYM appears to yield conspicuous performance gains on most of the environments. At the same time, reducing the size of the representations provides even further benefits with significant improvements in 13/16 tasks. In contrast, applying data augmentations yields much lower and inconsistent gains, even hurting on some tasks where hyperbolic RL provides considerable improvements (e.g. bossfight). We also find that test performance gains do not always correlate with gains on the specific 200 training levels, yielding a significantly reduced generalization gap for the hyperbolic agents. We perform the same experiment but apply our hyperbolic deep RL framework to Rainbow DQN with similar results, also obtaining significant gains in 13/16 tasks, as reported in App. D.1.

We also evaluate the robustness of our PPO agents to encoding spurious features, only relevant for the training levels. In particular, we examine tasks where PPO tends to perform well and consider lowering the training levels from 200 to 100, 50, and 25. As shown in Figure 8, the performance of PPO visibly drops at each step halving the number of training levels, suggesting that the Euclidean representations overfit and lose their original efficacy. In contrast, hyperbolic PPO appears much more robust, still surpassing the original PPO results with only 100 training levels in fruitbot and 50 in starpilot. While also applying data augmentation attenuates the performance drops, its effects appear more limited and inconsistent, providing almost null improvements for starpilot.

Sample-efficiency on Atari 100K. We focus on the performance of our hyperbolic Rainbow DQN implementation, as the severe data limitations of this benchmark make PPO and other on-policy algorithms impractical. We show the absolute and relative per-environment performance changes from our hyperbolic RL framework in Figure 9, and provide

aggregate statistics in Table 2. Also on this benchmark, the exact same hyperbolic deep RL framework provides consistent and significant benefits. In particular, we record improvements on 22/26 Atari environments over the Euclidean baseline, almost doubling the final human normalized score.

Considerations and comparisons. Our results empirically validate that introducing hyperbolic representations to shape the prior of deep RL models is both remarkably general and effective. We record almost universal improvements on two fundamentally different RL algorithms, considering both generalizations to new levels from millions of frames (Procgen) and to new experiences from only 2hrs of total play time (Atari 100K). Furthermore, our hyperbolic RL agents outperform the scores reported in most other recent advances, coming very close to the current SotA algorithms which incorporate different expensive and domain-specialized auxiliary practices (see App. D.2-D.3). Our approach is also orthogonal to many of these advances and appears to provide compatible and complementary benefits (see App. E.3). Taken together, we believe these factors show the great potential of our hyperbolic framework to become a standard way of parameterizing deep RL models.

Figure 10: Visualization of 2-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings in the bigfish environment as we progress through a trajectory, encoding states from either policy transitions or random transitions (details in App. D.4).

Representations interpretation. We train our hyperbolic PPO agent with only 2-dimensional representations, which still remarkably provide concrete generalization benefits over Euclidean PPO (App. D.4). Then, we analyze how these representations evolve within trajectories, mapping them on the Poincaré disk and visualizing the corresponding states. We observe a recurring cyclical behavior, where the magnitude of the representations monotonically increases within subsets of the trajectory as more obstacles/enemies appear. We show this in Fig. 10 and Fig. 12, comparing the representations of on-policy states sampled at constant intervals with trajectory deviations from executing random behavior. We observe the representations form tree-like structures, with the magnitudes in the on-policy states growing in the direction of the Value function's gyroplane's normal. This intuitively reflects that as new elements appear the agent recognizes a larger opportunity for rewards, yet, requiring a finer level of control as distances to the policy gyroplanes will also grow exponentially, reducing entropy. Instead, following random deviations, magnitudes grow in directions orthogonal to the Value gyroplane's normal. This still reflects the higher precision required for optimal decision-making, but also the higher uncertainty to obtain future rewards from worse states.

# 5 RELATED WORK

Generalization is a key open problem in RL (Kirk et al., 2021). End-to-end training of deep models with RL objectives appears has been shown prone to overfitting from spurious features only relevant in the observed transitions (Song et al., 2019; Bertran et al., 2020). To address this, prior work considered different data augmentation strategies (Laskin et al., 2020b; Yarats et al., 2021a; Cobbe et al., 2019), and online adaption methods on top to alleviate engineering burdens (Zhang & Guo, 2021; Raileanu et al., 2020). Alternative approaches have been considering problem-specific properties of the environment (Zhang et al., 2020; Raileanu & Fergus, 2021), auxiliary losses (Laskin et al., 2020a; Schwarzer et al., 2020), and frozen pre-trained layers (Yarats et al., 2021b; Stooke et al., 2021). Instead, we propose to encode a new inductive bias making use of the geometric properties of hyperbolic space, something orthogonal and likely compatible with most such prior methods.

While hyperbolic representations found recent popularity in machine learning, there have not been notable extensions for deep RL (Peng et al., 2021). Most relatedly, Tiwari & Prannoy (2018) proposed to produce hyperbolic embeddings of the state space of tabular MDPs to recover options (Sutton et al., 1999). Yet, they did not use RL for learning, but fixed data and a supervised loss based on the co-occurrence of states, similarly to the original method by Nickel & Kiela (2017).

# 6 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this work, we introduce hyperbolic geometry to deep RL. We analyze training agents using latent hyperbolic representations and propose spectrally-regularized hyperbolic mappings, a new stabilization strategy that overcomes the observed optimization instabilities. Hence, we apply our framework to obtain hyperbolic versions of established on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms, which we show substantially outperform their Euclidean counterparts in two popular benchmarks. We provide numerous results validating that hyperbolic representations provide deep models with a more suitable prior for control, with considerable benefits for generalization and sample-efficiency. We share our implementation to facilitate future RL advances considering hyperbolic space as a new, general tool.

# ETHICS STATEMENT

We proposed to provide deep RL models with a more suitable prior for learning policies, using hyperbolic geometry. In terms of carbon footprint, our implementation does not introduce additional compute costs for training, and even appears to perform best with more compact representation sizes. Consequently, given the nature of our contribution, its ethical implications are bound to the implications of advancing the RL field. In this regard, as autonomous agents become more applicable, poor regulation and misuse may cause harm. Yet, we believe these concerns are currently out-weighted by the field's significant positive potential to advance human flourishing.

# REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

We provide detailed descriptions of our integration of hyperbolic space, experimental setups, and network architectures in Section 3 and also Appendix B. We provide all details, including a full list of hyper-parameters, in Appendix C. We currently shared an anonymized version of our code to reproduce the main experiments in the supplementary material. We will open-source our full documented implementations after review to facilitate future extensions.
