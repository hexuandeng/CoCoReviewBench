# Abstract

Despite strong performance in numerous applications, the vulnerability of deep learning to input perturbations has raised serious questions about its use in critical domains. While adversarial training has been successful at mitigating this issue in practice, state-of-the-art methods are increasingly application-dependent, heuristic in nature, and suffer from fundamental trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness. Moreover, the problem of finding worst-case perturbations is nonconvex and severely underparameterized, both of which engender a non-favorable optimization landscape. In this way, there is a gap between the theory and practice of robust learning, particularly with respect to when and why adversarial training works. In this paper, we take a constrained learning approach to address these questions and provide a theoretical foundation for robust learning. In particular, we leverage semi-infinite optimization and non-convex duality theory to show that adversarial training is equivalent to a statistical problem over perturbation distributions, which we fully characterize under mild conditions. Notably, we show that a myriad of previous robust training techniques can be recovered for particular, sub-optimal choices of these distributions. Using these insights, we then propose a hybrid Langevin Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, of which several common algorithms (e.g., PGD) are special cases. Finally, we also use our framework to limit the nominal performance degradation with generalization guarantees, yielding comparable and, in some cases, improved results over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

# 1 Introduction

Learning is at the core of many modern information systems, with wide-ranging applications in clinical research [1-4], smart grids [5-7], and robotics [8-10]. However, it has become clear that learning-based solutions suffer from a critical lack of robustness [11-17], leading to models that are vulnerable to malicious tampering and unsafe behavior [18-22]. While robustness has been studied in statistics for decades [23-25], this issue has been exacerbated by the opacity, scale, and non-convexity of modern learning models, such as convolutional neural network (CNNs), making their behavior difficult to analyze. Thus, designing models which are robust to malicious attacks, such as imperceptible perturbations, has become a critical challenge in machine learning (ML).

The pernicious nature of these vulnerabilities has led to rapidly-growing interest in improving the so-called adversarial robustness of modern ML models. To this end, numerous approaches have been proposed based on tools from fields such as distributionally robust optimization [26-28] and statistical smoothing [29-31]. Yet a great deal of empirical evidence has shown that adversarial training is the most effective way to obtain robust classifiers, wherein models are trained on perturbed samples rather than directly on clean data [32-37]. And while this approach is now ubiquitous in practice, adversarial training faces two fundamental challenges.

Firstly, it is well-known that obtaining worst-case, adversarial perturbations of data is challenging in the context of deep neural networks (DNNs) [38, 39]. While gradient-based methods have been shown to be empirically effective at finding perturbations that lead to misclassification, there are no guarantees that these perturbations are truly worst-case due to the non-convexity of most commonly-used ML function classes [40]. Moreover, whereas optimizing the parameters of a CNNs is typically an overparameterized problem, finding worst-case perturbations is severely underparametrized and therefore does not enjoy the benign optimization landscape of standard training [41-45]. For this reason, state-of-the-art adversarial attacks increasingly rely on heuristics such as random initializations, multiple restarts, pruning, and other ad hoc training procedures [46-55].  
The second challenge faced by adversarial training is that it engenders a fundamental trade-off between robustness and nominal performance [56-58]. In practice, penalty-based methods that incorporate clean data into the training objective are often used to overcome this issue [59-62]. However, while empirically successful, these methods cannot typically guarantee nominal or adversarial performance outside of the training samples. Indeed, classical learning theory [63, 64] provides generalization bounds only for the aggregated objective and not each individual penalty term. Additionally, the choice of the penalty parameter is not straightforward and depends on the underlying learning task, making it difficult to transfer across applications and highly dependent on domain expert knowledge.  
Contributions. To summarize, there is a significant gap between the theory and practice of robust learning, particularly with respect to when and why adversarial training works. In this paper, we study the algorithmic foundations of robust learning toward understanding the fundamental limits of adversarial training. To do so, we leverage semi-infinite constrained learning theory, providing a theoretical foundation for gradient-based attacks and mitigating the issue of nominal performance degradation. In particular, our contributions are as follows:  
- We show that adversarial training is equivalent to a stochastic optimization problem over a specific, non-atomic distribution, which we characterize using recent non-convex duality results [65, 66]. Further, we show that a myriad of previous adversarial attacks reduce to particular, sub-optimal choices of this distribution.  
- We propose an algorithm to solve this problem based on stochastic optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Gradient-based adversarial methods such as [33, 32] can be interpreted as limiting cases of this procedure.  
- We show that our algorithm performs similarly, and in some cases outperforms, state-of-the-art baselines on standard benchmarks, including MNIST and CIFAR.  
- We provide generalization guarantees for the empirical version of this algorithm based on dual learning theory [66], showing how to effectively limit the nominal performance degradation of robust classifiers.

# 2 Problem formulation

Standard training. Consider the statistical problem of learning a classifier that minimizes an expected loss according to an unknown data distribution. Explicitly, let  $\mathcal{D}$  denote an unknown joint probability distribution over instance-label pairs  $(\mathbf{x},y)$ , where  $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$  is supported on a compact subset of  $\mathbb{R}^d$ , and  $y \in \mathcal{Y} = \{1,\dots,K\}$  denotes the class of  $\mathbf{x}$ . For example, in a handwritten digit image-classification tasks, the label  $y$  would correspond to the number depicted in the image  $\mathbf{x}$ . For the sake of exposition, assume that  $\mathcal{D}$  admits a density  $\mathfrak{p}(\mathbf{x},y)$ . Throughout this paper, we consider the measurable space  $(\Omega ,\mathcal{B})$ , with  $\Omega = \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$  and  $\mathcal{B}$  denoting its Borel  $\sigma$ -algebra.

Consider the hypothesis class  $\mathcal{H}$  containing functions  $f_{\theta}:\mathbb{R}^{d}\to \mathcal{P}^{K}$  parametrized by  $\pmb {\theta}\in \Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^p$  where again  $\Theta$  is assumed to be compact, and where  $\mathcal{P}^K$  is the  $(K - 1)$ -simplex. We assume that  $f_{\theta}$  is differentiable with respect to  $\pmb{\theta}$ . Note that the classes of halfspaces, logistic classifiers, and CNNs with softmax outputs can all be described by this formalism. To make a prediction  $\hat{y}\in \mathcal{V}$ , we assume that the simplex  $\mathcal{P}^K$  is mapped to the set of classes  $\mathcal{V}$  via

$$
\hat {y} \in \operatorname {a r g m a x} _ {k \in \mathcal {Y}} [ f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x}) ] _ {k} \tag {1}
$$

with ties broken arbitrarily. In this way, we can think of the  $k$ -th output of the classifier as representing the probability of  $y = k$ . This learning problem can then be formulated as the mathematical program

$$
\underset {\boldsymbol {\theta} \in \Theta} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \mathbb {E} _ {(\mathbf {x}, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x}), y\right) \right], \tag {P-NOM}
$$

where  $\ell$  is a  $[0,B]$ -valued loss function such that  $\ell (\cdot ,y)$  is  $M$ -Lipschitz continuous function for all  $y\in \mathcal{V}$ . Observe that  $(\mathbf{x},y)\mapsto \ell \big(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}),y\big)$  must be integrable for (P-NOM) to be well-defined; we further assume that this map is an element of the functional  $L^p$  space for some fixed  $p\in (1,\infty)$ .

Adversarial training. For common choices of the hypothesis class  $\mathcal{H}$ , including DNNs, the classifier obtained from (P-NOM) is known to be sensitive to input perturbations [67]. In other words, it is often straightforward to find a relatively small perturbations  $\delta$  such that the classifier correctly predicts the label  $y$  of  $\mathbf{x}$ , but misclassifies the perturbed sample  $\mathbf{x} + \delta$ . This has lead to increased interest in the robust analog of (P-NOM), namely,

$$
P _ {\mathrm {R}} ^ {\star} \triangleq \min  _ {\boldsymbol {\theta} \in \Theta} \mathbb {E} _ {(\mathbf {x}, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \max  _ {\boldsymbol {\delta} \in \Delta} \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}), y\right) \right], \tag {P-RO}
$$

where  $\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^d$  denotes the set of valid perturbations<sup>1</sup>. Typically,  $\Delta$  is chosen to be a ball with respect to a given metric on Euclidean space, e.g.  $\Delta = \Delta(\epsilon) = \{\delta \in \mathbb{R}^d : \| \delta \| \leq \epsilon\}$ . Here, however, we make no particular assumption on the specific form of  $\Delta$ . In particular, our contributions apply to arbitrary perturbation models, such as those used in [68-72].

Analyzing conditions under which (P-RO) can be (probably approximately) solved from data, e.g., using empirical risk minimization (ERM), remains an active area of research. While bounds on the Rademacher complexity [73, 74] and VC dimension [73-77] of the robust loss

$$
\bar {\ell} \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x}), y\right) = \max  _ {\boldsymbol {\delta} \in \Delta} \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}), y\right) \tag {2}
$$

have been derived for an array of losses and hypothesis classes, there are still open questions on the effectiveness and sample complexity of adversarial learning [74].

While these works justify replacing the objective of (P-RO) by its empirical counterpart, they do not address the issue of computing the adversarial loss (2). Indeed, due to the non-concavity of the map  $\delta \mapsto \ell(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x} + \delta), y)$  (except in trivial cases, e.g., when  $\mathcal{H}$  and  $\ell$  are linear), evaluating the maximum in (2) is not straightforward. For this reason, a variety of heuristics are generally used to approximate (2), such as linearizing the objective [78], drawing  $\delta$  randomly from a hand-crafted distribution [79], or choosing perturbations so as to modify perceptual properties of the input  $\mathbf{x}$  [80-82]. However, the most common and empirically effective strategy has been to leverage the differentiability of typical ML models (e.g., CNNs) with respect to their inputs and approximate the value of (2) using projected gradient ascent. In [33, 83], for instance,  $\delta$  is computed from  $(\theta, \mathbf{x}, y)$  by repeatedly applying

$$
\boldsymbol {\delta} ^ {+} = \prod_ {\Delta} \left[ \boldsymbol {\delta} + \eta \operatorname {s i g n} \left[ \nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\delta}} \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}), y\right) \right] \right], \tag {3}
$$

where  $\Pi_{\Delta}$  denotes the projection onto  $\Delta$  and  $\eta > 0$  is a fixed step size.

Common pitfalls for adversarial training. Their empirical success notwithstanding, gradient-based approaches to adversarial training are not without issues. One fundamental pitfall is the fact that gradient-based algorithms are not guaranteed to provide optimal (or even near-optimal) perturbations, since  $\ell(f_{\theta}(\cdot), y)$  is typically not a convex function. In fact, notice that maximizing over  $\delta$  in (P-RO) is a severely underparametrized problem as opposed to the minimization over  $\theta$  and therefore does not enjoy the same benign optimization landscape [41-45]. In fact, heuristics such as random initializations [79] and step size adjustment [84] are often needed to improve the solutions obtained by (3). These issues are particularly critical given that models are also evaluated using some variant of (3). Thus, the use of heuristics generally undermines confidence with respect to the test-time robustness when training-time attacks do not match test-time attacks.

Another issue faced by the robust formulation (P-RO) is that it often degrades the nominal performance, i.e. the performance of the model on clean data. Penalty-based approaches are often used to overcome this issues by combining the objective of (P-NOM) with a penalty that promotes output invariance in a neighborhood of each sample [59]. In particular, this technique has been used to obtain state-of-the-art performance in several benchmarks [85]. These results, however, are not guaranteed to generalize outside of the training sample. Indeed, classical learning theory guarantees

generalization in terms of the aggregated objective and not in terms of the robustness requirements it may describe [63, 64, 66].

In the remainder of this paper, we address these two generalization issues by leveraging semi-infinite constrained learning theory. To do so, we explicitly formulate the problem of finding the most robust classifier among those that have good nominal performance. We then show that (P-RO) is equivalent to a stochastic optimization problem (Section 3.1) that can be related to many robust training methods proposed in the literature. We then leverage recent dual empirical learning results [66] to provide generalization guarantees that allow constrained robust learning problems to be solved using empirical (unconstrained) risk minimization (Section 3.2). Finally, we derive an algorithm based on a Langevin MCMC sampler of which (3) is a particular case (Section 4).

# 3 Dual robust learning

In this section, we develop the theoretical foundation to tackle the two challenges of (P-RO), namely, finding worst-case perturbations, i.e. evaluating (2), and mitigating the degradation of the nominal performance. To do so, we will rely on constrained learning and duality theory. Explicitly, we set out to tackle the following constrained learning problem

$$
P ^ {\star} \triangleq \underset {\theta \in \Theta} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \quad \mathbb {E} _ {(\mathbf {x}, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \max  _ {\delta \in \Delta} \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}), y\right) \right] \tag {PI}
$$

$$
\text {s u b j e c t} \quad \mathbb {E} _ {(\mathbf {x}, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} [ \ell (f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x}), y) ] \leq \rho
$$

where  $\rho \geq 0$  is the fixed desired nominal performance level. At a high level, in Problem (PI) we seek the most robust classifier among those that have good nominal performance. In this way, Problem PI is directly designed to address the well-known trade-off between robustness and accuracy.

At face value, the statistical constraint in Problem PI is challenging to enforce in practice, especially given the well-known difficult in solving the unconstrained analog of (P-RO) in practice. To this end, our approach in this work is to use duality to obtain solutions for (PI) that generalize with respect to both adversarial and nominal performance (see Section 3.2). Before describing this approach, we emphasize that while we consider the nominal loss as a constraint, the theory and algorithms that follow also apply to the constrained learning problem in which the objective and constraint of (PI) are reversed.

# 3.1 Computing worst-case perturbations

Before tackling the constrained problem (PI), let us begin by solving its unconstrained version, namely, (P-RO). To do so, we start by writing (P-RO) using an epigraph formulation of the maximum function to obtain the semi-infinite program

$$
P _ {\mathrm {R}} ^ {\star} = \underset {\theta \in \Theta , t \in L ^ {p}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \quad \mathbb {E} _ {(\mathbf {x}, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} [ t (\mathbf {x}, y) ] \tag {PII}
$$

$$
\text {s u b j e c t} \quad \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}), y\right) \leq t (\mathbf {x}, y), \quad \text {f o r a l l} (\mathbf {x}, \boldsymbol {\delta}, y) \in \mathcal {X} \times \Delta \times \mathcal {Y}.
$$

Note that (PII) is indeed equivalent to (P-RO) given that

$$
\max  _ {\delta \in \Delta} \ell \left(f _ {\theta} (\mathbf {x} + \delta), y\right) \leq t (\mathbf {x}, y) \iff \ell \left(f _ {\theta} (\mathbf {x} + \delta), y\right) \leq t (\mathbf {x}, y) \forall \delta \in \Delta \tag {4}
$$

While at first it may seem that we have made Problem PI more challenging to solve by transforming an unconstrained problem into an infinitely-constrained problem, notice that (PII) is no longer a composite min-max problem. Additionally, it is linear in  $t$ , indicating that Problem PII should be amenable to a Lagrangian duality based approach. Indeed, the following proposition shows that (PII) can be used to obtain a statistical counterpart of (P-RO).

Proposition 3.1. If  $(\mathbf{x},y)\mapsto \ell \big(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}),y\big)\in L^{p}$  for  $p\in (1,\infty)$ , then (P-RO) can be written as

$$
P _ {\mathrm {R}} ^ {\star} = \min  _ {\boldsymbol {\theta} \in \Theta} p (\boldsymbol {\theta}), \tag {PIII}
$$

for the primal function

$$
p (\boldsymbol {\theta}) \triangleq \max  _ {\lambda \in \mathcal {P} ^ {q}} \mathbb {E} _ {(\mathbf {x}, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {\delta \sim \lambda (\delta | \mathbf {x}, y)} \left[ \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} + \delta), y\right) \right] \right], \tag {5}
$$

where  $\mathcal{P}^q$ , with  $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$ , is the subspace of  $L^q$  containing almost everywhere non-negative functions such that  $\mathfrak{p}(\mathbf{x}, y) = 0 \Rightarrow \lambda(\delta \mid \mathbf{x}, y) = 0$  and  $\int \lambda(\delta \mid \mathbf{x}, y) d\delta = 1$  for almost every  $(\mathbf{x}, y) \in \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$ .

![](images/12fa99ca267f03639b5464a3cb28eca611bfe79383d8737905ab6e747876e27d.jpg)

Proposition 3.1 establishes an equivalence between the traditional robust learning problem (P-RO), where the maximum is taken over perturbations  $\delta \in \Delta$  of the input, and its stochastic version (PIII), where the maximum is taken over a conditional distribution of perturbations  $\delta \sim \lambda(\delta | \mathbf{x}, y)$ . This dichotomy parallels the one that arises in PAC vs. agnostic PAC learning. Indeed, while the former seeks a deterministic map  $(\theta, \mathbf{x}, y) \mapsto \delta$ , the latter considers instead a distribution of perturbations over  $\delta | \mathbf{x}, y$  parametrized by  $\theta$ . In fact, since (PIII) is obtained from (P-RO) through semi-infinite duality (see proof of Proposition 3.1), the density of this distribution is exactly characterized by the dual variables  $\lambda$ . Several adversarial training methods can be interpreted by taking particular, sub-optimal choices of this distribution (see Appendix A).

It is also worth noting that while (PIII) was obtained using Lagrangian duality, it can also be seen as a linear lifting of the maximization in (2). From this perspective, while recovering (2) would require  $\lambda$  to be atomic, Proposition 3.1 shows that this is in fact not necessary as long as  $\ell(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}), y)$  is an element of  $L^p$ . Furthermore, observe that Proposition 3.1 does not account for  $p \in \{1, \infty\}$  for conciseness only, since their dual spaces are not isomorphic to  $L^q$  for any  $q$ . Still, neither of the dual spaces  $L^{1^*}$  or  $L^{\infty^*}$  contain Dirac distributions, meaning that  $\lambda$  would remain non-atomic.

Exact solutions for the outer maximization in Problem (PIII). While (PIII) provides a new, infinitely-constrained alternative formulation for (P-RO), the fact remains that the objectives of both (PIII) and (P-RO) involve the solution of a non-trivial maximization. However, whereas the maximization problem in (P-RO) is a (possibly non-convex) finite dimensional optimization problem, the maximization in (PIII) is a linear, variational problem. We can therefore leverage variational duality theory to obtain a full characterization of the optimal distribution  $\lambda^{\star}$  when  $p = 2$ .

Proposition 3.2 (Optimal distribution for (PIII)). Let  $p = 2$  (and  $q = 2$ ) in Proposition 3.1. For each  $(\mathbf{x},y) \in \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$ , there exists  $\gamma(\mathbf{x},y) > 0$  and  $\mu(\mathbf{x},y) \in \mathbb{R}$  such that

$$
\lambda^ {\star} (\boldsymbol {\delta} \mid \mathbf {x}, y) = \left[ \frac {\ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}) , y\right) - \mu (\mathbf {x} , y)}{\gamma (\mathbf {x} , y)} \right] _ {+}, \tag {6}
$$

with  $[z]_{+} = \max (0,z)$ , is a solution of the maximization in (5). The value of  $\mu (\mathbf{x},y)$  is such that

$$
\int \left[ \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}), y\right) - \mu (\mathbf {x}, y) \right] _ {+} d \boldsymbol {\delta} = \gamma (\mathbf {x}, y), f o r a l l (\mathbf {x}, y) \in \mathcal {X} \times \mathcal {Y}.
$$

Proof. See supplementary material (Appendix C).

Hence, in the particular case of  $(\mathbf{x},y)\mapsto \ell \big(f_{\pmb{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}),y\big)\in L^{2}$ , we can obtain a closed-form expression for the distribution that maximizes the objective of (PIII), which turns out to be essentially proportional to a truncated version of the loss of the classifier. Note that the assumption that the loss belongs to  $\in L^2$  is mild given that the compactness of  $\mathcal{X}$ ,  $\mathcal{V}$ , and  $\Delta$  imply that  $L^{p_1}\subset L^{p_2}$  for  $p_1 > p_2$ . It is, however, fundamental to obtain the closed-form solution in Proposition 3.2 since it allows (5) to be formulated as a strongly convex constrained problem whose primal solution (6) can be recovered from its dual variables (namely,  $\gamma$  and  $\mu$ ).

For completeness, we remark that in practice, the value of  $\gamma$  for which (6) is a solution of (5) is not known a priori and can be arbitrarily close to zero, in which case the support of  $\lambda^{\star}$  vanishes. Since sampling from these discontinuous distributions can be quite intricate in high dimensional settings, we fix  $\gamma (\mathbf{x},y) = \int \ell (f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x} + \delta),y)d\delta$  in the sequel. Since  $\ell$  is non-negative, this implies that  $\mu (\mathbf{x},y) = 0$  and that the distribution induced by  $\lambda^{\star}$  is exactly proportional to the loss. In Section 4, we put forward an MCMC algorithm that samples from this distribution. While this is naturally an approximation that may over-smooth the optimal distribution, it is one that is quite effective in practice (see Section 6). What is more, it allows us to derive generalization guarantees for dual solutions of the constrained learning problem (PI).

# 3.2 Solving the constrained learning problem

While we have shown that (PI) exactly formulates the problem of finding the most robust model with high nominal performance, the statistical and possibly non-convex nature of the constraint makes

it difficult to impose directly (e.g. by projecting onto the feasibility set). Moreover, recall that we have access to the data distribution  $\mathcal{D}$  only through samples  $(\mathbf{x},y)\sim \mathcal{D}$ , which means that we in practice we cannot evaluate the expectations in (PI). To overcome these obstacles, we use duality to approximate (PI) by the empirical, unconstrained saddle point problem

$$
\hat {D} ^ {\star} \triangleq \max  _ {\nu \geq 0} \min  _ {\boldsymbol {\theta} \in \Theta} \hat {L} (\boldsymbol {\theta}, \nu) \quad (\widehat {\mathrm {D I}})
$$

where  $\hat{L} (\pmb {\theta},\nu)$  defines the empirical Lagrangian:

$$
\hat {L} (\boldsymbol {\theta}, \nu) = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {n} \left[ \max  _ {\boldsymbol {\delta} \in \Delta} \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {n} + \boldsymbol {\delta}\right), y _ {n}\right) + \nu \left[ \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {n}\right), y _ {n}\right) - \rho \right] \right]. \tag {7}
$$

The following proposition shows that solutions of  $(\widehat{\mathrm{DI}})$  are (probably approximately) near-optimal and feasible for (PI). Naturally, this is only possible if the objective and constraint of (PI) are learnable individually. As we discussed in Section 2, this is known to hold in a variety of scenarios (when the Rademacher complexity or VC dimension are bounded), but remains an area of active research [73-77]. This learnability condition is encapsulated in the following assumptions:

Assumption 3.3. The parametrization  $f_{\theta}$  is rich enough so that for each  $\pmb{\theta}_1, \pmb{\theta}_2 \in \Theta$  and  $\beta \in [0,1]$ , there exists  $\pmb{\theta} \in \Theta$  such that

$$
\sup  _ {\mathbf {x} \in \mathcal {X}} | \beta f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {1}} (\boldsymbol {x}) + (1 - \beta) f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta} _ {2}} (\boldsymbol {x}) - f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\boldsymbol {x}) | \leq \alpha . \tag {8}
$$

Assumption 3.4. There exists  $\pmb{\theta}^{\prime}\in \Theta$  such that  $\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}}\left[\ell \big(f_{\pmb{\theta}^{\prime}}(\mathbf{x}),y\big)\right] < \rho -M\alpha .$

Assumption 3.5. There exists  $\zeta_R(N),\zeta_N(N)\geq 0$  monotonically decreasing with  $N$  such that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left| \mathbb {E} _ {(\boldsymbol {x}, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \max  _ {\boldsymbol {\delta} \in \Delta} \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\boldsymbol {x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}), y\right) \right] - \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \max  _ {\boldsymbol {\delta} \in \Delta} \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\boldsymbol {x} _ {n} + \boldsymbol {\delta}\right), y _ {n}\right) \right| \leq \zeta_ {R} (N) w. p. 1 - \delta \tag {9a} \\ \left| \mathbb {E} _ {(\boldsymbol {x}, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x}), y\right) \right] - \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {n}\right), y _ {n}\right) \right| \leq \zeta_ {N} (N) w. p. 1 - \delta (9 b) \\ \end{array}
$$

for all  $\pmb {\theta}\in \Theta$

Under these assumptions, we can explicitly bound the empirical duality gap between gap (with high probability) and characterize the feasibility of the empirical dual optimal solution for (PI).

Proposition 3.6 (The empirical dual of (PI)). Let  $\ell(\cdot, y)$  be a convex function for all  $y \in \mathcal{V}$ . Under Assumptions 3.3-3.5, it holds with probability  $1 - 6\delta$  that

1.  $\left| P^{\star} - \hat{D}^{\star} \right| \leq M\alpha + (1 + \overline{\nu}) \max(\zeta_R(N), \zeta_N(N));$  and  
2. there exists  $\pmb{\theta}^{\dagger}\in \operatorname *{argmin}_{\pmb {\theta}\in \Theta}\hat{L} (\pmb {\theta},\hat{\nu}^{\star})$  such that  $\mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim \mathcal{D}}\left[\ell \big(f_{\pmb{\theta}^{\dagger}}(\mathbf{x}),y\big)\right]\leq \rho +\zeta_N(N).$

Here,  $\hat{\nu}^{\star}$  denotes a solution of (DI),  $\nu^{\star}$  denotes an optimal dual variable of (PI) solved over  $\overline{\mathcal{H}} = \mathrm{conv}(\mathcal{H})$  instead of  $\mathcal{H}$ , and  $\overline{\nu} = \max (\hat{\nu}^{\star},\nu^{\star})$ . Additionally, for any interpolating classifier  $\theta^\prime$ , i.e. such that  $\mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim \mathcal{D}}\left[\ell \big(f_{\theta '}(\mathbf{x}),y\big)\right] = 0$ , it holds that

$$
\nu^ {\star} \leq \rho^ {- 1} \mathbb {E} _ {(\mathbf {x}, y) \sim \mathcal {D}} \left[ \max  _ {\delta \in \Delta} \ell \left(f _ {\theta^ {\prime}} (\mathbf {x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}), y\right) \right]. \tag {10}
$$

Proof. See supplementary material (Appendix D).

Proposition 3.6 states that seeking a robust classifier with a given nominal performance is (probably approximately) equivalent to seeking a classifier that minimizes a combination of the nominal and adversarial empirical loss. Yet, while (7) resembles a penalty-based formulation such as the one in the well-known TRADES algorithm [59], notice that  $\nu$  is an optimization variable in  $(\widehat{\mathrm{DI}})$  rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Though seemingly innocuous, this is the difference between guaranteeing generalization only on the aggregated loss (7) and guaranteeing generalization for the objective value

and feasibility as in Proposition 3.6. Additionally, notice that [59] seeks an invariant classifier, i.e. a classifier for which  $f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\delta})$  and  $f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})$  are similar, rather than one with small adversarial loss. This problem can also be accounted for in (PI) by replacing the loss in the objective by a measure of average causal effect (ACE).

Combining Propositions 3.1-3.6, we obtain an optimization problem that is considerably more amenable than (PI). Indeed, it is (i) empirical and does not involve unknown statistical quantities such as  $\mathcal{D}$ ; (ii) unconstrained; and (iii) its objective does not involve a hard maximization problem in view of the closed-form characterization of  $\lambda^{\star}$  in Proposition 3.2. In the next section, we leverage these properties to propose a practical algorithms based on MCMC and stochastic optimization.

# 4 Dual robust learning algorithm

As shown in the previous section, Propositions 3.1-3.6 allows us to transform (PI) into the following Dual Adversarial LEarning problem

$$
\hat {D} ^ {\star} \triangleq \max  _ {\nu \geq 0} \min  _ {\theta \in \Theta} \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {n} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {\delta_ {n}} \left[ \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {n} + \boldsymbol {\delta} _ {n}\right), y _ {n}\right) \right] + \nu \left[ \ell \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {n}\right), y _ {n}\right) - \rho \right] \right] \quad (\text {P - D A L E})
$$

where  $\delta_{n} \sim \gamma^{-1}\left[\ell(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{n} + \delta_{n}), y_{n}) - \mu\right]_{+}$  for some  $\gamma > 0$  and  $\mu$  as in Proposition 3.2. Unlike (PI), (P-DALE) is an unconstrained optimization problem whose cost function no longer requires a maximization over the perturbations  $\delta$ . In fact, for models that are linear in  $\theta$  but nonlinear in the input (e.g., kernel models or logistic regression), this implies that we have transformed the non-convex, composite optimization problem (PI) into the convex (P-DALE). Naturally, for many modern ML models, such as CNNs, (P-DALE) remains a non-convex program in  $\theta$ . However, there is overwhelming theoretical and empirical evidence that gradient descent algorithm yield good local minimizers for such overparametrized problems [41-45].

That being said, solving (P-DALE) remains a highly nontrivial challenge. In particular, although written in empirical form over the samples  $\{(x_{n},y_{n})\}$ , (P-DALE) remains a stochastic optimization problem. Still, since we know the distribution of  $\delta_{n}$ , we can leverage stochastic approximation methods to minimize its objective using samples from this perturbation distribution. However, obtaining such samples can be challenging, especially when the dimension of  $\delta_{n}$  is large (e.g. for image-classification tasks) and the distribution is discontinuous (Proposition 3.2). This issue can be addressed using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, which leverage the geometry of the distribution to overcome the curse of dimensionality. In particular, we propose to use a projected Langevin sampler (LMC) [86] and fix  $\gamma = \int \ell (f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol {\delta}),y)d\mathbf{x}d\boldsymbol{y}$  so that  $\mu = 0$  and the distribution of  $\delta_{n}$  is exactly proportional to the loss. We leave for future work the exploration of more advanced HMC methods capable of faster mixing (e.g., proximal Langevin [86] or hit-and-run [87]) and sampling from more complex, discontinuous distributions (e.g. [88]). The resulting algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1.

Notice that Algorithm 1 accounts for scenarios in which the losses associated with the adversarial performance  $(\bar{\ell})$ , the perturbation  $(g)$ , and the nominal performance  $(\ell)$  are different. It can therefore learn from perturbations that are adversarial for a different loss than the one used for training the model  $\theta$ . This generality allows it to tackle different applications by, e.g., replacing the adversarial error objective in (PI) by a measure of model invariance (e.g. ACE in [59]). It will also be used to show how existing adversarial training procedures can be seen as approximations of Algorithm 1 (see Appendix A).

Before proceeding, we provide a few notes on the convergence properties of Algorithm 1. To begin, observe that it Algorithm 1 is primal-dual algorithm [89] in which the sampling procedure in steps 3-7 is used to obtain an estimate of the stochastic gradient of the primal problem. When  $\pmb{\theta} \mapsto \ell(f_{\pmb{\theta}}(\cdot), \cdot)$  is convex (e.g., for linear, kernel, or logistic models), it is well-known that SGD converges almost surely as long as this gradient estimate is unbiased [90]. As is typical with LMC, we omitted the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance step in Algorithm 1 that would guarantee unbiased estimates [91]. Still, when  $g$  is log-concave (e.g., the softmax output of a CNN), this procedure approaches the true distribution in total variation norm, which implies that its bias can be made arbitrarily small [86]. This is enough to guarantee almost sure convergence to a neighborhood of the optimum [92, 93].

1: repeat   
2: for Batch  $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i = 1}^m$  do   
3:  $\delta_{i}\gets 0$  , for  $i = 1,\dots ,m$    
4: for  $L$  steps do   
5:  $U_{i}\gets T^{-1}\log \left[g\big(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{i} + \delta_{i}),y_{i}\big)\right]$  , for  $i = 1,\ldots ,m$    
6:  $\delta_{i}\gets \prod_{\Delta}\left[\delta_{i} + \eta \nabla_{\delta_{i}}U_{i} + \sqrt{2\eta}\xi_{i}\right]$  , where  $\pmb {\xi}_i\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},I)$  and  $i = 1,\dots ,m$    
7: end for   
8:  $\theta \gets \theta -\frac{\eta_p}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\nabla_{\theta}\left[\tilde{\ell}\big(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{i} + \delta_{i}),y_{i}\big) + \nu \ell \big(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{i}),y_{i}\big)\right]$    
9: end for   
10:  $\nu \gets \left[\nu +\eta_d\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{n}\ell (f_\theta (\mathbf{x}_n),y_n) - \rho\right)\right]_+$    
11: until convergence

The convergence properties of primal-dual methods are less well understood when  $\theta \mapsto \ell(f_{\theta}(\cdot), \cdot)$  is non-convex. Still, a good estimate of the primal minimizer is enough to obtain an approximate gradient for dual ascent [65, 66]. There is overwhelming empirical and theoretical evidence that this is the case for overparametrized models, such as CNNs, trained using gradient descent [41-45]. We can then run the primal (step 8) and dual (step 10) updates at different timescales so as to obtain a good estimate of the primal minimizer before performing dual ascent.

# 5 Related work

Adversarial robustness. As described in Section 1, it is well-known that state-of-the-art classifiers are susceptible to adversarial attacks [11-17, 32]. Toward addressing this challenging, a rapidly-growing body of work has provided attack algorithms to generate data perturbations that fool classifiers and defense algorithms which are designed to train robust classifiers to be robust against these perturbations. However, despite the myriad of work in this field and significant improvements on a number of well-known benchmarks [26-31, 33-37], there are still many open questions on when adversarial learning is even possible and in what sense [73-77]. Unlike the majority of these works, we exploit duality to derive a principled primal-dual style algorithm from first principles for the adversarial robustness setting.

Constrained optimization. Also related are works that seek to enforce constraints on learning problems [94]. While several heuristic algorithms exist for this setting, many focus on restricted classes of constraints [95-99] and those that can handle more general constraints come at the cost of added computation complexity [100, 101]. Moreover, each of these works seeks to enforce constraints on a particular parameterization for the learning problem (such as directly on the weights of a neural network) rather than on the underlying statistical problem, as we do in this paper. In this way, our work is more related to the primal-dual style algorithms which often arise in convex optimization [89, 102].

# 6 Experiments

In this section, we include an empirical evaluation of the DALE algorithm presented in Algorithm 1. We defer further details concerning implementation and hyperparameter selection to the Appendix.

# 6.1 MNIST

We first consider the MNIST dataset [103]. All defense models use a four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using with the Adadelta optimizer [104]. Throughout, we use a learning rate of 1.0, a batch size of 128, and we use a maximum perturbation radius of  $\epsilon = 0.3$ . In Table 1, we

show the accuracies obtained by running the DALE algorithm for  $L = 1$  and  $L = 100$  steps; we also offer comparison to a range of baselines. Observe that DALE achieves both strong nominal and adversarial performance, beating these state-of-the-art baselines in both categories.

Visualization the distribution of adversarial perturbations. In Section 3, we introduced a new perspective on the problem of generating adversarial examples in which we characterized adversarial perturbations with respect to a worst-case distribution  $\lambda^{\star}$ . To this end, Algorithm 1 is designed to sample from this distribution. In Figure 1, we attempt to visualize the perturbations generated by our algorithm by using principal components analysis (PCA) to embed the adversarial perturbations in a two-dimensional space. In particular, we performed PCA on the MNIST dataset to extract the principle components, and then we projected the perturbations  $\delta$  generated by PGD, FGSM, and DALE in the last iteration of training onto the first two principle components. Notice that the perturbations generated by PGD and FGSM are much more concentrated nearer to the boundary of the region, whereas the perturbations generated by LMC are closer to the origin. Further, PGD and FGSM both vary much more in the second principal component (y-axis) than the first principal component (x-axis) relative to DALE. This indicates that PGD and FGSM may overfit to the first few principal components of the data; in practice, Figure 1 shows that DALE is able to overcome this issue more successfully.

# 6.2 CIFAR-10

We next consider the CIFAR-10 dataset [105]. All defense models were trained using SGD with momentum using the ResNet-18 architecture [106]. Following [60], we use an initial learning rate of 0.01, which was decayed to 0.001 at epoch 75, and then to 0.0001 at epoch 90. All models were trained for 100 epochs using a perturbation radius of  $\epsilon = 8 / 255$ . The clean and robust accuracies for DALE as well as several state-of-the-art baselines are shown in Table 2. Note that the DALE is able to mitigate the tradeoff between robustness and accuracy more successfully than each of the baselines. This highlights the utility of performing dual-ascent in line 11 of Algorithm 1, as both

TRADES and MART use similar objectives to DALE with a fixed penalty weight.

# 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we studied robust learning from a constrained learning perspective. We rigorously proved an equivalence between the standard adversarial training paradigm and a stochastic optimization problem over a specific, non-atomic distribution. This insight provides a new perspective on robust learning, and engenders a natural Langevin Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach for adversarial robustness. We validate experimentally that this algorithm performs similarly, and in some cases outperforms the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks. In future work, we improve the sampling procedure in Algorithm 1 by incorporating more sophisticated samplers.
