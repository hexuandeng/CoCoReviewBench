Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review

# ABSTRACT

We introduce causal implicit generative models (CiGMs): models that allow sampling from not only the true observational but also the true interventional distributions. We show that adversarial training can be used to learn a CiGM, if the generator architecture is structured based on a given causal graph. We consider the application of conditional and interventional sampling of face images with binary feature labels, such as mustache, young. We preserve the dependency structure between the labels with a given causal graph. We devise a two-stage procedure for learning a CiGM over the labels and the image. First we train a CiGM over the binary labels using a Wasserstein GAN where the generator neural network is consistent with the causal graph between the labels. Later, we combine this with a conditional GAN to generate images conditioned on the binary labels. We propose two new conditional GAN architectures: CausalGAN and CausalBEGAN. We show that the optimal generator of the CausalGAN, given the labels, samples from the image distributions conditioned on these labels. The conditional GAN combined with a trained CiGM for the labels is then a CiGM over the labels and the generated image. We show that the proposed architectures can be used to sample from observational and interventional image distributions, even for interventions which do not naturally occur in the dataset.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

An implicit generative model (Mohamed & Lakshminarayanan (2016)) is a mechanism that can sample from a probability distribution without an explicit parameterization of the likelihood. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) arguably provide one of the most successful ways to train implicit generative models. GANs are neural generative models that can be trained using backpropagation to sample from very high dimensional nonparametric distributions (Goodfellow et al. (2014)). A generator network models the sampling process through feedforward computation given a noise vector. The generator output is constrained and refined through feedback by a competitive adversary network, called the discriminator, that attempts to distinguish between the generated and real samples. The objective of the generator is to maximize the loss of the discriminator (convince the discriminator that it outputs samples from the real data distribution). GANs have shown tremendous success in generating samples from distributions such as image and video (Vondrick et al. (2016)).

An extension of GANs is to enable sampling from the class conditional data distributions by feeding class labels to the generator alongside the noise vectors. Various neural network architectures have been proposed for solving this problem (Mirza & Osindero (2014); Odena et al. (2016); Antipov et al. (2017)). However, these architectures do not capture the dependence between the labels. Therefore, they do not have a mechanism to sample images given a subset of the labels, since they cannot sample the remaining labels. In this paper, we are interested in extending the previous work on conditional image generation by  $i$  capturing the dependence between labels and  $ii$  capturing the causal effect between labels. We can think of conditional image generation as a causal process: Labels determine the image distribution. The generator is a non-deterministic mapping from labels to images. This is consistent with the causal graph "Labels cause the Image", denoted by  $L \rightarrow I$ , where  $L$  is the random vector for labels and  $I$  is the image random variable. Using a finer model, we can also include the causal graph between the labels, if available.

Figure 1: Observational and interventional samples from CausalBEGAN. Our architecture can be used to sample not only from the joint distribution (conditioned on a label) but also from the interventional distribution, e.g., under the intervention do(Mustache = 1). The two distributions are clearly different, as is evident from the samples outside the dataset, e.g., females with mustaches.

(b) Top: Intervened on Mustache  $= 1$  .Bottom: Conditioned on Mustache  $= 1$  . Male  $\rightarrow$  Mustache.

As an example, consider the causal graph between Gender  $(G)$  and Mustache  $(M)$  labels. The causal relation is clearly Gender causes Mustache, denoted by the graph  $G \to M$ . Conditioning on Gender = male, we expect to see males with or without mustaches, based on the fraction of males with mustaches in the population. When we condition on Mustache = 1, we expect to sample from males only since the population does not contain females with mustaches. In addition to sampling from conditional distributions, causal models allow us to sample from various different distributions called interventional distributions. An intervention is an experiment that fixes the value of a variable in a causal graph. This affects the distributions of the descendants of the intervened variable in the graph. But unlike conditioning, it does not affect the distribution of its ancestors. For the same causal graph, intervening on Mustache = 1 would not change the distribution of Gender. Accordingly, the label combination (Gender = female, Mustache = 1) would appear as often as Gender = female after the intervention. Please see Figure 1 for some of our conditional and interventional samples, which illustrate this concept on the Bald and Mustache variables.

In this work we propose causal implicit generative models (CiGM): mechanisms that can sample not only from the correct joint probability distributions but also from the correct conditional and interventional probability distributions. Our objective is not to learn the causal graph: we assume that the true causal graph is given to us. We show that when the generator structure inherits its neural connections from the causal graph, GANs can be used to train causal implicit generative models. We use Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) (Arjovsky et al. (2017)) to train a CiGM for binary image labels, as the first step of a two-step procedure for training a CiGM for the images and image labels. For the second step, we propose two novel conditional GANs called CausalGAN and CausalBEGAN. We show that the optimal generator of CausalGAN can sample from the correct conditional distributions, which is summarized by the following theorem.

Theorem 1 (Informal). Let  $G(l, z)$  be the generator output for a given label  $l$  and noise vector  $z$ . Let  $G^{*}$  be the global optimal generator for the loss function in (5), when the rest of the network is at the optimum. Then the generator samples from the conditional image distribution given the label, i.e.,  $\mathbb{P}(G(l, Z) = x) = \mathbb{P}_r((X = x | L = l))$ , where  $\mathbb{P}_r$  is the data probability density function,  $\mathbb{P}_g$  is the probability density function induced by the random variable  $Z$ , and  $X$  is the image.

We show that combining CausalGAN with a CiGM on the labels yields a CiGM on the labels and the image, which is formalized in Corollary 1 in Section 5. Our contributions are as follows:

- We observe that adversarial training can be used after structuring the generator architecture based on the causal graph to train a CiGM. We empirically show that WGAN can be used to learn a CiGM that outputs essentially discrete<sup>1</sup> labels, creating a CiGM for binary labels.  
- We consider the problem of conditional and interventional sampling of images given a causal graph over binary labels. We propose a two-stage procedure to train a CiGM over the binary labels and the image. As part of this procedure, we propose a novel conditional GAN architecture and loss function. We show that the global optimal generator provably samples from the class conditional distributions.  
- We propose a natural but nontrivial extension of BEGAN to accept labels: using the same motivations for margins as in BEGAN (Berthelot et al. (2017)), we arrive at a "margin of margins" term. We show empirically that this model, which we call Causal BEGAN, produces high quality images that capture the image labels.

- We evaluate our CiGM training framework on the labeled CelebA data (Liu et al. (2015)). We empirically show that CausalGAN and CausalBEGAN can produce label-consistent images even for label combinations realized under interventions that never occur during training, e.g., "woman with mustache".

# 2 RELATED WORK

Using a GAN conditioned on the image labels has been proposed before: In Mirza & Osindero (2014), authors propose conditional GAN (CGAN): They extend generative adversarial networks to the setting where there is extra information, such as labels. Image labels are given to both the generator and the discriminator. In Odena et al. (2016), authors propose ACGAN: Instead of receiving the labels as input, the discriminator is now tasked with estimating the label. In Sricharan et al. (2017), the authors compare the performance of CGAN and ACGAN and propose an extension to the semi-supervised setting. In Chen et al. (2016), authors propose a new architecture called InfoGAN, which attempts to maximize a variational lower bound of mutual information between the inputs given to the generator and the image. To the best of our knowledge, the existing conditional GANs do not allow sampling from label combinations that do not appear in the dataset (Sricharan (2017)).

BiGAN (Donahue et al. (2017b)) and ALI (Dumoulin et al. (2017)) extend the standard GAN framework by also learning a mapping from the image space to a latent space. In CoGAN (Liu & Oncel (2016)) the authors learn a joint distribution over an image and its binary label by enforcing weight sharing between generators and discriminators. SD-GAN (Donahue et al. (2017a)) is a similar architecture which splits the latent space into "Identity" and "Observation" portions. To generate faces of the same person, one can then fix the identity portion of the latent code. If we consider the "Identity" and "Observation" codes to be the labels then SD-GAN can be seen as an extension of BEGAN to labels. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the only extension of BEGAN to accept labels before CausalBEGAN. It is not trivial to extend CoGAN and SD-GAN to more than two labels. Authors in Antipov et al. (2017) use CGAN of Mirza & Osindero (2014) with a one-hot encoded vector that encodes the age interval. A generator conditioned on this one-hot vector can then be used for changing the age attribute of a face image. Another application of generative models is in compressed sensing: Authors in Bora et al. (2017) give compressed sensing guarantees for recovering a vector, if the data lies close to the output of a trained generative model.

Using causal principles for deep learning and using deep learning techniques for causal inference has been recently gaining attention. In Lopez-Paz & Oquab (2016), the authors observe the connection between GAN layers, and structural equation models. Based on this observation, they use CGAN (Mirza & Osindero (2014)) to learn the causal direction between two variables from a dataset. In Lopez-Paz et al. (2017), the authors propose using a neural network in order to discover the causal relation between image class labels based on static images. In Bahadori et al. (2017), authors propose a new regularization for training a neural network, which they call causal regularization, in order to assure that the model is predictive in a causal sense. In a very recent work Besserve et al. (2017), authors point out the connection of GANs to causal generative models. However they see image as a cause of the neural net weights, and do not use labels. In an independent parallel work, authors in Goudet et al. (2017) propose using neural networks for learning causal graphs. Similar to us, they also use neural connections to mimic structural equations, but for learning the causal graph.

# 3 BACKGROUND

In this section, we give a brief introduction to causality. Specifically, we use Pearl's framework (Pearl (2009)), i.e., structural causal models (SCMs), which uses structural equations and directed acyclic graphs between random variables to represent a causal model.

Consider two random variables  $X, Y$ . Within the SCM framework and under the causal sufficiency assumption<sup>3</sup>,  $X$  causes  $Y$  means that there exists a function  $f$  and some unobserved random variable  $E$ , independent from  $X$ , such that the value of  $Y$  is determined based on the values of  $X$  and  $E$  through the function  $f$ , i.e.,  $Y = f(X, E)$ . Unobserved variables are also called exogenous. The

causal graph that represents this relation is  $X \to Y$ . In general, a causal graph is a directed acyclic graph implied by the structural equations: The parents of a node  $X_{i}$  in the causal graph, shown by  $Pa_{i}$ , represent the causes of that variable. The causal graph can be constructed from the structural equations as follows: The parents of a variable are those that appear in the structural equation that determines the value of that variable.

Formally, a structural causal model is a tuple  $\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}_{\mathcal{E}}(.))$  that contains a set of functions  $\mathcal{F} = \{f_1,f_2,\dots ,f_n\}$ , a set of random variables  $V = \{X_{1},X_{2},\ldots ,X_{n}\}$ , a set of exogenous random variables  $\mathcal{E} = \{E_1,E_2,\dots ,E_n\}$ , and a product probability distribution over the exogenous variables  $\mathbb{P}_{\mathcal{E}}$ . The set of observable variables  $\mathcal{V}$  has a joint distribution implied by the distribution of  $\mathcal{E}$ , and the functional relations  $\mathcal{F}$ . The causal graph  $D$  is then the directed acyclic graph on the nodes  $\mathcal{V}$ , such that a node  $X_{j}$  is a parent of node  $X_{i}$  if and only if  $X_{j}$  is in the domain of  $f_{i}$ , i.e.,  $X_{i} = f_{i}(X_{j},S,E_{i})$  for some  $S\subset V$ . See the Appendix for more details.

An intervention is an operation that changes the underlying causal mechanism, hence the corresponding causal graph. An intervention on  $X_{i}$  is denoted as  $do(X_{i} = x_{i})$ . It is different from conditioning on  $\bar{X}_{i}$  in the following way: An intervention removes the connections of node  $X_{i}$  to its parents, whereas conditioning does not change the causal graph from which data is sampled. The interpretation is that, for example, if we set the value of  $X_{i}$  to 1, then it is no longer determined through the function  $f_{i}(Pa_{i},E_{i})$ . An intervention on a set of nodes is defined similarly. The joint distribution over the variables after an intervention (post-interventional distribution) can be calculated as follows: Since  $D$  is a Bayesian network for the joint distribution, the observational distribution can be factorized as  $\mathbb{P}(x_1,x_2,\ldots x_n) = \prod_{i\in [n]}\mathbb{P}(x_i|Pa_i)$ , where the nodes in  $Pa_{i}$  are assigned to the corresponding values in  $\{x_{i}\}_{i\in [n]}$ . After an intervention on a set of nodes  $X_{S} := \{X_{i}\}_{i\in S}$ , i.e.,  $do(X_S = s)$ , the post-interventional distribution is given by  $\prod_{i\in [n]\setminus S}\mathbb{P}(x_i|Pa_i^S)$ , where  $Pa_{i}^{S}$  represents the following assignment:  $X_{j} = x_{j}$  for  $X_{j}\in Pa_{i}$  if  $j\notin S$  and  $X_{j} = s(j)$  if  $j\in S^4$ .

In general it is not possible to identify the true causal graph for a set of variables without performing experiments or making additional assumptions. This is because there are multiple causal graphs that allow the same joint probability distribution even for two variables (Spirtes et al. (2001)). This paper does not address the problem of learning the causal graph: We assume that the causal graph is given to us, and we learn a causal model, i.e., the functions comprising the structural equations for some choice of exogenous variables<sup>5</sup>. There is significant prior work on learning causal graphs that could be used before our method (Hoyer et al. (2008); Hyttinen et al. (2013); Hauser & Buhlmann (2014); Shanmugam et al. (2015); Lopez-Paz et al. (2015); Etesami & Kiyavash (2016); Quinn et al. (2015); Kocaoglu et al. (2017)). When the true causal graph is unknown using a Bayesian network that respects the conditional independences in the data allows us to sample from the correct observational distributions. We explore the effect of the used Bayesian network in Section 8.10, 8.11.

# 4 CAUSAL IMPLICIT GENERATIVE MODELS

Implicit generative models can sample from the data distribution. However they do not provide the functionality to sample from interventional distributions. We propose causal implicit generative models, which provide a way to sample from both observational and interventional distributions.

We show that generative adversarial networks can also be used for training causal implicit generative models. Consider the simple causal graph  $X \to Z \gets Y$ . Under the causal sufficiency assumption, this model can be written as  $X = f_{X}(N_{X}), Y = f_{Y}(N_{Y}), Z = f_{Z}(X,Y,N_{Z})$ , where  $f_{X}, f_{Y}, f_{Z}$  are some functions and  $N_{X}, N_{Y}, N_{Z}$  are jointly independent variables. The following simple observation is useful: In the GAN training framework, generator neural network connections can be arranged to reflect the causal graph structure. Please see Figure 2b for this architecture. The feedforward neural networks can be used to represent the functions  $f_{X}, f_{Y}, f_{Z}$ . The noise terms can be chosen as independent, complying with the condition that  $(N_{X}, N_{Y}, N_{Z})$  are jointly independent. Although we do not know the distributions of the exogenous variables, for a rich enough function

class, we can use Gaussian distributed variables (Mooij et al. (2010)). Hence this feedforward neural network can be used to represent the causal models with graph  $X \to Z \gets Y$ .

The following proposition is well known in the causality literature. It shows that given the true causal graph, two causal models that have the same observational distribution have the same interventional distributions for any intervention.  $\mathbb{P}_V$  and  $\mathbb{Q}_V$  stands for the distributions induced on the set of variables in  $V$  by  $\mathbb{P}_{N_1}$  and  $\mathbb{P}_{N_2}$ , respectively.

Proposition 1. Let  $\mathcal{M}_1 = (D_1 = (V,E),N_1,\mathcal{F}_1,\mathbb{P}_{N_1}(.))$ ,  $\mathcal{M}_2 = (D_2 = (V,E),N_2,\mathcal{F}_2,\mathbb{Q}_{N_2}(.))$  be two causal models. If  $\mathbb{P}_V(.) = \mathbb{Q}_V(.)$ , then  $\mathbb{P}_V(.|do(S)) = \mathbb{Q}_V(.|do(S))$

We have the following definition, which ties a feedforward neural network with a causal graph:

Definition 1. Let  $Z = \{Z_{1}, Z_{2}, \ldots, Z_{m}\}$  be a set of mutually independent random variables. A feedforward neural network  $G$  that outputs the vector  $G(Z) = [G_{1}(Z), G_{2}(Z), \ldots, G_{n}(Z)]$  is called consistent with a causal graph  $D = ([n], E)$ , if  $\forall i \in [n]$ ,  $\exists a$  a set of layers  $f_{i}$  such that  $G_{i}(Z)$  can be written as  $G_{i}(Z) = f_{i}(\{G_{j}(Z)\}_{j \in P_{a_{i}}}, Z_{S_{i}})$ , where  $P_{a_{i}}$  are the set of parents of  $i$  in  $D$ , and  $Z_{S_{i}} := \{Z_{j} : j \in S_{i}\}$  are collections of subsets of  $Z$  such that  $\{S_{i} : i \in [n]\}$  is a partition of  $[m]$ .

Based on the definition, we say a feedforward neural network  $G$  with output

$$
G (Z) = \left[ G _ {1} (Z), G _ {2} (Z), \dots , G _ {n} (Z) \right], \tag {1}
$$

is a causal implicit generative model for the causal model  $\mathcal{M} = (D = ([n],E),N,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}_N(.))$  if  $G$  is consistent with the causal graph  $D$  and  $\mathbb{P}(G(Z) = \mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{P}_V(\mathbf{x}),\forall \mathbf{x}$ .

We propose using adversarial training where the generator neural network is consistent with the causal graph according to Definition 1, which is explained in the next section.

# 5 CAUSAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS

CiGMs can be trained with samples from a joint distribution given the causal graph between the variables. However, for the application of image generation with binary labels, we found it difficult to simultaneously learn the joint label and image distribution<sup>6</sup>. For this application, we focus on dividing the task of learning a CiGM into two subtasks: First, we train a generative model over the labels, then train a generative model for the images conditioned on the labels. For this training to be consistent with the causal structure, we assume that the image node is always the sink node of the causal graph for image generation problems (Please see Figure 8 in Appendix). As we show next, our new architecture and loss function (CausalGAN) assures that the optimum generator outputs the label conditioned image distributions. Under the assumption that the joint probability distribution over the labels is strictly positive<sup>7</sup>, combining CiGM for the labels with a label-conditioned image generator gives a CiGM for images and labels (see Corollary 1).

# 5.1 CAUSAL CONTROLLER

First we describe the adversarial training of a CiGM for binary labels. This generative model, which we call the Causal Controller, will be used for controlling which distribution the images will be sampled from when intervened or conditioned on a set of labels. As in Section 4, we structure the Causal Controller network to sequentially produce labels according to the causal graph. Since our theoretical results hold for binary labels, we prefer a generator which can sample from an essentially discrete label distribution<sup>8</sup>. However, the standard GAN training is not suited for learning a discrete distribution, since Jensen-Shannon divergence requires the support to be the same for giving meaningful gradients, which is harder with discrete data distributions. To be able to sample from a discrete distribution, we employ WGAN (Arjovsky et al. (2017)). We used the model of Gulrajani et al. (2017), where the Lipschitz constraint on the gradient is replaced by a penalty term in the loss.

# 5.2 CAUSALGAN

# 5.2.1 ARCHITECTURE

As part of the two-step process proposed in Section 4 for learning a CiGM over the labels and the image variables, we design a new conditional GAN architecture to generate the images based on the labels of the Causal Controller. Unlike previous work, our new architecture and loss function assures that the optimum generator outputs the label conditioned image distributions. We use a pretrained Causal Controller which is not further updated.

Labeler and Anti-Labeler: We have two separate labeler neural networks. The Labeler is trained to estimate the labels of images in the dataset. The Anti-Labeler is trained to estimate the labels of the images sampled from the generator, where image labels are those produced by the Causal Controller.

Generator: The objective of the generator is 3-fold: producing realistic images by competing with the discriminator, producing images consistent with the labels by minimizing the Labeler loss and avoiding unrealistic image distributions that are easy to label by maximizing the Anti-Labeler loss.

The most important distinction of CausalGAN with the existing conditional GAN architectures is that it uses an Anti-Labeler network in addition to a Labeler network. Notice that the theoretical guarantee we develop in Section 5.2.3 does not hold without the Anti-Labeler. Intuitively, the Anti-Labeler loss discourages the generator network to output only few typical faces for a fixed label combination. This is a phenomenon that we call label-conditioned mode collapse. Minibatch-features are one of the most popular techniques used to avoid mode-collapse (Salimans et al. (2016)). However, the diversity within a batch of images due to different label combinations can make this approach ineffective for combating label-conditioned mode collapse. This effect is most prominent for rare label combinations. In general, using Anti-Labeler helps with faster convergence. Please see Section 9.4 in the Appendix for results.

# 5.2.2 LOSS FUNCTIONS

We present the results for a single binary label  $l$ . The results can be extended to more labels. For a single binary label  $l$  and the image  $x$ , we use  $\mathbb{P}_r(l, x)$  for the data distribution between the image and the labels. Similarly  $\mathbb{P}_g(l, x)$  denotes the joint distribution between the labels given to the

generator and the generated images. In our analysis we assume a perfect Causal Controller<sup>9</sup> and use the shorthand  $\mathbb{P}_g(l = 1) = \mathbb{P}_r(l = 1) = \rho = 1 - \bar{\rho}$ . Let  $G(.), D(.), D_{LR}(.)$ , and  $D_{LG}(.)$  are the mappings due to generator, discriminator, Labeler, and Anti-Labeler respectively.

The generator loss function of CausalGAN contains label loss terms, the GAN loss in Goodfellow et al. (2014), and an added loss term due to the discriminator. With the addition of this term to the generator loss, we are able to prove that the optimal generator outputs the class conditional image distribution. This result is also true for multiple binary labels, which is shown in the Appendix.

For a fixed generator, Anti-Labeler solves the following optimization problem:

$$
\max  _ {D _ {L G}} \rho \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim \mathbb {P} _ {g} (x | l = 0)} [ \log (D _ {L G} (x)) ] + \bar {\rho} \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim \mathbb {P} _ {g} (x | l = 1)} [ \log (1 - D _ {L G} (x) ]. \tag {2}
$$

The Labeler solves the following optimization problem:

$$
\max  _ {D _ {L R}} \rho \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim \mathbb {P} _ {r} (x | l = 0)} [ \log (D _ {L R} (x)) ] + \bar {\rho} \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim \mathbb {P} _ {r} (x | l = 1)} [ \log (1 - D _ {L R} (x) ]. \tag {3}
$$

For a fixed generator, the discriminator solves the following optimization problem:

$$
\max  _ {D} \mathbb {E} _ {(l, x) \sim \mathbb {P} _ {r} (l, x)} [ \log (D (x)) ] + \mathbb {E} _ {(l, x) \sim \mathbb {P} _ {g} (l, x)} [ \log (1 - D (x)) ]. \tag {4}
$$

For a fixed discriminator, Labeler and Anti-Labeler, the generator solves the following problem:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \min _ {G} \mathbb {E} _ {(l, x) \sim \mathbb {P} _ {g} (l, x)} \left[ \log \left(\frac {1 - D (x)}{D (x)}\right) \right] - \rho \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim \mathbb {P} _ {g} (x | l = 1)} [ \log (D _ {L R} (X)) ] \\ - \bar {\rho} \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim \mathbb {P} _ {g} (x | l = 0)} [ \log (1 - D _ {L R} (X)) ] + \rho \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim \mathbb {P} _ {g} (x | l = 1)} [ \log (D _ {L G} (X)) ] \\ + \bar {\rho} \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim \mathbb {P} _ {g} (x | l = 0)} [ \log (1 - D _ {L G} (X)) ]. \tag {5} \\ \end{array}
$$

# 5.2.3 THEORETICAL GUARANTEES

We show that the best CausalGAN generator for the given loss function samples from the class conditional image distribution when Causal Controller samples from the true label distribution and the discriminator and labeler networks always operate at their optimum. We show this result for the case of a single binary label  $l \in \{0,1\}$ . The proof can be extended to multiple binary variables, which is given in the Appendix. As far as we are aware of, this is the only conditional generative adversarial network architecture with this guarantee after CGAN<sup>10</sup>.

First, we find the optimal discriminator for a fixed generator. Note that in (4), the terms that the discriminator can optimize are the same as the GAN loss in Goodfellow et al. (2014). Hence the optimal discriminator behaves the same. To characterize the optimum discriminator, labeler and anti-labeler, we have Proposition 2, Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 given in the appendix.

Let  $C(G)$  be the generator loss for when the discriminator, Labeler and Anti-Labeler are at the optimum. Then the generator that minimizes  $C(G)$  samples from the class conditional distributions:

Theorem 2 (Theorem 1 formal for single binary label). Assume  $\mathbb{P}_g(l) = \mathbb{P}_r(l)$ . Then the global minimum of the virtual training criterion  $C(G)$  is achieved if and only if  $\mathbb{P}_g(l,x) = \mathbb{P}_r(l,x)$ , i.e., if and only if given a label  $l$ , generator output  $G(z,l)$  has the same distribution as the class conditional image distribution  $\mathbb{P}_r(x|l)$ .

Now we can show that our two stage procedure can be used to train a causal implicit generative model for any causal graph where the Image variable is a sink node, captured by the following corollary.  $\mathcal{L},\mathcal{I},\mathcal{Z}_1,\mathcal{Z}_2$  represent the space of labels, images, and noise variables, respectively.

Corollary 1. Suppose  $C: \mathcal{Z}_1 \to \mathcal{L}$  is a causal implicit generative model for the causal graph  $D = (\mathcal{V}, E)$  where  $\mathcal{V}$  is the set of image labels and the observational joint distribution over these labels are strictly positive. Let  $G: \mathcal{L} \times \mathcal{Z}_2 \to \mathcal{I}$  be a generator that can sample from the image distribution conditioned on the given label combination  $L \in \mathcal{L}$ . Then  $G(C(Z_1), Z_2)$  is a causal implicit generative model for the causal graph  $D' = (\mathcal{V} \cup \{\text{Image}\}, E \cup \{(V_1, \text{Image}), (V_2, \text{Image}), \ldots, (V_n, \text{Image})\})$ .

In Theorem 2 we show that the optimum generator samples from the class conditional distributions given a single binary label. Our objective is to extend this result to the case with  $d$  binary labels. First we show that if the Labeler and Anti-Labeler are trained to output  $2^{d}$  scalars, each interpreted as the posterior probability of a particular label combination given the image, then the minimizer of  $C(G)$  samples from the class conditional distributions given  $d$  labels. This result is shown in Theorem 3 in the supplementary material. However, when  $d$  is large, this architecture may be hard to implement. To resolve this, we propose an alternative architecture, which we implement for our experiments: We extend the single binary label setup and use cross entropy loss terms for each label. This requires Labeler and Anti-Labeler to have only  $d$  outputs. However, although we need the generator to capture the joint label posterior given the image, this only assures that the generator captures each label's posterior distribution, i.e.,  $\mathbb{P}_r(l_i|x) = \mathbb{P}_g(l_i|x)$  (Proposition 3). This, in general, does not guarantee that the class conditional distributions will be true to the data distribution. However, for many joint distributions of practical interest, where the set of labels are completely determined by the image $^{11}$ , we show that this guarantee implies that the joint label posterior will be true to the data distribution, implying that the optimum generator samples from the class conditional distributions. Please see Section 8.7 for the formal results and more details.

# 5.3 CAUSALBEGAN

In this section, we sketch a simple, but non-trivial extension of BEGAN where we feed image labels to the generator, leaving the details to the Appendix (Section 8.8). To accommodate interventional sampling, we again use the Causal Controller to produce labels.

In terms of architecture modifications, we use a Labeler network with a dual purpose: to label real images well and generated images poorly. This network can be seen as both analogous to the original two-rolled BEGAN discriminator and analogous to the CausalGAN Labeler and Anti-Labeler.

In terms of margin modifications, we are motivated by the following observations: (1) Just as a better trained BEGAN discriminator creates more useful gradients for image quality, (2) a better trained Labeler is a prerequisite for meaningful gradients for label quality. Finally, (3) label gradients are most informative when the image quality is high. Each observation suggests a margin term; the final observation suggests a (necessary) margin of margins term comparing the first two margins.

# 6 RESULTS

In this section, we train CausalGAN and CausalBEGAN using a trained Causal Controller (See Section 8.11 for Causal Controller results.). Please see Section 9.2 for implementation details. The results are given in Figures 4 - 7. The difference between intervening and conditioning is clear through certain features. We implement conditioning through rejection sampling. See Naesseth et al. (2017); Graham & Storkey (2017) for other works on conditioning for implicit generative models.

Top: Intervene Mustache=1, Bottom: Condition Mustache=1

Figure 4: Intervening/Conditioning on Mustache label in Causal Graph 1. Since  $Male \rightarrow Mustache$  in Causal Graph 1, we do not expect  $do(Mustache = 1)$  to affect the probability of  $Male = 1$ , i.e.,  $\mathbb{P}(Male = 1|do(Mustache = 1)) = \mathbb{P}(Male = 1) = 0.42$ . Accordingly, the top row shows both males and females with mustaches, even though the generator never sees the label combination  $\{Male = 0, Mustache = 1\}$  during training. The bottom row of images sampled from the conditional distribution  $\mathbb{P}(|Mustache| = 1)$  shows only male images.

Figure 5: Intervening/Conditioning on Mouth Slightly Open label in Causal Graph 1. Since Smiling  $\rightarrow$  MouthSlightlyOpen in Causal Graph 1, we do not expect do(Mouth Slightly Open  $= 1$ ) to affect the probability of Smiling  $= 1$ , i.e.,  $\mathbb{P}(Smiling = 1|do(MouthSlightlyOpen = 1)) = \mathbb{P}(Smiling = 1) = 0.48$ . However on the bottom row, conditioning on Mouth Slightly Open  $= 1$  increases the proportion of smiling images (From 0.48 to 0.76 in the dataset), although 10 images may not be enough to show this difference statistically.

Figure 6: Intervening/Conditioning on Mustache label in Causal Graph 1. Since  $Male \rightarrow Mustache$  in Causal Graph 1, we do not expect  $do(Mustache = 1)$  to affect the probability of  $Male = 1$ , i.e.,  $\mathbb{P}(Male = 1|do(Mustache = 1)) = \mathbb{P}(Male = 1) = 0.42$ . Accordingly, the top row shows both males and females with mustaches, even though the generator never sees the label combination  $\{Male = 0, Mustache = 1\}$  during training. The bottom row of images sampled from the conditional distribution  $\mathbb{P}(|Mustache| = 1)$  shows only male images.  
Top: Intervene Narrow Eyes=1, Bottom: Condition Narrow Eyes=1  
Figure 7: Intervening/Conditioning on Narrow Eyes label in Causal Graph 1. Since Smiling  $\rightarrow$  Narrow Eyes in Causal Graph 1, we do not expect  $do(NarrowEyes = 1)$  to affect the probability of Smiling  $= 1$ , i.e.,  $\mathbb{P}(Smiling = 1|do(NarrowEyes = 1)) = \mathbb{P}(Smiling = 1) = 0.48$ . However on the bottom row, conditioning on Narrow Eyes  $= 1$  increases the proportion of smiling images (From 0.48 to 0.59 in the dataset), although 10 images may not be enough to show this difference statistically. As a rare artifact, in the dark image in the third column the generator appears to rule out the possibility of Narrow Eyes  $= 0$  instead of demonstrating Narrow Eyes  $= 1$ .

# 7 CONCLUSION

We proposed a novel generative model with label inputs. In addition to being able to create samples conditioned on labels, our generative model can also sample from the interventional distributions. Our theoretical analysis provides provable guarantees about correct sampling under such interventions. Causality leads to generative models that are more creative since they can produce samples that are different from their training samples in multiple ways. We have illustrated this point for two models (CausalGAN and CausalBEGAN).
