# ABSTRACT

Explainability of black-box predictive models has gained considerable attention within our research community given the importance of deploying more reliable machine-learning systems. Explanability can also be helpful for model debugging. In computer vision applications, most methods explain models by displaying the regions in the input image that they focus on for their prediction, but it is difficult to improve models based on these explanations since they do not indicate why the model fail. Counterfactual methods, on the other hand, indicate how to perturb the input to change the model prediction, providing details about the model's decision-making. Unfortunately, current counterfactual methods make ambiguous interpretations as they combine multiple biases of the model and the data in a single counterfactual interpretation of the model's decision. Moreover, these methods tend to generate trivial counterfactuals about the model's decision, as they often suggest to exaggerate or remove the presence of the attribute being classified. Trivial counterfactuals are usually not valuable, since the information they provide is often already known to the system's designer. In this work, we propose a counterfactual method that learns a perturbation in a disentangled latent space that is constrained using a diversity-enforcing loss to uncover multiple valuable explanations about the model's prediction. Further, we introduce a mechanism to prevent the model from producing trivial explanations. Experiments on CelebA demonstrate that our model improves the success rate of producing high-quality valuable explanations when compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We will make the code publicly available on github.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Consider a face authentication system for unlocking a device. In case of non-authentications (possible false-negative predictions), this system could provide generic advices to its user such as "face the camera" or "remove any face occlusions". However, these may not explain the reason for the possible malfunction. To provide more insights regarding its decisions, the system could instead provide information specific to the captured image (its input data). It might list the input feature that most contributed to its decision (e.g., as a region of the input image), but this feature could be "face", which is trivial and does not suggest an alternative action to its user. Further, it provides little useful information about the model. Instead, valuable and diverse explanations may be key for better understanding and diagnosing the system—including the data it was trained on—and improving its reliability. Such explanations might improve systems across a wide variety of domains including in medical imaging [45], automated driving systems [36], and quality control in manufacturing [19].

The explainability literature aims to understand the decisions made by black-box models such as the aforementioned face authentication system. Counterfactual explanation methods [10, 12, 4] can help discover the limitations of black-box models by uncovering data and model biases. The counterfactual explanation methods provide perturbed versions of the input data that emphasize features that contributed most to the black-box model's output. For example, if an authentication system is not recognizing a user wearing sunglasses then the system could generate an alternative image of the user's face without sunglasses that would be correctly recognized. This is different from other types of explainability methods such as feature importance methods [38, 39, 4] and boundary approximation methods [35, 29]. The former highlight salient regions of the input but do not indicate how the black-box could achieve a different prediction. The second family of methods produce

explanations that are limited to linear approximations of the black-box model. Unfortunately, these linear approximations are often inaccurate. In contrast, counterfactual methods suggest changes in the input that would lead to a change in the corresponding output, providing information not only about where the change should be but also what the change should be.

Counterfactual explanations should be actionable and proximal [37, 30]. For example, an actionable explanation would suggest feasible changes like removing sunglasses instead of unrealistic ones like adding more eyes to the user's face. Most actionable explanations are proximal to the input, since it is easier to interpret a perturbed input that only changes a small number of attributes. The last desideratum is for explanations to be diverse [37, 30] thereby providing a set of actionable changes that each shed light on the model's prediction.

Current counterfactual generation methods like xGEM [23] generate a single explanation that is far from the input. Thus, they fail to be proximal, diverse, and actionable. Progressive Exaggeration (PE) [41] provides higher-quality explanations, making them more proximal than xGEM but still fails to provide a diverse set of non-trivial explanations. Like previous methods in the literature, both methods also tend to provide obvious (or not valuable) explanations about why the model is making a certain decision. Moreover, their image generator must be trained on the same data as the black-box model in order to detect biases thereby limiting their applicability.

We propose Diverse Valuable Explanations (DiVE), an explainability method that can interpret a black-box model by identifying sets of valuable attributes that have the most effect on the model's output. DiVE produces multiple counterfactual explanations which are actionable, diverse, valuable and more proximal than the previous literature. Our method first learns a generative model of the data using a  $\beta$ -TCVAE [5] to obtain a disentangled latent representation. Unlike PE, training DiVE does not require the original data used to train the black-box model nor the black-box itself. DiVE then learns a latent perturbation using constraints to ensure diversity and proximality. In addition, DiVE leverages the Fisher information matrix of its latent space to focus its search on the less influential factors of variation of the black-box. This mechanism enables the discovery of spurious correlations learned by the black-box.

We first test our method using two existing benchmarks. Using the first, we compare the quality of the explanations with xGEM [23] and Progressive exaggeration [41]. With the second, we evaluate our model's ability to detect biases in the black-box model and the data. We also introduce a new benchmark where we evaluate the model's ability to generate valuable explanations, i.e., which are simultaneously proximal and actionable. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in the first two setups, and establishes the first baseline for the setup of valuable explanations.

We summarize the contributions of this work as follows:

1. We propose DiVE, an explainability method that can interpret a black-box model by identifying the attributes that have the most effect on its output.  
2. DiVE achieves state of the art in terms of the quality of the explanations, detecting biases on the datasets, and producing multiple explanations for an image.  
3. We propose a new benchmark to evaluate how valuable the explanations are, and we set a first strong baseline with DiVE.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a suite of techniques developed to make either the construction or interpretation of model decisions more accessible and meaningful. Broadly speaking, there are two branches of work in XAI, ad-hoc and post-hoc.

Ad-hoc methods focus on making models interpretable, by imbuing model components or parameters with interpretations that are rooted in the data themselves [33, 31, 22]. Unfortunately, most successful machine learning methods, including deep learning ones, are uninterpretable [6, 26, 15, 21].

Post-hoc methods aim to explain the decisions of non interpretable model. Gradient based feature attribution methods [46, 47, 40, 42, 38, 1, 39] and reference based feature attribution methods [39, 10, 5, 7, 4] identify the input features responsible for the greatest change in the model outcome. However they do not explain how to modify these features to change the model outcome. Closest

Figure 1: DiVE encodes the input image (left) to explain into a latent representation  $z$ . Then  $z$  is perturbed by  $\epsilon$  and decoded as counterfactual examples. During training,  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{adv}}$  finds the set of  $\epsilon$  that change the blackbox classifier outcome while  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{div}}$  and  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{reg}}$  enforce that the samples are diverse while staying similar to the input image. This example was taken from the experiment presented in Section 4.3. Specifically, all counterfactuals are classified as "Not bald" by the black-box classifier, as denoted by the black text. However, humans as well as our oracle classify the bottom ones as "Bald". We thus call these counterfactuals non-trivial, denoted here by the red crossmark. These counterfactuals identify a weakness in the blackbox model.

to our work are the counterfactual explanation methods [23, 9, 14, 30, 41] which generate perturbed versions of observed data that result in a corresponding change in the model prediction. While these methods are able to explain a model outcome, they fail to provide a diverse set of non-trivial explanations. In this work we propose DiVE, a counterfactual explanation method that generates actionable, proximal, diverse and non-trivial explanations. Appendix A provides a more exhaustive review of the related work.

# 3 PROPOSED METHOD

We propose DiVE, an explainability method that can interpret a black-box model by identifying the latent attributes that have the most effect on its output. Summarized in Figure 1, DiVE uses an encoder, a decoder, and fixed weight black-box model. The black-box model could be any function for which we have access to its gradients. In this work, we focus on a binary image classifier in order to produce visual explanations. DiVE consists of two main steps. First, the encoder and the decoder are trained in an unsupervised manner to approximate the data distribution on which the black-box model was trained. Unlike PE [41], our encoder-decoder model does not need to train on the same dataset that the black-box model was trained on. Second, we optimize a set of vectors  $\epsilon_{i}$  to perturb the latent representation  $\mathbf{z}$  generated by the trained encoder. The details of the optimization procedure are provided in Algorithm 1 in the Appendix. We use the following 3 main losses for this optimization: an adversarial loss  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{adv}}$  that attempts to fool the black-box model, an adversarial regularization loss  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{reg}}$  that constrains the explanations with respect to the number of changing attributes, and a diversity loss  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{div}}$  that enforces the model to produce multiple explanations with only one confounding factor for each of them. Next we explain the methodology in more detail.

# 3.1 OBTAINING MEANINGFUL REPRESENTATIONS.

Given a data sample  $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ , its corresponding target  $y \in \{0,1\}$ , and a potentially biased black-box model  $f(\mathbf{x})$  that approximates  $p(y|\mathbf{x})$ , our method finds perturbed version of the same input  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$  that produces a desired probabilistic outcome  $\tilde{y} \in [0,1]$ , so that  $f(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}) = \tilde{y}$ . In order to produce semantically meaningful counterfactual explanations, perturbations are performed on a latent representation

$\mathbf{z} \in \mathcal{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$  of the input  $\mathbf{x}$ . Ideally, each dimension in  $\mathcal{Z}$  represents a different semantic concept of the data, i.e., the different dimensions are disentangled.

For training the encoder-decoder architecture we use  $\beta$ -TCVAE [5] since it has been shown to obtain competitive disentanglement performance [28]. It follows the same encoder-decoder structure as the VAE [25], i.e., the input data is first encoded by a neural network  $q_{\phi}(z|\mathbf{x})$  parameterized by  $\phi$ . Then, the input data is recovered by a decoder neural network  $p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}|z)$ , parameterized by  $\theta$ . Using a prior  $p(z)$  and a uniform distribution over the indexes of the dataset  $p(i)$ , the original VAE loss is:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {V A E} = \mathbb {E} _ {p (i)} \mathbb {E} _ {q (z | \mathbf {x} _ {i})} [ \log p _ {\theta} (\mathbf {x} _ {i} | z) ] - \mathbb {E} _ {p (i)} D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(q _ {\phi} (z | \mathbf {x} _ {i}) | | p (z)\right), \tag {1}
$$

where the first term is the reconstruction loss and the second is the average divergence from the prior. The core difference of  $\beta$ -TCVAE is the decomposition of this average divergence:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} _ {p (i)} D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(q _ {\phi} (z | \mathbf {x} _ {i}) | | p (z)\right)\rightarrow D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(q _ {\phi} (z, \mathbf {x} _ {i}) | | q _ {\phi} (z) p _ {\theta} (\mathbf {x} _ {i})\right) + \sum_ {j} D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(q _ {\phi} (z _ {j}) | | p (z _ {j})\right) \\ + \beta \cdot D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(q _ {\phi} (z) | | \prod_ {j} q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {j}\right)\right), \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

where the arrow represents a modification of the left terms and equality is obtained when  $\beta = 1$ . The third term on the right hand side is called total correlation and measures the shared information between all empirical marginals  $q_{\phi}(z_j) = \mathbb{E}_{p(i)}q_{\phi}(z_j|\mathbf{x}_i)$ . By using  $\beta > 1$ , this part is amplified and encourages further decorrelations between the latent variables and leads to better disentanglement.

In addition to  $\beta$ -TCVAE, we use the perceptual reconstruction loss from Hou et al. [17]. This replaces the pixel-wise reconstruction loss in Equation 1 by a perceptual reconstruction loss, using the hidden representation of a pre-trained neural network  $R$ . Specifically, we learn a decoder  $D_{\theta}$  generating an image i.e.,  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = D_{\theta}(\mathbf{z})$ , and this image is re-encoded in a hidden representation:  $\boldsymbol{h} = R(\tilde{\mathbf{x}})$ , and compared to the original image in the same space using a normal distribution. The reconstruction loss of Equation 1 now becomes:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {p (i)} \mathbb {E} _ {q (\mathbf {z} | \mathbf {x} _ {i})} [ \log \mathcal {N} (R (\mathbf {x} _ {i}); R (D _ {\theta} (\mathbf {z})), I) ], \tag {3}
$$

Once trained, the weights of the encoder and the decoder are kept fixed for the rest of the steps of our algorithm.

# 3.2 INTERPRETING THE BLACK-BOX MODEL

In order to find weaknesses in the black-box model, the explainer searches for a collection of  $n$  latent perturbation  $\{\pmb {\epsilon}_i\}_{i = 1}^n$  such that the decoded output  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i = D_\theta (\mathbf{z} + \pmb {\epsilon}_i)$  yields a specific response from the black-box model, i.e.,  $f(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}) = \tilde{y}$  for any chosen  $\tilde{y}\in [0,1]$ . We optimize  $\pmb{\epsilon}_i$ 's by minimizing:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {D i V E}} (\mathbf {x}, \tilde {y}, \{\epsilon_ {i} \} _ {i = 1} ^ {n}) = \sum_ {i} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {a d v}} (\mathbf {x}, \tilde {y}, \boldsymbol {\epsilon} _ {i}) + \lambda \cdot \sum_ {i} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {r e g}} (\mathbf {x}, \boldsymbol {\epsilon} _ {i}) + \alpha \cdot \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {d i v}} (\{\boldsymbol {\epsilon} _ {i} \} _ {i = 1} ^ {n}), \tag {4}
$$

where  $\lambda$ , and  $\alpha$  determine the relative importance of the losses. We now describe these terms.

Adversarial loss. The goal of this loss function is to identify a change of latent attributes that will cause the black-box classifier  $f$  to change its prediction. For example, in face recognition, if the classifier detects that there is a smile present whenever the hair is brown, then this loss function is likely to change the hair color attribute. This is achieved by sampling from the decoder  $\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = D_{\theta}(\mathbf{z} + \epsilon)$ , and optimizing the binary cross-entropy between the target  $\tilde{y}$  and the prediction  $f(\tilde{\mathbf{x}})$ :

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {a d v}} (\mathbf {x}, \tilde {y}, \epsilon) = \tilde {y} \cdot \log (f (\tilde {\mathbf {x}})) + (1 - \tilde {y}) \cdot \log (1 - f (\tilde {\mathbf {x}})). \tag {5}
$$

Note that since the function  $f$  and decoder  $p_{\theta}$  have fixed parameters, there is no min-max game to be solved. Hence our algorithm does not suffer from traditional instabilities of adversarial algorithms.

Regularization loss. The goal of this loss function is to constrain the reconstruction produced by the decoder to be similar in appearance and attributes as the input. It consists of the following two terms,

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {r e g}} (\mathbf {x}, \epsilon) = | | \mathbf {x} - \tilde {\mathbf {x}} | | _ {1} + \gamma \cdot | | \epsilon | | _ {1}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\gamma$  is a scalar weighting the relative importance of the two terms. The first term ensures that the explanations can be related to the input by constraining the input and the output to be similar. The second term aims to identify a sparse perturbation to the latent space  $\mathcal{Z}$  that confounds the black-box model. This sparsity constrains the explainer to identify the least amount of attributes that affect the classifier's decision in order to produce proximal and actionable explanations.

Diversity loss. This loss prevents the multiple explanations of the model from being identical. For instance, if gender and hair color are spuriously correlated with smile, the model should provide images either with different gender or different hair color. To achieve this, we jointly optimize for a collection of  $n$  perturbations  $\{\pmb {\epsilon}_i\}_{i = 1}^n$  and minimize their pairwise similarity:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {d i v}} \left(\left\{\boldsymbol {\epsilon} _ {i} \right\} _ {i = 1} ^ {n}\right) = \sqrt {\sum_ {i \neq j} \left(\frac {\boldsymbol {\epsilon} _ {i} ^ {T}}{\| \boldsymbol {\epsilon} _ {i} \| _ {2}} \frac {\boldsymbol {\epsilon} _ {j}}{\| \boldsymbol {\epsilon} _ {j} \| _ {2}}\right) ^ {2}}. \tag {7}
$$

Beyond trivial counterfactual explanations. Minimizing the losses above may produce trivial counterfactual explanations. For instance, in order to explain why a classifier incorrectly classified an image as containing a "smiling" face, the explainer could just exaggerate smile on that face, without considering other valuable biases in the black-box model such as hair color. While the diversity loss encourages the orthogonality of the explanations, there might still be several latent variables required to represent all variations of smile. To address this, we partition  $\mathcal{Z}$  into subsets of latent factors that interact with each other when changing the predictions of the black-box. Such interaction can be estimated using the average Fisher information matrix:

$$
\boldsymbol {F} = \mathbb {E} _ {p (i)} \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} (\mathbf {z} | \mathbf {x} _ {i})} \mathbb {E} _ {p (y | \mathbf {z})} \nabla_ {\mathbf {z}} \ln p (y | \mathbf {z}) \nabla_ {\mathbf {z}} \ln p (y | \mathbf {z}) ^ {T}, \tag {8}
$$

where  $p(y = 1|\mathbf{z}) = f(D_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}))$  , and  $p(y = 0|\mathbf{z}) = 1 - f(D_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}))$

Next, using  $\pmb{F}$  as an affinity measure, we use spectral clustering [43] to obtain a partition of  $\mathcal{Z}$ . This partition is represented as a collection of mask  $\{m_i\}_{i=1}^n$ , where  $m_i \in \{0,1\}^d$  represents which dimensions of  $\mathcal{Z}$  are part of cluster  $i$ . Finally, these masks are used in Equation 4 to bound each  $\epsilon_i$  to its subspace i.e.,  $\epsilon_i' = \epsilon_i \circ m_i$ , where  $\circ$  represents element-wise multiplication. Since these mask are orthogonal, this effectively replaces  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{div}}$ . In Section 4, we highlight the benefits of this clustering approach by comparing to other baselines.

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, we evaluate the described methods on 3 different aspects: (1) the quality of the generated explanations in Section 4.1; (2) the ability to discover biases within the black-box model and the data in Section 4.2; and (3) the ability to identify diverse valuable explanations for image misclassifications made by the black-box model in Section 4.3.

Experimental Setup. As common procedure [23, 9, 41], we perform experiments on the CelebA database [27]. CelebA is a large-scale dataset containing more than 200K celebrity facial images. Each image is annotated with 40 binary attributes such as "Smiling", "Male", and "Eyeglasses". These attributes allow us to evaluate counterfactual explanations by determining whether they could highlight spurious correlations between multiple attributes such as "lipstick" and "smile". In this setup, explainability methods do not have access to the labeled attributes during training. The labels can only be used during validation.

We compare four versions of our method to three existing methods. (1) DiVE is based on Section 3 but does not mask the gradient updates of  $\epsilon$ . (2) DiVE-- is the same as DiVE but uses the MAE reconstruction loss on the pixel space for training the autoencoder. (3) DiVEFisher extends DiVE by using the diagonal of the Fisher Information Matrix on the latent features and masks based on the partitions extracted from a sorted list of Fisher magnitudes. (4) DiVEFisherSpectral is the same as DiVEFisher but uses spectral clustering for obtaining the partitions as described at the end of Section 3. (5) xGEM as described in Joshi et al. [23]. (6) xGEM+ is the same as xGem but uses the same auto-encoding architecture as DiVE. (7) PE as described by Singla et al. [41]. For our methods, we provide implementation details, architecture description, and algorithm in Appendix D.

# 4.1 COUNTERFACTUAL EXPLANATION QUALITY

We evaluate the quality of the counterfactual explanations using FID scores [16] as described by Singla et al. [41]. The scores are based on the target attributes "Smiling" and "Young", and are divided into 3 categories: Present, Absent, and Overall. Present considers explanations for which

the black-box model outputs a probability greater than 0.9 for the target attribute. Absent refers to explanations for which the black-box model outputs a probability lower than 0.1 for the target attribute. Overall considers all the successful counterfactuals, which changed the original prediction of the black-box model.

We report these scores in Table 1 for all 3 categories. DiVE produces the best quality counterfactuals, surpassing PE by 6.3 FID points for the "Smiling" target and 19.6 FID points for the "Young" target in the Overall category. DiVE obtains lower FID than xGEM+ which shows that the improvement not only comes from the superior architecture of our method. Further, there are two other factors that explain the improvement of DiVE's FID. First, the  $\beta$ -TCVAE decomposition of the KL divergence improves the disentanglement ability of the model while suffering less reconstruction degradation than the VAE. Second, the perceptual loss makes the image quality constructed by DiVE to be comparable with that of the GAN used in PE.

In Figure 2a we show qualitative results obtained by targeting different probability ranges for the output of the black-box model as described in PE. Note that PE directly optimizes the generative model to take an input variable  $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$  that defines the desired output probability  $\tilde{y} = f(\mathbf{x}) + \delta$ . To obtain explanations at different probability targets, we train a second order spline on the trajectory of perturbations produced during the gradient descent steps of our method. As seen in Figure 2a, DiVE produces more natural-looking facial expressions than xGEM+ and PE. In Figure 2a it can be seen that, even though DiVE is not explicitly trained to produce exemplars at intermediate target probabilities, our explanations are more correlated with the target probabilities than PE. Additional results for "Smiling" and "Young" are provided in Figures 4 and 5 in the Appendix.

# 4.2 BIAS DETECTION

We evaluate DiVE's ability to detect biases in the data. We follow the same procedure as PE [41], and train two binary classifiers for the attribute "Smiling". The first one is trained on a biased version of CelebA where all the male celebrities are smiling and all the female are not smiling ( $f_{biased}$ ). The second one is trained on the unbiased version of the data ( $f_{unbiased}$ ). Both classifiers are evaluated on the same validation set. Also following Singla et al. [41], we train an oracle classifier  $f_{oracle}$  based on VGGFace2 [3] which obtains perfect accuracy on the gender attribute. The hypothesis is that if "Smiling" and gender are confounded by the classifier, so should be the explanations. Therefore, we could identify biases when the generated examples not only change the target attribute but also the confounded one.

In Table 2, we follow the procedure in [41] and report the ratio of counterfactual explanations for "Smiling" that change the "Gender" attribute of the  $f_{\text{biased}}$  and  $f_{\text{unbiased}}$  classifiers. To generate the counterfactuals, DiVE produces perturbations until it changes the original prediction of the classifier from, say, "Smiling" to "Non-Smiling". We also see that DiVE is more successful than PE at detecting biases although the generative model of DiVE was not trained with the biased data. While, in some cases, xGEM+ has a higher success rate at detecting biases, it produces lower-quality images that are far from the input. In fact, Table 3 in the Appendix shows that DiVE is more successful at preserving the identity of the faces than PE and xGEM. These results suggest that the combination

Figure 2: Bias Detection experiment. Each column presents an explanation for a target "Smiling" probability interval. Rows contain explanations produced by PE [41] and our DiVE. (a) of a gender-unbiased classifier, and (b) corresponds to explanations of a gender-biased "Smile" classifier. The classifier output probability is displayed on top of the images while the oracle prediction for gender is displayed at the bottom.

of a disentangled latent features and the regularization of the latent features help DiVE to produce the minimal perturbations of the input that produce a successful counterfactual.

In Figure 2b, we provide samples generated by our method with the two classifiers and compare them to PE, and extend it with xGEM+ in Figure 6 in the Appendix. As it can be seen, the gender changes with the "Smiling" attribute with  $f_{\text{biased}}$  while for  $f_{\text{unbiased}}$  it stays the same. In addition, we also observed that for  $f_{\text{biased}}$  the correlation between "Smile" and "Gender" is higher than for PE. It can also be observed that xGEM+ fails to retain the identity of the person in x when compared to PE and our method.

# 4.3 BEYOND TRIVIAL EXPLANATIONS

Previous works on counterfactual generations tend to produce trivial input perturbations to change the output of the black-box model. That is, they often tend to directly increase/decrease the presence of the attribute that the classifier is predicting. For instance, in Figure 2a all the explainers put a smile on the input face in order to increase the probability for "smile". While that is correct, this explanation does not provide much insight about the decisions of the black-box model. Instead, in this work we emphasize producing valuable or non-trivial explanations, that are different from the main attribute that the black-box model has been trained to identify. These kind of explanations provide more insight about the factors that affect the classifier and thus provide cues on how to improve the model or how to fix incorrect predictions.

Figure 3: Beyond trivial explanations experiment. Success rate (y-axis) plotted against VGG similarity (x-axis) for all methods. For both metrics, higher is better. The dot denotes the mean of the performances and the curves are compute with KDE. All DiVE methods outperform xGEM+ on both metrics simultaneously when conditioning on successful counterfactuals.  
(b) successful counterfactuals only

To evaluate this, we propose a new benchmark that measures a method's ability to generate valuable explanations. We define a valuable explanation as one that is 1) misclassified by the black-box model (according to a human) and 2) has not diverged too much from the original sample. A misclassification provides insights into the weaknesses of the model. However, the counterfactual is even more insightful when it stays close to the original image as it singles-out spurious correlations learned by the black-box model. Because it is costly to provide human evaluation of an automatic benchmark, we approximate both the proximity and the real class with the VGGFace2-based oracle. For 1) we deem that an explanation is successful if the black-box and the oracle make different predictions about the counterfactual. E.g., the top counterfactuals in Figure 1 are not deemed successful explanations because both the black-box classifier and the oracle agree on its class, however the two bottoms ones are successful because only the oracle made the correct prediction. These explanations where generated by DiVE-FS. As for 2) we measure the proximity with the cosine distance between the sample and the counterfactual in the feature space of the oracle.

We test all methods introduced in Section 4 on a subset of the CelebA validation set described in Appendix E. We report the results of the hyperparameter search (see Appendix E) in Figure 3. We show results for all explanations in Figure 3a and only when the generated images are counterfactuals in Figure 3b. The dots denote the mean performances and the curves are computed with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). On average, DiVE improves the similarity metric over xGEM+ highlighting the importance of disentangled representations for identity preservation. Moreover, using information from the diagonal of the Fisher Information Matrix as described in further improves performance. Finally, the proposed spectral clustering of the full Fisher Matrix attains the best performance. Also, discarding non-counterfactuals improves the success rate.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose DiVE, a model for generating diverse and valuable explanations of a model's decision. During training, the model optimizes an auto-encoder that learns a disentangled representation of the data. At test time, the model optimizes a perturbation vector of the latent representation in order to generate explanations. This optimization involves an adversarial loss, a diversity-enforcing loss and an adversarial regularization loss. Further, our model uses the Fisher Information Matrix to mask the most influential dimensions of the latent features to enforce the model to produce more valuable explanations that are beyond trivial. Our experiments show that previous methods are limited to single explanations whereas ours can produce multiple, diverse explanations. The results also show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of proximity and actionability on the CelebA dataset.
