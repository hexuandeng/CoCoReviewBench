# ABSTRACT

The task of modeling time series data that exhibit sudden regime shifts has been an enduring focus of research due to its inherent complexity. Among the various strategies to tackle this issue, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been extensively investigated, which captures the regime changes by modeling the transition between latent states. Despite its popularity, the HMM-based methodology carries certain limitations, including specific distribution assumptions and its computational intensity for inference and learning, particularly when the number of change points is unidentified. In this work, we propose a novel approach that models the location of change points and introduce the TV-HMM, a variant of the Hidden Markov Model incorporating the time-varying location transition matrix. Based on the novel modeling scheme, we propose an associated variational EM algorithm that simultaneously detects the locations and the number of change points, together with inferring the posterior distributions of regime parameters. In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed method exhibits robustness against the misspecification of change point numbers and can be augmented with stochastic approximation techniques to effectively mitigate the computational burden. Furthermore, we establish the statistical consistency of the change point location estimation under the Gaussian likelihood assumption. We also generalize the parametric likelihood function using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and propose the semi-parametric TV-HMM that is free of distribution assumptions. A series of experiments validate the theoretical convergence rate and demonstrate our estimation accuracy in terms of Rand index and MSE.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

One of the fundamental tasks in signal processing and time series analysis is identifying and analyzing a complex system with temporal evolution. The states of systems are measured over time by a sequence of observations. Evaluating the locations of abrupt distributional changes within the sequence is commonly known as the Change Point Detection (CPD) problem. Practically, many applications require solving the CPD problem, where the proposed methods are helpful for subsequent analysis of the sequence characteristics, such as gait analysis (Lee & Grimson, 2002), anomaly detection (Liu et al., 2018), biological diagnostics (Gardner et al., 2006), financial analysis (Andreou & Ghysels, 2002), and more.

In this paper, we focus on offline change point detection methods (Truong et al., 2020), which analyze and operate the complete dataset retrospectively. Compared to the online CPD methods (Adams & MacKay, 2007; Chang et al., 2019), these methods are better suited for complex modeling and they have access to the entire observations, which enables higher detection accuracy and a more comprehensive understanding of the overall patterns, trends, and characteristics of the regimes between the adjacent change points.

There is rich literature related to the offline change point detection problem. The early work can be traced back to the 1950s, which focuses on detecting the mean value changes of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian random variables (Page, 1955). From the methodology perspective, Pein et al. (2017) detects change points based on ubiquitous maximum likelihood estimation. With the piecewise linear model assumption, Bai & Perron (1998) minimizes the squared and absolute cost function on the observed sequence and the parameters. Harchaoui & Cappé (2007)

detect the change point by minimizing the kernel distance of observations in reproducing kernel Hilbert space while Zou et al. (2014) uses the empirical distribution divergence measurement. When it comes to the Bayesian approaches, Barry & Hartigan (1993); Park & Dunson (2010); Müller et al. (2011) develop the product partition model(PPM) for offline CPD, and Chib (1998) introduces a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and determines the latent change point state by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Pesaran et al. (2006) introduces a hierarchical structure on HMM where parameters follow certain common meta-distributions. Assuming regime durations have a Poisson distribution, Koop & Potter (2007) develops a time-varying parameter model with hierarchical prior distributions to detect change points. Additionally, Ko et al. (2015) combines the Dirichlet process with HMM to estimate the latent state without prior specification of the number of states. The comprehensive review of offline change point methods can be found in (Truong et al., 2020).

However, the effectiveness of these methods can be influenced by various hyper-parameters, e.g., the number of change points, significance level, or penalty coefficients. Killick et al. (2012) adapts the CPD algorithm with a linear penalty on the number of change points. Determining the optimal values for these parameters may require specialized knowledge or additional evaluation criteria (Burnham & Anderson, 2004). Although some non-parametric Bayesian models (Ko et al., 2015; Peluso et al., 2019) do not require a predetermined number of change points, they often involve computationally intensive processes, such as MCMC sampling, to obtain posterior distributions for the entire dataset. Furthermore, previous studies on Bayesian CPD have mainly focused on algorithmic design and lack strong theoretical guarantees. The convergence rate and performance of these methods may vary depending on the specific problem and settings. Additionally, many CPD methods rely on parametric distributions, often assuming each observation to be normally distributed in order to detect changes in mean and variance. While these assumptions offer advantages in terms of interpretability and inference efficiency, it is still preferable to have a CPD method that is not limited by the likelihood assumption, as it would be more robust against model misspecification and outliers. Therefore, these limitations make these methods less practical for real-world applications and datasets.

In order to overcome the challenges of hyperparameter selection and computational burden, we propose the Time-Varying Hidden Markov Model (TV-HMM). Concisely, our contributions are as follows:

1) TV-HMM models the locations of change points with the time-varying Markov chain. Its transition matrix takes into account the size of the sequence length, encompassing all possible locations. The adaptive updating of the transition matrix for each change point allows for more efficient change point detection without prior knowledge of the number of change points.  
2) We develop a variational EM algorithm that can endogenously determine the necessary number of change points from the observed data. The algorithm leverages stochastic approximation by chronologically sampling an observation subset. This reduces the computational cost compared to MCMC-based inference. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the statistical consistency of our method in detecting change point locations.  
3) To validate our theoretical results, we conduct numerical experiments and evaluate the performance of our proposed method on both simulated and real-world data. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.  
4) We extend the parametric method to the semi-parametric TV-HMM that alleviates the assumption on parametric distribution by using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for likelihood measurement. We introduce a new learning objective, MMD-ELBO, and train the model through re-parameterization trick (Kingma et al., 2015). Our experiments show promising performance on non-Gaussian datasets without incorporating distributional knowledge.

# 2 TIME-VARYING HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL AND LOCATION TRANSITION

Given the observed  $D$ -dimensional sequence  $\mathbf{Y} = \{y_1, \ldots, y_N\}$  with  $y_n \in \mathbb{R}^D$ , our goal is to detect all  $K$  change points  $\{\tau_k\}_{k=1}^K$ , with each  $\tau_k \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$  and estimate the distribution of each regime. There are extensive works with different settings of CPD, such as piecewise i.i.d assumption (Matteson & James, 2014; Li et al., 2015), autoregressive assumption (Yamanishi & Takeuchi, 2002), and others (Kawahara et al., 2007). In this work, we illustrate our method using

the common piecewise i.i.d setting, such that  $y_{n}$  is independently sampled from a distribution  $\mathcal{P}_k$  for  $\tau_{k - 1}\leq n\leq \tau_k$ , with  $\tau_0 = 1$  and  $\tau_{K + 1} = N$ .

# 2.1 TIME-VARYING HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL: A PARAMETRIC CASE

We encode the change point location by a one-hot random variable  $\mathbf{t}_k\in \mathbb{R}^N$ . Since the  $k$ -th change point should be always no earlier than the  $k - 1$ -th, the stochastic process  $\{\mathbf{t}_1,\dots,\mathbf{t}_K\}$  is a left-to-right Markov chain with a upper triangular transition matrix. Denoting  $\mathbf{t}_k(i)$  as the  $i$ -th element of the vector, the joint distribution of  $\{\mathbf{t}_1,\dots,\mathbf{t}_K\}$  as well as the transition probability matrix between  $\mathbf{t}_{k - 1}$  and  $\mathbf{t}_k$  are given by:

$$
\begin{array}{l} p (\mathbf {t} _ {1}; \Pi_ {1}) p (\mathbf {t} _ {2} | \mathbf {t} _ {1}; \Pi_ {2}) \ldots p (\mathbf {t} _ {K} | \mathbf {t} _ {K - 1}; \Pi_ {K}) = \prod_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \pi_ {1, n} ^ {\mathbf {t} _ {1} (n)} \prod_ {k = 2} ^ {K} \left[ \prod_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \prod_ {m = 1} ^ {N} \pi_ {k, n, m} ^ {\mathbf {t} _ {k} (n) \times \mathbf {t} _ {k - 1} (m)} \right], \\ \text {w i t h} \Pi_ {k} := \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} \pi_ {k, 1, 1} & \pi_ {k, 1, 2} & \dots & \pi_ {k, 1, N - 1} & \pi_ {k, 1, N} \\ 0 & \pi_ {k, 2, 2} & \dots & \pi_ {k, 2, N - 1} & \pi_ {k, 2, N} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & \pi_ {k, N - 1, N - 1} & \pi_ {k, N - 1, N} \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \pi_ {k, N, N} \end{array} \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

where each element  $\pi_{k,i,j}$  represents the prior probability coefficient that  $k$ -th regime starts at time step  $i$  and ends at  $j$ . Note that the previous hidden Markov models (Chib, 1998; Ko et al., 2015) consider a restricted transition matrix whose size is proportional to the state number  $K$ . The Markov chain in these methods experiences  $N$ -step transitions along the sequence. On the other hand, our modeling scheme allows the transition probability matrix  $\Pi_k$  to evolve over time and only computes  $K$ -step transitions to improve the inference efficiency.

Under the parametric case, the distribution shift between the adjacent regimes is reduced to the change of parameter values. We treat the regime parameters  $(\theta_{1},\ldots ,\theta_{K + 1})$  as random variables and introduce  $K + 1$  prior distributions  $\{p(\theta_k;\alpha_k)\}_{k = 1}^{K + 1}$ , where  $\alpha_{k}$  denotes all hyperparameters for  $k$ -th regime. For illustration purposes, we consider the Gaussian likelihood case with mean and precision, where  $\theta_{k} = \{u_{k},\Lambda_{k}\}$  and the conjugate normal-Wishart prior. Given the location indicators  $(\mathbf{t}_k,\mathbf{t}_{k - 1})$ , the random variable  $\mathbf{Y}_k$  represents the observations set within the corresponding regime. Under the piecewise i.i.d assumption, the likelihood of the  $k$ -th regime and prior distributions is given by:

$$
\begin{array}{l} p \left(\mathbf {Y} _ {k} \mid \mathbf {t} _ {k}, \mathbf {t} _ {k - 1}, \theta_ {k}\right) = \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \prod_ {j = i} ^ {N} \left[ \prod_ {t = j} ^ {i} \mathcal {N} \left(y _ {t} \mid u _ {k}, \Lambda_ {k}\right) \right] ^ {\mathbf {t} _ {k - 1} (i) \times \mathbf {t} _ {k} (j)} \tag {1} \\ u _ {k} \sim \mathcal {N} (0, \beta^ {- 1} \mathbf {I}), \quad \Lambda_ {k} \sim \mathcal {W} (v _ {0}, V _ {0}), \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathcal{W}(\cdot)$  denotes the Wishart distribution. In our model specification,  $\pi_{k,i,j}$  can be learned directly from data by optimizing with respect to marginal data likelihood. This probability reflects the relevance of time interval  $[i,j]$  with the true regime  $[\tau_k,\tau_{k - 1}]$ . A similar idea has been applied in the hyperparameters learning of Gaussian process (Rasmussen et al., 2006). In our model, since practically the value of  $K$  is unknown, automatic model selection can be performed by learning these probabilities for each  $\mathbf{t}_k$ . If the corresponding diagonal elements  $\pi_{k,i,i}$  converge to 1, indicating the time length of  $k$ -th regime is zero, then the unnecessary change points can be removed from the model specification. In Section 3.1, we visualize the value of converged  $\Pi_k$  from numerical simulations and illustrate all significant spots concentrating on the true locations and the diagonal.

# 2.2 INFERENCE VIA VARIATIONAL EM ALGORITHM

Denoting the set of all latent variables as  $\pmb{\xi} = \{\{\mathbf{t}_k\}_{k=1}^K, \{\theta_k\}_{k=1}^{K+1}\}$ , TV-HMM detects the locations and number of change points by inferring the posterior distribution of  $\pmb{\xi}$  and learning the transition probability  $\Pi_k$ . In the Bayesian literature, Neal (2012) introduces the automatic relevance determination (ARD) procedure for neural network learning. The idea is that optimizing the continuous hyperparameters with respect to marginal log-likelihood provably leads to consistent model selection and obeys Occam's razor phenomenon (Ghosal et al., 2008; Yang & Pati, 2017). However,

direct marginal likelihood maximization is intractable since it involves the integral over all latent variables. EM algorithm provides a solution where we relax the marginal likelihood function with its lower bound. Denoting the hyperparameters set  $\Pi = \{\Pi_k\}_{k=1}^K$  and  $\alpha = \{\alpha_k\}_{k=1}^{K+1}$ , we have

$$
\text {E - S t e p .} \mathcal {L} (\Pi | \Pi^ {o l d}) = \mathrm {E} _ {\boldsymbol {\xi} | \mathbf {Y}; \Pi^ {o l d}, \boldsymbol {\alpha}} [ \log p (\mathbf {Y}, \boldsymbol {\xi}; \Pi , \boldsymbol {\alpha}) ],
$$

$$
\mathbf {M} \text {- S t e p .} \hat {\boldsymbol {\Pi}} = \underset {\boldsymbol {\Pi}} {\arg \max } \mathcal {L} \left(\boldsymbol {\Pi} \mid \boldsymbol {\Pi} ^ {o l d}\right).
$$

Although the EM algorithm seems feasible, the E-Step requires evaluating the true posterior  $p(\pmb{\xi} \mid \mathbf{Y}; \pmb{\Pi}, \pmb{\alpha})$ , which has no analytical form. Here we further leverage variational approximation and introduce a tractable variational distribution  $Q$  as an approximator of the true posterior under KL divergence. By maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we minimize the KL divergence between  $Q$  and the true posterior distribution (Blei et al., 2017). Under common mean-field assumption where variational distributions can be independently factorized, we can obtain explicit solutions of optimal approximator  $Q^{*}$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q ^ {*} \left(\theta_ {k}\right) \propto \exp \left(\operatorname {E} _ {Q \left(\mathbf {t} _ {k}, \mathbf {t} _ {k - 1}\right)} \left[ \log p \left(\mathbf {Y} _ {k}, \mathbf {t} _ {k}, \theta_ {k} \mid \mathbf {t} _ {k - 1}; \alpha_ {k}, \Pi_ {k}\right) \right]\right), \\ Q ^ {*} \left(\mathbf {t} _ {1}, \dots , \mathbf {t} _ {K}\right) \propto \prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K + 1} \exp \left(\mathrm {E} _ {Q \left(\theta_ {k}\right)} \ln p \left(\mathbf {Y} _ {k}, \mathbf {t} _ {k}, \theta_ {k} \mid \mathbf {t} _ {k - 1}; \Pi_ {k}, \alpha_ {k}\right)\right). \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Noted that the solution in Equation 2 is a joint distribution of  $\{\mathbf{t}_1,\dots ,\mathbf{t}_K\}$ . However, the primary interest of location detection is marginal distributions  $Q(\mathbf{t}_k)$ , and  $Q(\mathbf{t}_k,\mathbf{t}_{k - 1})$  for  $Q^{*}(\theta_{k})$  inference. To obtain these quantities, we propose a recursive message-passing procedure based on the sum-product algorithm. The marginalization is achieved by passing real-valued message functions between the latent variables  $\mathbf{t}_k$ , which are denoted by:  $\mu_{\rightarrow \mathbf{t}_k},\mu_{\mathbf{t}_k\leftarrow}\in \mathbb{R}^N$ . These two functions represent the information flow that propagates front and back from subsequent variables:

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q \left(\mathbf {t} _ {k} (n) = 1\right) \propto \mu_ {\rightarrow \mathbf {t} _ {k}} (n) \cdot \mu_ {t _ {k} \leftarrow} (n), \quad Q (\mathbf {t} _ {k - 1} (m) = 1, \mathbf {t} _ {k} (n) = 1) \propto \\ \mu_ {\rightarrow \mathbf {t} _ {k - 1}} (m) \cdot \pi_ {i, m, n} \cdot \exp \left(\operatorname {E} _ {Q (\theta_ {k})} \ln p (\mathbf {Y} _ {k}, \mathbf {t} _ {k}, \theta_ {k} \mid \mathbf {t} _ {k - 1}; \Pi_ {k}, \alpha_ {k})\right) \cdot \mu_ {t _ {k} \leftarrow} (n), \\ \end{array}
$$

where the recursive formula of message passing is given by:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mu_ {\rightarrow \mathbf {t} _ {k}} (n) = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {n} \left\{\mu_ {\rightarrow \mathbf {t} _ {i - 1}} (m) \cdot \pi_ {k, m, n} \cdot \exp \left[ \mathrm {E} _ {Q (\theta_ {k})} \ln p (\mathbf {Y} _ {k} \mid \theta_ {k}, \mathbf {t} _ {k} (n) = 1, \mathbf {t} _ {k - 1} (m) = 1) \right]\right\}, \\ \mu_ {\mathbf {t} _ {k - 1} \leftarrow} (m) = \sum_ {n = m} ^ {N} \left\{\mu_ {\mathbf {t} _ {k} \leftarrow} (n) \cdot \pi_ {k, m, n} \cdot \exp \left[ \mathrm {E} _ {Q \left(\theta_ {k}\right)} \ln p \left(\mathbf {Y} _ {k} \mid \theta_ {k}, \mathbf {t} _ {k - 1} (m) = 1, \mathbf {t} _ {k} (n) = 1\right) \right] \right\}. \tag {3} \\ \end{array}
$$

Given the initial  $\mu_{\rightarrow \mathbf{t}_1}$  and  $\mu_{\mathbf{t}_K\leftarrow}$ , each message flow can be iteratively evaluated. For the Gaussian example of Equation 1, the detailed expressions of Equation 2 and 3 are given in the Appendix B. After updating all variational distributions by taking one-step coordinate gradient ascent, we optimize hyperparameters  $\Pi$  in M-step. By alternating between E and M steps, we simultaneously detect the change point locations and estimate the parameters of each regime using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) of variational distributions:

$$
\hat {\tau} _ {k} = \underset {\tau_ {k}} {\arg \max } Q \left(\mathbf {t} _ {k} (\tau_ {k}) = 1\right), \quad \hat {\theta} _ {k} = \underset {\theta_ {k}} {\arg \max } Q \left(\theta_ {k}\right).
$$

The computation complexity of each iteration is  $\mathcal{O}(KN^2)$ . When the length of the sequence grows, the convergence speed and memory usage become inhibited. To relieve the computational burden, we randomly sample a subset of observations chronologically in each iteration. The subset has a fixed length  $S$ , which is much smaller than the number of observations  $S \ll N$ . A local estimator with this subset is established under stochastic approximation that enjoys less computational complexity and guarantees convergence to global optimal (Robbins & Monro, 1951). In our simulations, the proposed procedure usually converges or reaches the predefined iteration limit within 30 iterations. Thus, we successfully reduce the computational cost of each EM step to  $\mathcal{O}(KS^2)$  and improve the computational efficiency. The complete procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1.

Practically, the unknown prior knowledge of  $K$  could be learned from data using 'ARD'. If we initialize our method using a Markov chain  $[\mathbf{t}_1, \dots, \mathbf{t}_{\tilde{K}}]$  with  $\tilde{K} > K$ . As the algorithm progresses, the learned transition matrix  $\Pi$  reveals the probability of each location transition, and the estimated locations  $\{\hat{\tau}_k\}_{k=1}^{\tilde{K}}$  are clustered together. Some of the successive change points will gradually converge to the same location, e.g.,  $\hat{\tau}_{L_1} = \hat{\tau}_{L_1 + 1} = \dots = \hat{\tau}_{L_1 + l}$  for some integer  $l$ . Therefore, the redundant regimes will vanish during the EM iteration and there are only  $K$  unique locations remaining after convergence.

# 2.3 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

In this section, we provide a statistical analysis of how TV-HMM estimates the change point locations and numbers. We list the necessary notations and assumptions under which our theoretical result is established:

A1: For fixed constants  $T, K, D$ , the underlying sequence on time interval  $[0, T]$  consists of  $K$  change points  $0 < T_1 < \ldots < T_K < T_{K+1} = T$  and the random function  $y(t): \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^D$  represents the sample drawn from  $\mathcal{N}(y \mid u_k, \Lambda_k)$  if  $T_{k-1} < t < T_k$ .

A2: For any time interval  $[m, n] \subseteq [0, T]$ , the number of observations within this interval equals  $\mathcal{O}(N^{\frac{n - m}{T}})$ .

A3: The algorithm initializes  $\tilde{K} = M_{K + 1} - 1$  change points. Each corresponds to an equal-distance segment  $[t_{i - 1}, t_i]$ , such that  $t_{i + 1} - t_i = \frac{T}{M_{K + 1}}$ . We can further categorize  $\{\mathbf{t}_i\}_{i = 1}^{M_{K + 1} - 1}$  into two subsets:

- Any  $\mathbf{t}_i$  with  $i \in \{M_1, \dots, M_K\}$  denotes the junction points, e.g. there is a true change point located within the interval  $[t_{i-1}, t_i]$  and  $\mathrm{y}(t)$  within the interval does not identically distribute.  
- For  $k = 1, \dots, K + 1$ , any  $\mathbf{t}_i$  with  $i \in \{M_{k - 1} + 1, \dots, M_k - 1\}$  denotes the non-junction index, such that every  $y(t)$  within the interval comes from the same distribution.

Then we can show our method leads to a provable selection consistency of change point locations:

Theorem 1 (Location Consistency). Assuming assumption A1-A3 hold, the marginal probability  $Q(\mathbf{t}_i(n) = 1)$  consistently estimates the location of the change point with the maximum exponential rate of  $N$ :

- For non-junction points  $\mathbf{t}_i$  with  $i\in \{M_{k - 1} + 1,\dots,M_k - 1\}$ :

$$
Q \left(\mathbf {t} _ {i} (n) = 1\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1 & \text {i f} n = T _ {k}; \\ \mathcal {O} (N ^ {- \frac {n - T _ {k}}{T}}) & \text {i f} n \in [ T _ {k - 1}, T _ {k}); \\ \mathcal {O} (\exp (- N ^ {\frac {\min  \left\{| n - T _ {k} | , | n - T _ {k - 1} | \right\}}{T}})) & \text {i f} n \notin [ T _ {k - 1}, T _ {k} ]. \end{array} \right.
$$

- For junction points  $\mathbf{t}_i$  with  $i\in \{M_k\}_{k = 1}^K$ :

$$
Q \left(\mathbf {t} _ {i} (n) = 1\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1 & \text {i f} n = T _ {k}; \\ \mathcal {O} (\exp (- N ^ {\frac {| n - T _ {k} |}{T}})) & \text {o t h e r w i s e}. \end{array} \right.
$$

Remark. The assumption A3 guarantees that each  $Q(\theta_k)$  is initialized using the characteristic (e.g. mean and variance for the Gaussian case) of equal distance segments  $[t_{k - 1}, t_k]$ , which is depicted with a box in Figure 1. Then Theorem 1 indicates these segments determine convergence rates of probabilities  $Q(\mathbf{t}_k)$ , e.g. if the segment contains a true change point  $T_k$ ,  $\mathbf{t}_k$  is a junction point and its  $Q(\mathbf{t}_k(n))$  would converge to 1 for  $n = T_k$  at the exponential rate of  $N$ . On the other hand, non-junction points whose initial segments are identically distributed with the true regime will also converge at the rate up to the exponential of  $N$ . Thus, as  $N \to \infty$ , the MAP estimations of  $\{\hat{\tau}_k\}_{k=1}^{M_{K+1}-1}$  become an unduplicated set

$\{T_k\}_{k = 1}^K$  and can drop those segments whose length are 0.

# 3 SYNTHESIS DATA ANALYSIS

In this section, we evaluate our method on various simulations and real data. We first conduct numerical experiments to provide evidence for our theoretical result. Then we compare the performance of TV-HMM with that of other offline CPD methods in both simulated data and the real-world application. These results show the effectiveness and robustness of our method in terms of location detection and parameter estimation. Throughout the experiments, we evenly divide the sequence into  $\tilde{K}$  segments to fulfill A3 in Section 2.3. The details about initialization and hyperparameters setting are included in the Appendix D.1

# 3.1 IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THEOREM 1

To analyze the theoretical results with controlled experiments, we consider a normal mean-variance shift model, which is also studied in (Yamanishi & Takeuchi, 2002; Matteson & James, 2014). The performance of CPD is measured by mean absolute error (MAE). For true change point location  $\{l_1, l_2, \ldots\}$  and estimated  $\{\hat{l}_1, \hat{l}_2, \ldots\}$ , MAE =  $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j} \min_i |\hat{l}_j - l_i|$ , which measures the sum of absolute distances of each estimated location with its closest true location.

We first investigate the change of convergence rate by varying the value of  $N$  and the results are summarized in Figure 2. The top left plot (a) shows the small value of  $N$  results in fluctuations of the estimated number of change points; as the size of observations increases, the estimated number remains steady at the true value 4. Similarly, the performance of parameters estimation is in the bottom left plot (b), indicating the estimation error rapidly decreases as the length of sequences grows. All the results are repeated for 100 times with fixed initialization across all the cases and are consistent with Theorem 1. Thus, the convergence rate of the TV-HMM increases with the size of observations.

To illustrate the results of automatic relevance determination, we also visualize the  $\pi_{k,i,j}$  before and after convergence, by taking the summation of  $\{\Pi_k\}_{k = 1}^K$ . Results are shown on the right of Figure 2. The top right plot (c) shows the initial upper triangular transition matrix and the bottom plot (d) is the converged result from Algorithm 1. Note that the converged transition matrix is extremely sparse. Those non-zero spots on the diagonal indicate the existence of unnecessary regimes with size 0. Other significant spots are near true change point locations, indicating the high relevance of these intervals with respect to the true regime. Then we infer the  $\{Q(\mathbf{t}_k)\}_{k = 1}^K$  for automatic model selection by leveraging the converged  $\{\Pi_k\}_{k = 1}^K$  as prior distributions.

# 3.2 EVALUATION ON SIMULATED DATA

Effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by comparison with several well-developed CPD methods, including WBSLSW (Korkas & PryzlewiczV, 2017), ECP3O (Zhang et al., 2017), KCP (Harchaoui & Cappé, 2007),  $\mathcal{D}_m$ -BOCD (Altamirano et al., 2023) and another HMM-based method, DPHMM (Ko et al., 2015). The performance of CPD is measured by the Rand index, which is the similarity between two different data partitions (Lajugie et al., 2014; Fleming et al., 2023). It produces a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement.

We consider three change-point models for the simulation, each with a significant characteristic. (Matteson & James, 2014; Chang et al., 2019). For Model 1, each regime follows either a binomial, Poisson, or normal distribution, with corresponding parameter variations. For Model 2, sequences are generated from 5-dimensional normal distributions, with either mean or covariance matrix shifts, and Model 3 increases the dimension to 10. Our simulations cover all common regime shifts in the piecewise i.i.d setting. For more details about the simulation setups, please refer to Appendix D.3.

Table 1 shows the performance of all methods for all cases. For Model 1, the accuracy of our methods is in line with DPHMM and outperforms the other four methods. Our method is the best among all candidate methods in Model 2. For Model 3, our method is also comparable to the best method ECP3O. The results indicate that our method performs consistently across all three models while existing methods suffer from fluctuation in per

The proposed TV-HMM is able to simultaneously estimate the characteristics of each estimated regime, which is the mean and precision for Equation 1. We test the proposed method under different data dimensions. The parameter estimation is measured by the Mean Squared Error(MSE). We summarize the results in Table 2. Our method provides promising estimation results since the MSE of the estimated posterior mean  $(\hat{u})$  and ground truth  $(u)$  falls within the range of 0.1 to 0.2 in all cases. For the posterior precision  $(\hat{\Lambda})$  estimation, MSE is relatively larger than the other cases, which is reasonable since the number of parameters grows substantially with dimension  $D$ . Furthermore, the small standard deviation (SD) of MSE indicates the stability of our estimation across all setups.

# 3.3 EVALUATION ON REAL-WORLD DATASET

Robustness of our method is evaluated on the Well-log dataset from the real-world application. The data contains 4050 nuclear magnetic resonance measurements during the drilling procedures (Ruanaidh & Fitzgerald, 2012). Note that this sequence is corrupted by outliers, which have a significant effect on change point detection. To tackle this problem, Altamirano et al. (2023) develop the  $\mathcal{D}_m$ -BOCD that is incorporated with diffusion score matching, to reduce the effect of outliers on change point detection. This adaptation allows  $\mathcal{D}_m$ -BOCD to work on the corrupted dataset. Therefore, we compare the estimated locations of TV-HMM with their results, and the comparison is shown in Figure 3. The detected regime is separately colored, indicating the existence of a distributional shift. Most of the outliers are not identified as change points, and the results of TV-HMM are essentially in line with that in (Altamirano et al., 2023), which are plotted in a color bar at the bottom. The grey band indicates the mismatch of detected regimes. There is a clear change point at the time stamp 1540 that is not identifiable using  $\mathcal{D}_m$ -BOCD. Therefore, our method exhibits a comparative advantage on the Well-log dataset and demonstrates robustness to outliers.

Figure 3: Estimated change point locations of Well-log data, color band (1) represents estimated regimes from TV-HMM, (2) represents estimated regimes from  $\mathcal{D}_m - \mathrm{BOCD}$ . The grey bands represent the mismatches between the two methods.

# 4 EXTENSION OF TV-HMM WITH MAXIMUM MEAN DISCREPANCY

Previous results are developed based on the parametric likelihood function. Here, we alleviate the assumption using the kernel approach and propose a semi-supervised TV-HMM that is robust against outliers and model misspecification. Our motivation is that the expected log-likelihood term in the message function can be regarded as a distance measure between the observations subset  $\mathbf{Y}_k$  and the characteristics of  $k$ -th regime  $\zeta_k$ . Thus, we can generalize the message functions of Equation 3 using Maximum mean discrepancy(MMD):

$$
\mu_ {\rightarrow \mathbf {t} _ {k}} (n) = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {n} \left\{\mu_ {\rightarrow \mathbf {t} _ {i - 1}} (m) \cdot \pi_ {k, m, n} \cdot \exp \left[ - \frac {n - m + 1}{G} \left\| \mathbb {E} _ {\hat {P} _ {m} ^ {n}} \varphi (y) - \mathbb {E} _ {Q (\zeta_ {k})} \varphi (\zeta_ {k}) \right\| _ {\mathcal {H}} \right]\right\},
$$

$$
\mu_ {\mathbf {t} _ {k - 1} \leftarrow} (m) = \sum_ {n = m} ^ {N} \left\{\mu_ {\mathbf {t} _ {k} \leftarrow} (n) \cdot \pi_ {k, m, n} \cdot \exp \left[ - \frac {n - m + 1}{G} \left\| \mathbb {E} _ {\hat {P} _ {m} ^ {n}} \varphi (y) - \mathbb {E} _ {Q (\zeta_ {k})} \varphi (\zeta_ {k}) \right\| _ {\mathcal {H}} \right] \right\}, \tag {4}
$$

where  $\hat{P}_m^n$  denotes the empirical distribution consisting of  $n - m + 1$  successive observations starting from time index  $m$  to  $n$ , and  $\varphi : \mathbb{R}^D \to \mathcal{H}$  represents the mapping to reproducing kernel Hilbert

space  $\mathcal{H}$ , and  $G$  is a constant that adjusts the value of MMD. Unlike Equation 2 in the parametric model, where  $Q(\theta)$  must be derived using variational inference,  $Q(\zeta)$  can be generally modeled using non-parametric density estimation (Botev et al., 2010) and deep generative models (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014)]. Denoting the distribution of  $\zeta$  as  $Q_{\Phi}(\zeta)$ , where  $\Phi$  is the model parameters, e.g. the weight values of neural networks, we propose a new MMD-based evidence lower bound (MMD-ELBO) as the objective function for  $\Phi$  learning. The new loss function improves the robustness by replacing the likelihood functions in the original ELBO with a kernel-embedded distance. The formula of MMD-ELBO is given by:

$$
\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K + 1} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {n \geq m} ^ {N} \frac {(m - n - 1) \cdot Q _ {\mathbf {t}} ^ {k} (n , m)}{G} \left\| \mathbb {E} _ {\hat {P} _ {m} ^ {n}} [ \varphi (y) ] - \mathbb {E} _ {Q _ {\Phi} (\zeta_ {k})} [ \varphi (\zeta_ {k}) ] \right\| _ {\mathcal {H}} + \mathrm {K L} (Q _ {\Phi} (\zeta_ {k}) \| p (\zeta_ {k})),
$$

where  $Q_{\mathbf{t}}^{k}(n,m)$  denotes the joint variational probability that  $\mathbf{t}_k(n) = 1$  and  $\mathbf{t}_{k - 1}(m) = 1$  obtained from MMD-based message passing of Equation 4. For each iteration, we can evaluate the value of MMD-ELBO by sampling from  $Q_{\Phi}(\zeta_k)$  and update  $\Phi$  using the re-parameterization trick (Kingma et al., 2015). The pseudo-code of semi-parametric change point detection is summarized in Algorithm 2. We illustrate the performance of semi-parametric TV-HMM through three non-Gaussian examples, where the underlying sequence is generated from Poisson, chi-squared, and exponential distribution, respectively. The setup of the simulations can be found in Appendix D.4. Our performance is promising for all cases in terms of the Rand index, which is 0.9447 for Poisson, 0.8686 for chi-squared, and 0.8911 for exponential distribution. Note that we do not incorporate any distributional knowledge as prior, the results indicate our method has robust performance over a broader class of data distributions.

Relation with Parametric TV-HMM: We illustrate its relation with the previously-discussed parametric TV-HMM. Under the Gaussian assumption with fixed variance, the likelihood  $\mathbb{E}_{Q(\theta_k)}\ln p(\mathbf{Y}_k\mid \theta_k,\mathbf{t}_{k - 1} = m,\mathbf{t}_k = n)$  in previous messenger passing Equation 3 is proportional to:

$$
- \sum_ {i = m} ^ {n} \mathbb {E} _ {u _ {k}} (y _ {i} - u _ {k}) ^ {T} \Lambda_ {k} (y _ {i} - u _ {k}) \propto - (n - m + 1) \cdot \| \sqrt {\Lambda_ {k}} \mathbb {E} _ {\hat {P} _ {m} ^ {n}} [ y ] - \sqrt {\Lambda_ {k}} \mathbb {E} _ {Q (u _ {k})} [ u _ {k} ] \| ^ {2},
$$

which is a special case of MMD with linear mapping  $\varphi (x) = \sqrt{\Lambda_k} x$

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we present TV-HMM, a time-varying Hidden Markov Model that enables simultaneous detection of change points and estimation of regime characteristics. Our method utilizes a variational EM algorithm incorporating stochastic approximation, and we prove its convergence rate for each change point location. Furthermore, we prove that our algorithm consistently selects the true number and locations of change points. Extensive numerical experiments provide evidence for our theoretical results and demonstrate the promising performance of our approach. In cases where the data distributions are unknown, we generalize our method using MMD and propose semiparametric TV-HMM that does not rely on any distributional assumption. However, a limitation of current research is that CPD methods are primarily established on the piecewise i.i.d setting. In the future, we hope to extend our framework to a border class of CPD settings.
