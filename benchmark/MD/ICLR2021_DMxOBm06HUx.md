# ABSTRACT

Pre-trained language models such as BERT have exhibited remarkable performances in many tasks in natural language understanding (NLU). The tokens in the models are usually fine-grained in the sense that for languages like English they are words or sub-words and for languages like Chinese they are characters. In English, for example, there are multi-word expressions which form natural lexical units and thus the use of coarse-grained tokenization also appears to be reasonable. In fact, both fine-grained and coarse-grained tokenizations have advantages and disadvantages for learning of pre-trained language models. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-trained language model, referred to as AMBERT (A Multi-grained BERT), on the basis of both fine-grained and coarse-grained tokenizations. For English, AMBERT takes both the sequence of words (fine-grained tokens) and the sequence of phrases (coarse-grained tokens) as input after tokenization, employs one encoder for processing the sequence of words and the other encoder for processing the sequence of the phrases, utilizes shared parameters between the two encoders, and finally creates a sequence of contextualized representations of the words and a sequence of contextualized representations of the phrases. Experiments have been conducted on benchmark datasets for Chinese and English, including CLUE, GLUE, SQuAD and RACE. The results show that AMBERT outperforms the existing best performing models in almost all cases, particularly the improvements are significant for Chinese.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT (Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Lan et al., 2019) have shown great power in natural language understanding (NLU). The Transformer-based language models are first learned from a large corpus in pre-training, and then learned from labeled data of a downstream task in fine-tuning. With Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), pre-training technique, and big data, the models can effectively capture the lexical, syntactic, and semantic relations between the tokens in the input text and achieve the state-of-the-art performances in many NLU tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text entailment, and machine reading comprehension.

In BERT, for example, pre-training is mainly conducted based on mask language modeling (MLM) in which about  $15\%$  of the tokens in the input text are masked with a special token [MASK], and the goal is to reconstruct the original text from the masked text. Fine-tuning is separately performed for individual tasks as text classification, text matching, text span detection, etc. Usually, the tokens in the input text are fine-grained; for example, they are words or sub-words in English and characters in Chinese. In principle, the tokens can also be coarse-grained, that is, for example, phrases in English and words in Chinese. There are many multi-word expressions in English such as 'New York' and 'ice cream' and the use of phrases also appears to be reasonable. It is more sensible to use words (including single character words) in Chinese, because they are basic lexical units. In fact, all existing pre-trained language models employ single-grained (usually fine-grained) tokenization.

Previous work indicates that the fine-grained approach and the coarse-grained approach have both pros and cons. The tokens in the fine-grained approach are less complete as lexical units but their representations are easier to learn (because there are less token types and more tokens in training data), while the tokens in the coarse-grained approach are more complete as lexical units but their representations are more difficult to learn (because there are more token types and less tokens in training data). Moreover, for the coarse-grained approach there is no guarantee that tokenization

(segmentation) is completely correct. Sometimes ambiguity exists and it would be better to retain all possibilities of tokenization. In contrast, for the fine-grained approach tokenization is carried out at the primitive level and there is no risk of 'incorrect' tokenization.

For example, Li et al. (2019) observe that fine-grained models consistently outperform coarse-grained models in deep learning for Chinese language processing. They point out that the reason is that low frequency words (coarse-grained tokens) tend to have insufficient training data and tend to be out of vocabulary, and as a result the learned representations are not sufficiently reliable. On the other hand, previous work also demonstrates that masking of coarse-grained tokens in pre-training of language models is helpful (Cui et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2020). That is, although the model itself is fine-grained, masking on consecutive tokens (phrases in English and words in Chinese) can lead to learning of a more accurate model. In Appendix A, we give examples of attention maps in BERT to further support the assertion.

In this paper, we propose A Multi-grained BERT model (AMBERT), which employs both fine-grained and coarse-grained tokenizations. For English, AMBERT extends BERT by simultaneously constructing representations for both words and phrases in the input text using two encoders. Specifically, AMBERT first conducts tokenization at both word and phrase levels. It then takes the embeddings of words and phrases as input to the two encoders. It utilizes the same parameters across the two encoders. Finally it obtains a contextualized representation for the word and a contextualized representation for the phrase at each position. Note that the number of parameters in AMBERT is comparable to that in BERT because of the parameter sharing. AMBERT can represent the input text at both word-level and phrase-level, to leverage the advantages of the two approaches of tokenization, and create richer representations for the input text at multiple granularity.

We conduct extensive experiments to make comparison between AMBERT and the baselines as well as alternatives to AMBERT, using the benchmark datasets in English and Chinese. The results show that AMBERT significantly outperforms single-grained BERT models with a large margin in both Chinese and English. In English, compared to Google BERT, AMBERT achieves  $2.0\%$  higher GLUE score,  $2.5\%$  higher RACE score, and  $5.1\%$  more SQuAD score. In Chinese, AMBERT improves average score by over  $2.7\%$  in CLUE. AMBERT can beat all the base models at the leader board of CLUE, whose parameters are less than 200M.

We make the following contributions in this work.

- Study of multi-grained pre-trained language models,  
- Proposal of a new pre-trained language model called AMBERT as extension of BERT, which makes use of multi-grained tokens and shared parameters,  
- Empirical verification of AMBERT on the English and Chinese benchmark datasets GLUE, SQuAD, RACE, and CLUE.

# 2 RELATED WORK

There has been a large amount of work on pre-trained language models. ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) is one of the first pre-trained language models for learning of contextualized representations of words in the input text. Leveraging the power of Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), GPTs (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) are developed as unidirectional models to make prediction on the input text in an autoregressive manner, and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is developed as a bidirectional model to make prediction on the whole or part of the input text. Mask language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) are the two tasks in pre-training of BERT. Since the inception of BERT, a number of new models have been proposed to further enhance the performance of it. XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) is a permutation language model which can improve the accuracy of MLM. RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) represents a new way of training more reliable BERT with a very large amount of data. ALBERT (Lan et al., 2019) is a light-weight version of BERT, which shares parameters across layers. StructBERT (Wang et al., 2019) incorporates word and sentence structures into BERT for learning of better representations of tokens and sentences. ERNIE2.0 (Sun et al., 2020) is a variant of BERT pre-trained in multiple tasks with coarse-grained tokens masked. ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) has a GAN-style architecture for efficiently utilizing all tokens in pre-training.

It has been found that the use of coarse-grained tokens is beneficial for pre-trained language models. Devlin et al. (2018) point out that 'whole word masking' is effective for training of BERT. It is also observed that whole word masking is useful for building a Chinese BERT (Cui et al., 2019). In

ERNIE (Sun et al., 2019b), entity level masking is employed as a strategy for pre-training and proved to be effective for language understanding tasks (see also (Zhang et al., 2019)). In SpanBERT (Joshi et al., 2020), text spans are masked in pre-training and the learned model can substantially enhance the accuracies of span selection tasks. It is indicated that word segmentation is especially important for Chinese and a BERT-based Chinese text encoder is proposed with n-gram representations (Diao et al., 2019). All existing work focuses on the use of single-grained tokens in learning and utilization of pre-trained language models. In this work, we propose a general technique of exploiting multi-grained tokens for pre-trained language models and apply it to BERT.

# 3 OUR METHOD: AMBERT

In this section, we present the model, pre-training, and fine-tuning of AMBERT. We also make a discussion on alternatives of AMBERT.

# 3.1 MODEL

Figure 1: An overview of AMBERT, showing the process of creating multi-grained representations. The input is a sentence in English and output is the overall representation of the sentence. There are two encoders for processing the sequence of fine-grained tokens and the sequence of coarse-grained tokens respectively. The final contextualized representations of fine-grained tokens and coarse-grained tokens are denoted as  $\boldsymbol{r}_{x0}, \boldsymbol{r}_{x1}, \dots, \boldsymbol{r}_{xm}$  and  $\boldsymbol{r}_{z0}, \boldsymbol{r}_{z1}, \dots, \boldsymbol{r}_{zn}$  respectively.

Figure 1 gives an overview of AMBERT. AMBERT takes a text as input. Tokenization is conducted on the input text to obtain a sequence of fine-grained tokens and a sequence of coarse-grained tokens. AMBERT has two encoders, one for processing the fine-grained token sequence and the other for processing the coarse-grained token sequence. Each of the encoders has exactly the same architecture as that of BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017). The two encoders share the same parameters at each corresponding layer, except that each has its own token embedding parameters. The fine-grained encoder generates contextualized representations from the sequence of fine-grained tokens through its layers. In parallel, the coarse-grained encoder generates contextualized representations from the sequence of coarse-grained tokens through its layers. AMBERT outputs a sequence of contextualized representations for the fine-grained tokens and a sequence of contextualized representations for the coarse-grained tokens.

AMBERT is expressive in that it learns and utilizes contextualized representations of the input text at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. The model retains all possibilities of tokenizations and automatically learns the attention weights (importance) of representations of multi-grained tokens. AMBERT is also efficient through sharing of parameters between the two encoders. The parameters represent the same ways of combining representations, no matter whether representations are those of fine-grained tokens or coarse-grained tokens.

# 3.2 PRE-TRAINING

Pre-training of AMBERT is mainly conducted on the basis of mask language modeling (MLM), at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. (Next sentence prediction (NSP) is not essential as indicated in many studies after BERT (Lan et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). We only use NSP in our experiments for comparison purposes). Let  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$  denote the sequence of fine-grained tokens with some of them being masked, and  $\bar{\mathbf{x}}$  denote the masked fine-grained tokens. Let  $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$  denote the sequence of coarse-grained tokens with some of them being masked, and  $\bar{\mathbf{z}}$  denote the masked coarse-grained tokens. Pre-training is defined as optimization of the following function,

$$
\min  _ {\theta} - \log p _ {\theta} (\bar {\mathbf {x}}, \bar {\mathbf {z}} | \hat {\mathbf {x}}, \hat {\mathbf {z}}) \approx \min  _ {\theta} - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} m _ {i} \log p _ {\theta} (x _ {i} | \hat {\mathbf {x}}) - \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} n _ {j} \log p _ {\theta} (z _ {j} | \hat {\mathbf {z}}), \tag {1}
$$

where  $m_i$  takes 1 or 0 as values and  $m_i = 1$  indicates that fine-grained token  $x_i$  is masked,  $m_j$  denotes the total number of fine-grained tokens;  $n_j$  takes 1 or 0 as values and  $n_j = 1$  indicates that coarse-grained token  $z_j$  is masked,  $n$  denotes the total number of coarse-grained tokens; and  $\theta$  denotes parameters.

# 3.3 FINE-TUNING

In fine-tuning of AMBERT for classification, the fine-grained encoder and coarse-grained encoder create special [CLS] representations, and both representations are used for classification. Fine-tuning is defined as optimization of the following function, which is a regularized loss of multi-task learning, starting from the pre-trained model,

$$
\min  _ {\theta} - \log p _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {y} | \mathbf {x}) = \min  _ {\theta} - \log p _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {y} | \boldsymbol {r} _ {x 0}) - \log p _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {y} | \boldsymbol {r} _ {z 0}) - \log p _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {y} | [ \boldsymbol {r} _ {x 0}, \boldsymbol {r} _ {z 0} ]) + \lambda \| \tilde {\boldsymbol {y}} _ {x} - \tilde {\boldsymbol {y}} _ {z} \| _ {2}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $\mathbf{x}$  is the input text,  $\pmb{y}$  is the classification label,  $r_{x0}$  and  $r_{z0}$  are the [CLS] representations of fine-grained encoder and coarse-grained encoder,  $[a,b]$  denotes concatenation of vectors  $\pmb{a}$  and  $\pmb{b}$ ,  $\lambda$  is coefficient, and  $\|\cdot\|_2$  denotes L2 norm. The last term is based on agreement regularization (Brantley et al., 2019), which forces agreement between the predictions  $(\tilde{\pmb{y}}_x$  and  $\tilde{\pmb{y}}_z)$ .

Similarly, fine-tuning of AMBERT for span detection can be carried out, in which the representations of fine-grained tokens are concatenated with the representations of corresponding coarse-grained tokens. The concatenated representations are then utilized in the task.

# 3.4 ALTERNATIVES

We can consider two alternatives to AMBERT, which also rely on multi-grained tokenization. We refer to them as AMBERT-Combo and AMBERT-Hybrid and make comparisons of them with AMBERT in our experiments.

AMBERT-Combo has two individual encoders, an encoder (BERT) working on the fine-grained token sequence and the other encoder (BERT) working on the coarse-grained token sequence, without parameter sharing between them. In learning and inference AMBERT-Combo simply combines the output layers of the two encoders. Its fine-tuning is similar to that of AMBERT.

AMBERT-Hybrid has only one encoder (BERT) working on both the fine-grained token sequence and the coarse-grained token sequence. It creates representations on the concatenation of two sequences and lets the representations of the two sequences interact with each other at each layer. Its pre-training is formalized in the following function,

$$
\min  _ {\theta} - \log p _ {\theta} (\bar {\mathbf {x}}, \bar {\mathbf {z}} | \hat {\mathbf {x}}, \hat {\mathbf {z}}) \approx \min  _ {\theta} - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} m _ {i} \log p _ {\theta} (x _ {i} | \hat {\mathbf {x}}, \hat {\mathbf {z}}) - \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} n _ {j} \log p _ {\theta} (z _ {j} | \hat {\mathbf {x}}, \hat {\mathbf {z}}), \tag {3}
$$

where the notations are the same as in (1). Its fine-tuning is the same as that of BERT.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We make comparisons between AMBERT and the baselines including fine-grained BERT and coarse-grained BERT, as well as the alternatives including AMBERT-Combo and AMBERT-Hybrid, using benchmark datasets in both Chinese and English. The experiments on the alternatives can also be seen as ablation study on AMBERT.

# 4.1 DATA FOR PRE-TRAINING

For Chinese, we use a corpus consisting of 25 million documents (57G uncompressed text) from Jinri Toutiao<sup>1</sup>. Note that there is no common corpus for training of Chinese BERT. For English, we use a corpus of 13.9 million documents (47G uncompressed text) from Wikipedia and OpenWebText (Gokaslan & Cohen, 2019). Unfortunately, BookCorpus, one of the two corpora in the original paper for English BERT, is no longer publicly available.

The characters in the Chinese texts are naturally taken as fine-grained tokens. We conduct word segmentation on the texts and treat the words as coarse-grained tokens. We employ a word segmentation tool based on a n-gram model. Both tokenizations exploit WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al., 2016). There are 21,128 characters and 72,635 words in the vocabulary of Chinese.

The words in the English texts are naturally taken as fine-grained tokens. We perform coarse-grained tokenization on the English texts in the following way. Specifically, we first calculate the n-grams in the Wikipedia documents using KenLM (Heafield, 2011). We next build a phrase-level dictionary consisting of phrases whose frequencies are sufficiently high and whose last words highly depend on their previous words. We then employ a left-to-right search algorithm to perform phrase-level tokenization on the texts. There are 30,522 words and 77,645 phrases in the vocabulary of English.

# 4.2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

We make use of the same parameter settings for the AMBERT and BERT models. All models in this paper are 'base-models' having 12 layers of encoder. It is too computationally expensive for us to train the models as 'large models' having 24 layers. The hyper-parameters are basically the same as those in the original BERT paper (Devlin et al., 2018), which are given in Appendix C. The optimizer is Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014). To enhance efficiency, we use mix-precision for all the models. Training is carried out on Nvidia V-100. The numbers of GPUs used for training are from 32 to 64, depending on the model sizes.

In pre-training of the AMBERT models, in total  $15\%$  of the coarse-grained tokens are masked, which is the same proportion for the BERT models. To retain consistency, the masked coarse-grained tokens are also masked as fine-grained tokens. In fine-tuning, we use the same hyper-parameters as those in the original papers of the baselines, and all the hyper-parameters are given in Appendix C.

# 4.3 CHINESE TASKS

# 4.3.1 BENCHMARKS

We use the benchmark datasets, Chinese Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE) (Xu et al., 2020) for experiments in Chinese. CLUE contains six classification tasks, that are TNEWS, IFLYTEK and CLUEWSC2020, AFQMC, CSL and CMNLI², and three reading-comprehension tasks which are CMRC2018, ChID and  $C^3$ . The details of all the benchmarks are shown in Appendix B. Data augmentation is also performed for all models in the tasks of TNEWS, CSL and CLUEWSC2020 to achieve better performances (see Appendix D for detailed explanation).

# 4.3.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We compare AMBERT with the BERT baselines, including the BERT model released from Google, referred to as Google BERT, and the BERT model trained by us, referred to as Our BERT, including character based (fine-grained) and word based (coarse-grained) models. Case study in Appendix E.

Table 1 shows the results of the classification tasks. AMBERT improves average scores of the BERT baselines by about  $1.0\%$  and also works better than AMBERT-Combo and AMBERT-Hybrid. The results of Machine Reading Comprehensive (MRC) tasks are shown in Table 2. AMBERT improves average scores of the BERT baselines by over  $3.0\%$ . Our BERT (word) performs poorly in CMRC2018. This is probably because the results of word segmentation are not accurate enough for the task. AMBERT-Combo and AMBERT-Hybrid are on average better than single-grained BERT models. AMBERT further outperforms both of them.

We also compare AMBERT with the state-of-the-art models at the leader board of CLUE<sup>3</sup>. The base models, whose parameters are fewer than 200M, are trained with different datasets and procedures,

Numbers of parameters (param) and time complexities (cmplx) of models are also shown, where  $l$ ,  $n$ , and  $d$  denote layer number, sequence length, and hidden representation size respectively. The tasks with mark  $\dagger$  are those with data augmentation.

and thus the comparisons should only be taken as references. Note that the settings of the base models are the same as that of Xu et al. (2020). Table 3 shows the results. The average score of AMBERT is higher than all the other models. We conclude that multi-grained tokenization is very helpful for pre-trained language models and the design of AMBERT is reasonable.

# 4.4 ENGLISH TASKS

# 4.4.1 BENCHMARKS

The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018) is a collection of nine NLU tasks. Following BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), we exclude the task WNLI for the reason that results of different models on this task are undifferentiated. In addition, three machine reading comprehensive tasks are also included, i.e., SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0, and RACE. The details of English benchmarks can be found in Appendix B.

# 4.4.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We compare AMBERT with the BERT models on the tasks in GLUE. The results of Google BERT are from the original paper (Devlin et al., 2018), and the results of Our BERT are obtained by us. From Table 4 we can see that 1) Multi-grained models particularly AMBERT can achieve better results than single-grained models. 2) Among the multi-grained models, AMBERT performs best with fewer parameters and less computation. Case study is given in Appendix E.

We also make comparison on the SQuAD tasks. The results of Google BERT are either from the papers (Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019) or from our runs with the official code. From Table 5 we make the following conclusions. 1) in SQuAD, AMBERT outperforms Google BERT with a large margin. Our BERT (word) generally performs well and Our BERT (phrase) performs poorly in the span detection tasks. 2) In RACE, AMBERT performs best among all the baselines for both development set and test set. 3) AMBERT is the best multi-grained model.

We compare AMBERT with the state-of-the-art models in both GLUE  $^{4}$  and MRC. The results of baselines, in Table 6, are either reported in published papers or re-implemented by us with Hug-

Table 4: Performance on the tasks in GLUE. Average score over all the tasks is slightly different from the official GLUE score, since we exclude WNLI. CoLA uses Matthew's Corr.

# 4.5 DISCUSSIONS

We further investigate the reason that AMBERT is superior to AMBERT-Combo. Figure 2 shows the distances between the [CLS] representations of the fine-grained encoder and coarse-grained encoder in AMBERT-Combo and AMBERT after pre-training, in terms of cosine dissimilarity (one minus cosine similarity) and normalized Euclidean distance. One can see that the distances in AMBERT-Combo are larger than the distances in AMBERT in the tasks. We perform the assessment using the data in the other tasks and find similar trends. The results indicate that the representations of fine-grained encoder and coarse-grained encoder are closer in AMBERT than in AMBERT-Combo. These are natural consequences of using AMBERT and AMBERT-Combo, whose parameters are respectively shared and unshared across encoders. It implies that the higher performances by AMBERT is due to its parameter sharing, which can use less parameters to learn and represent similar ways of combining tokens no matter whether they are fine-grained or coarse-grained.

We also examine the reasons that AMBERT works better than AMBERT-Hybrid, while both of them exploit multi-grained tokenization. Figure 3 shows the attention weights of first layers in AMBERT and AMBERT-Hybrid, as well as the single-grained BERT models, after pre-training. In AMBERT-Hybrid, the fine-grained tokens attend more to the corresponding coarse-grained tokens and as a result the attention weights among fine-grained tokens are weakened. In contrast, in AMBERT the attention weights among fine-grained tokens and those among coarse-grained tokens are intact. It

appears that attentions among single-grained tokens (fine-grained ones and coarse-grained ones) play important roles in downstream tasks.

To answer the question why the improvements by AMBERT on Chinese are larger than on English in the same pre-training settings, we further make an analysis. We tokenize 10,000 randomly selected Chinese sentences with our Chinese (word) tokenizer. The proportion of words is  $47.0\%$  (157,511 in 335,187), which indicates that about half of the tokens are fine-grained and half are coarse-grained in Chinese. We also tokenize 10,000 randomly selected English sentences with our English (phrase) tokenizer. The proportion of phrases is only  $13.7\%$  (43,661 in 318,985), which means that there are much less coarse-grained tokens than fine-grained tokens in English. Therefore, we postulate that for Chinese it is necessary for a model to process the language at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. AMBERT indeed has the capability.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have proposed a novel pre-trained language model called AMBERT, as an extension of BERT. AMBERT employs multi-grained tokenization, that is, it uses both words and phrases in English and both characters and words in Chinese. With multi-grained tokenization, AMBERT learns in parallel the representations of the fine-grained tokens and the coarse-grained tokens using two encoders with shared parameters. Experimental results have demonstrated that AMBERT significantly outperforms BERT and other models in NLU tasks in both English and Chinese. AMBERT increases average score of Google BERT by about  $2.7\%$  in Chinese benchmark CLUE. AMBERT improves Google BERT by over  $3.0\%$  on a variety of tasks in English benchmarks GLUE, SQuAD (1.1 and 2.0), and RACE.

As future work, we plan to study the following issues: 1) to investigate model acceleration methods in learning of AMBERT, such as sparse attention (Child et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020) and synthetic attention (Tay et al., 2020); 2) to apply the technique of AMBERT into other pre-trained language models such as XLNet; 3) to employ AMBERT in other NLU tasks.
