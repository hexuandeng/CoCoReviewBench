# ABSTRACT

The well-known classical version of the online knapsack problem decides which of the arriving items of different weights and values to accept into a capacity-limited knapsack. In this paper, we consider the online fractional knapsack problem where items can be fractionally accepted. We present the first online algorithms for this problem which incorporate prediction about the input in several forms, including predictions of the smallest value chosen in the optimal offline solution, and interval predictions which give upper and lower bounds on this smallest value. We present algorithms for both of these prediction models, prove their competitive ratios, and give a matching worst-case lower bound. Furthermore, we present a learning-augmented meta-algorithm that combines our prediction techniques with a robust baseline algorithm to simultaneously achieve consistency and robustness. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments that show that our prediction algorithms significantly outperform a simple greedy prediction algorithm for the problem and the robust baseline algorithm, which does not use predictions. Furthermore, we show that our learning-augmented algorithms can leverage imperfect predictions (e.g., from a machine learning model) to greatly improve average-case performance without sacrificing worst-case guarantees.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In the classic online knapsack problem (OKP), the goal is to pack a finite number of sequentially arriving items with different values and weights into a knapsack with a limited capacity such that the total value of admitted items is maximized. In the online setting, the decision-maker should immediately and irrevocably admit or reject an item upon its arrival without knowing the value and weight of the future items. From a practical perspective, OKP captures a broad range of dynamic pricing and resource allocation problems in application domains such as online advertising (Zhou et al., 2008), cloud pricing and job scheduling (Zhang et al., 2017), and admission control and routing in communication networks (Buchbinder & Naor, 2009).

The basic OKP and its variants have been studied in the context of competitive analysis. Under the worst-case analysis, online algorithms are designed to minimize the competitive ratio (Borodin et al., 1992), which is the worst-case ratio of the profits obtained from the offline optimum and the online algorithm. It is well known that no deterministic online algorithms can achieve bounded competitive ratios (Marchetti-Spaccamela & Vercellis, 1995) for the general integral OKP, where items are either fully accepted or rejected. Due to this negative result, existing works mainly approach OKP in three ways: (i) considering a sub-class of knapsack problems, e.g., unit density items (Ma et al., 2019), small weight items (Zhou et al., 2008); (ii) switching to relaxed problem settings, e.g., removable items (Böckenhauer et al., 2020), resource augmentation (Böckenhauer et al., 2014b); and (iii) making additional assumptions on the input, e.g., assuming bounded value-to-weight ratios (Zhou et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2021a; Yang et al., 2021).

In this paper, we focus on an important sub-class of OKP, the online fractional knapsack problem (OFKP), where an algorithm can accept any fraction of an item. In practice, OFKP models significant real-world applications in dynamic resource allocation scenarios where each item (i.e., request) can be arbitrarily divided. Noted applications of OFKP include distributing online sequential tasks with different computational requirements to available resources efficiently Liu et al. (2011), routing varied-rate traffic through a network concerning capacity constraints Cao et al. (2022), and scheduling energy in smart grids Sun et al. (2021b).

From a theoretical perspective, fractional knapsack is well understood in the offline setting (Ishii et al., 1977; Ferdosian et al., 2015), (where a greedy algorithm solves the problem optimally), but it remains relatively understudied in the online setting. The most recent result by (Sun et al., 2021b) shows that if we additionally assume that the unit values of all items are bounded within  $[L,U]$ , a threshold-based algorithm for OFKP can achieve the optimal competitive ratio of  $O(\ln(U / L))$  (see Section 2.2 for more detail). However, the bound on the unit values often gives rather coarse uncertainty quantification for the instances of OFKP and leads to poor performance when the instance is not adversarial.

Introduced by (Lykouris & Vassilvtiskii, 2018; Purohit et al., 2018), learning-augmented algorithm design is a framework which has gained traction as a method to leverage machine-learned predictions in algorithms without sacrificing worst-case competitive guarantees. Under this framework, online algorithms are evaluated using the concepts of consistency and robustness, which give the competitive performance when the advice is accurate or completely wrong, respectively. Recent work (Im et al., 2021; Zeynali et al., 2021; Lechowicz et al., 2023b; Böckenhauer et al., 2014b) has explored OKP with advice or machine-learned predictions (see Appendix A.1 for a comprehensive review). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works consider OFKP with prediction. The most relevant work Sun et al. (2021a) considers a special case of OFKP (referred to as one-way trading) with predictions, in which the weights of items are all equal to the knapsack capacity. In this case, a prediction of the maximum unit value is sufficient to guide the design of the learning-augmented algorithm since the offline optimal only accepts the item with the maximum value. However, in OFKP, the admission of each item is upper bounded by the item's weight (revealed online); thus, the prediction model in Sun et al. (2021a) cannot be generalized to OFKP.

Acknowledging the existing research gap in the literature, this paper focuses on the design and analysis of competitive algorithms for OFKP with advice. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a new prediction model (in the form of a simple prediction about a "critical unit value") for OFKP, and design an optimal algorithm with predictions that is shown to achieve a matching lower bound (see Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.4). Further, we generalize this algorithm by considering two imperfect prediction models for OFKP. The first such model considers predictions of an interval (as opposed to a single critical value), and the second such model considers predictions which are probabilistically correct. We show learning-augmented algorithms for both of these models that use imperfect predictions to improve performance in the average-case while maintaining worst-case guarantees (See Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 4.3). Besides theoretical analysis, we also evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithms in numerical experiments compared against baseline algorithms without prediction, showing that our algorithms significantly outperform baseline results for OFKP and can gracefully handle errors in the prediction.

Further, we develop novel technical approaches in both algorithm design and analysis to achieve the above theoretical results. Our proposed algorithm achieves constant competitive ratios in contrast to the classic result  $O(\ln (U / L))$ , which depends on the upper and lower bounds of the unit value. To achieve this, we strategically utilize thresholds to limit the selection of high-value items and reserve capacity for units with critical values, mimicking the choices made by an optimal algorithm. Moreover, our approach goes beyond worst-case scenarios, attaining a competitive ratio approaching 1. We achieve this by employing a "prebuying" strategy. Initially, we prioritize high-value items, and subsequently adjust the knapsack's capacity to accommodate lower-value items. This allows us to optimize selections by adapting our capacity allocation in favor of high-value items during the initial stages.

# 2 PROBLEM FORMULATION, PRELIMINARIES, AND PREDICTION MODEL

# 2.1 ONLINE FRACTIONAL KNAPSACK PROBLEM

In the online fractional knapsack problem (OFKP), there is a knapsack with a capacity of 1 (WLOG, since otherwise, all weights can be scaled down). Items arrive online, each with two properties: unit value  $(v_{i})$  and maximum weight  $(w_{i})$ . In the  $i^{th}$  step, an online algorithm must select some portion  $x_{i} \leq w_{i}$  of the  $i^{th}$  item to add to the knapsack. This decision must be based only on all items seen so far,  $(v_{1}, w_{1}), \ldots, (v_{i}, w_{i})$ , and is irrevocable. The algorithm obtains profit  $x_{i} v_{i}$  if it admits an  $x_{i}$  portion of the item into the knapsack. The objective is to maximize the total profit subject to the

Algorithm 1 TA: An online threshold-based algorithm for OFKP without prediction

2: output: online decision  $x_{i}$    
3: initialization: knapsack utilization  $z^{(0)} = 0$

6:  $x_{i} = 0$    
7: else if  $v_{i}\geq \phi (z^{(i - 1)})$  then   
8:  $x_{i} = \min \{\phi^{-1}(v_{i}) - z^{(i - 1)},w_{i},1 - z^{(i - 1)}\}$    
9: update  $z^{(i)} = z^{(i - 1)} + x_{i}$

knapsack's capacity. The offline version problem can be formulated as the following linear program:

$$
\max  \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} x _ {i} \cdot v _ {i}, \quad \text {s . t .} \quad \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} x _ {i} \leq 1 \quad \text {a n d} \quad 0 \leq x _ {i} \leq w _ {i} \leq 1 \quad \forall i \in [ n ]. \tag {1}
$$

We let  $U$  and  $L$  denote the maximum and minimum unit values for an instance. Note that these bounds are unknown to our algorithms and only used for analysis. This is in contrast to most existing works that assume  $U$  and  $L$  are known in advance (Zhou et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2021b).

# 2.2 PRIOR RESULTS: COMPETITIVE ALGORITHMS WITHOUT PREDICTION

Competitive ratio. OFKP has received considerable attention within the framework of competitive analysis. The primary goal is to design an online algorithm that, on every possible input instance, achieves a profit that is a large fraction of the optimum (Borodin et al., 1992). We denote  $\mathrm{OPT}(\mathcal{I})$  as the offline optimum on the input  $\mathcal{I}$ , and  $\mathrm{ALG}(\mathcal{I})$  represents the profit obtained by an online algorithm (ALG) on that input. If ALG is randomized, then we define  $\mathrm{ALG}(\mathcal{I})$  to be the expected profit on input instance  $\mathcal{I}$ . Formally, let  $\Omega$  denote the set of all possible inputs, the competitive ratio (CR) of an online algorithm is defined as  $\mathrm{CR} = \max_{\mathcal{I} \in \Omega} \frac{\mathrm{OPT}(\mathcal{I})}{\mathrm{ALG}(\mathcal{I})}$ . Observe that CR is greater than or equal to one. The smaller it is, the more effectively the algorithm performs.

State-of-the-art results. OFKP has seen relatively little attention in the literature despite being a classic relaxation of the integral knapsack problem. Most results for OFKP make different assumptions such as random ordering of the input (Giliberti & Karrenbauer, 2021) or introduce additional components such as removable items (Noga & Sarbua, 2005). A recent result by Sun et al. (2021b) is the closest to our setting, showing that if the unit value is bounded, i.e.,  $v_{i} \in [L,U], \forall i \in [n]$ , a threshold-based algorithm can achieve the optimal competitive ratio among all online algorithms.

The threshold-based algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. This algorithm takes a threshold function  $\phi(z): [0,1] \to [L,U]$  as its input. Specifically,  $\phi(z)$  can be understood as the pseudo price of packing a small amount of item when the knapsack's current utilization (i.e. the fraction of knapsack's total capacity which is filled with previously accepted items) is  $z$ . The algorithm rejects an item  $i$  if its unit value  $v_i$  is smaller than the pseudo price  $\phi(z^{(i-1)})$  at the current utilization  $z^{(i-1)}$ . Otherwise, the algorithm will continuously admit the item until one of the following three cases occurs: (i) the utilization reaches  $\phi^{-1}(v_i)$  (i.e., the pseudo price reaches  $v_i$ ); (ii) the entire item is admitted; or (iii) the knapsack capacity is used up. Notice the threshold function  $\phi$  is the only design space for Algorithm 1. Sun et al. (2021b) shows that the optimal competitive ratio can be attained when  $\phi$  is carefully designed as follows.

Lemma 2.1 (Theorem 3.5 & 3.6 in Sun et al. (2021b)). For OFKP, if the unit value of items is bounded within  $[L,U]$ , Algorithm 1 is  $(1 + \ln (U / L))$ -competitive when the threshold is given by

$$
\phi (z) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} L & z \in [ 0, 1 / (1 + \ln (U / L))) \\ L \exp ((1 + \ln (U / L)) z - 1) & z \in [ 1 / (1 + \ln (U / L)), 1 ] \end{array} \right.. \tag {2}
$$

Further, no online algorithms can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than  $1 + \ln (U / L)$ .

# 2.3 PREDICTION MODEL

We consider three prediction models for OFKP, each capturing a different prediction quality. All prediction models are constructed based on a critical value in the offline optimal solution. Thus,

we start by briefly describing the optimal offline solution for OFKP. Given that all item values and weights are known, the offline algorithm sorts the items in non-increasing order of unit value, and then greedily admits the sorted items until the knapsack capacity (See more detail in Appendix A.2).

Definition 2.2 (Minimum acceptable items  $(\hat{v},\hat{\omega})$ ). Given an instance for OFKP, let  $\hat{v}$  denote the minimum unit value of items admitted by the offline optimum, and  $\hat{\omega}$  denote the total weights of items with the same unit value  $\hat{v}$ . Then  $\hat{v}$  is defined as the critical value and  $(\hat{v},\hat{\omega})$  is defined as the minimum acceptable items for the instance.

Below, we present three prediction models which consider how perfect or imperfect knowledge of  $\hat{v}$  and  $\hat{\omega}$  from Def. 2.2 allows us to recover the optimal solution.

Prediction Model I (Perfect Predictions). An exact point prediction of  $\hat{v}$ , as defined in Def. 2.2 (the minimum acceptable unit value), is given to the learning-augmented online decision maker.

In the perfect prediction model, we assume that the learning-augmented decision maker has access to the exact minimum acceptable unit value  $\hat{v}$  for any given instance  $\mathcal{I} \in \Omega$ . Note that the optimal offline solution will fully admit any item with a unit value strictly greater than  $\hat{v}$ . However, it may fractionally admit the item with value  $\hat{v}$ . Hence, even with a perfect prediction of exact value  $\hat{v}$ , the online decision-maker cannot optimally solve the problem since it is unclear how much of the item with value  $\hat{v}$  should be admitted.

In practice, however, one may argue that it it almost impossible to obtain a perfect prediction of the exact value  $\hat{v}$ . Hence, we propose two extended prediction models which are practically relevant.

Prediction Model II (Interval Predictions). Deterministic lower and upper bounds on the actual value of  $\hat{v}$  (Def. 2.2), are given to the learning-augmented online decision maker. Denote these by  $\ell$  and  $u$ , respectively. Any such prediction satisfies  $\ell \leq \hat{v} \leq u$ .

The second prediction model assumes that there is no exact prediction on  $\hat{v}$ . Instead, the predictions given to the algorithm are bounds on  $\hat{v}$ , i.e.,  $\hat{v} \in [\ell, u]$ . The quality of prediction in this c  $u - \ell$  increases. In an extreme case of  $u = \ell$ , the interval prediction degenerates to the aforementioned perfect prediction. On the other hand, with  $u = U$  and  $\ell = L$ , the problem degenerates to the classic OFKP (see § 2.2) with prior knowledge on the unit value bounds.

Prediction Model III (Probabilistic Interval Predictions). As in Prediction Model II, the learning-augmented online decision maker receives lower and upper bounds  $\ell$  and  $u$  on  $\hat{v}$  (Def. 2.2), and this prediction is probabilistically correct, i.e.,  $\mathbb{P}(\hat{v} \in [\ell, u]) = 1 - \delta$ , where  $\delta > 0$ .

Our last model relaxes the deterministic interval prediction into a probabilistic prediction such that with probability of  $1 - \delta$ , the critical value  $\hat{v}$  is lower and upper bounded by  $\ell$  and  $u$ . This relaxation allows us to analyze the case where predictions are untrusted and arbitrarily wrong.

In §3, we leverage the perfect prediction to design learning-augmented algorithms for OFKP and show the algorithms achieve the optimal competitive ratios. In §4, we study learning-augmented algorithms with imperfect prediction models and present an algorithm that utilizes the previously described algorithms as sub-algorithms to achieve practical competitiveness.

# 3 ALGORITHMS WITH PERFECT PREDICTION

# 3.1 LOWER BOUND RESULTS

We first present a lower bound result showing that even with a perfect prediction of the critical value  $\hat{v}$ , no deterministic or randomized learning-augmented algorithm can solve OFKP optimally.

Theorem 3.1. Given an exact prediction on the critical value  $\hat{v}$ , no online algorithm for OFKP can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than  $1 + \min\{1, \hat{\omega}\}$ , where  $\hat{\omega}$  is the total weight of items with the critical value for all instances in  $\Omega$ .

The above result implies a lower bound of 2 on the competitive ratio, even if the algorithm has a perfect prediction of  $\hat{v}$ . Even if we know that the optimal solution admits an item with critical value  $\hat{v}$ , it is unclear how much weight of the knapsack should be filled with items of unit value  $\hat{v}$ .

# 3.2 PERFECT-PREDICTION-BASED ALGORITHMS

In this section, we first present PPA-n, a naive perfect-prediction-based algorithm that can result in arbitrarily large competitive ratios. Then, we present PPA-b, a basic perfect-prediction-based algorithm for OFKP that achieves the competitive ratio of 2 given the exact prediction  $\hat{v}$ . Then, we present PPA-a, an advanced version of PPA-b that improves the competitive ratio to  $1 + \hat{\omega}$ , matching the lower bound value presented in Theorem 3.1. Recall that  $\hat{\omega}$  is the weight of items with value  $\hat{v}$  and unknown to all proposed algorithms.

PPA-n: A naive perfect-prediction-based algorithm: We first consider a naive "greedy" algorithm that takes a prediction on  $\hat{v}$  as input. This algorithm rejects any items with unit value  $< \hat{v}$  and fully accepts any item with unit value  $\geq \hat{v}$  until the capacity limit. In Theorem 3.2, we show that PPA-n fails to achieve a meaningful improvement in the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., consistency since we assume the prediction is correct).

Theorem 3.2. PPA-n that fully trusts the prediction is  $U / L$ -competitive in the worst case.

PPA-b: A basic perfect-prediction-based 2-competitive algorithm. We present an algorithm (Algorithm 2) that, given the exact prediction of  $\hat{v}$ , is 2-competitive for OFKP. The idea is to set aside half of the capacity only for high-value items (whose unit value  $> \hat{v}$ ) and allocate the other half for admitting minimum acceptable items with exact value  $\hat{v}$ . By doing so, we will at least obtain half of either part in the optimal solution. Furthermore, this competitive ratio is optimal since no algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than 2 in the worst case as shown in Theorem3.1.

Algorithm 2 PPA-b: A basic 2-competitive algorithm for OFKP with perfect prediction  
1: input: prediction  $\hat{v}$    
2: output: online decisions  $x_{i}$  s.   
3: while item i (with unit value  $v_{i}$  and weight  $w_{i}$  ) arrives do   
4: if  $v_{i} <   \hat{v}$  then   
5:  $x_{i} = 0$  .   
6: else if  $v_{i} > \hat{v}$  then   
7:  $x_{i} = w_{i} / 2$  .   
8: else if  $v_{i} = \hat{v}$  then   
9:  $x_{i} = \min (w_{i} / 2,1 / 2 - z)$    
10:  $z = z + x_{i}$

Theorem 3.3. Given a perfect prediction, PPA-b is 2-competitive.

Proof Sketch of Theorem 3.3. Assuming unique prices,  $\mathbb{P}\mathbb{P}\mathbb{A} - \mathbb{b}$  selects half of each item with a unit value  $v_{i}$  where  $v_{i}\geq \hat{v}$ . Essentially, it allocates half of the knapsack's capacity to items with values above  $\hat{v}$  and the other half to items with values equal to  $\hat{v}$ . This intuitive approach gives us at least half the value of the offline optimal solution. The full proof is in Appendix A.3.3.

We note that most existing works for OFKP and related problems (Marchetti-Spaccamela & Vercellis, 1995; El-Yaniv et al., 2001) make the assumption that item unit values are bounded, i.e.,  $v_{i} \in [L, U], \forall i \in [n]$ , which is usually necessary to achieve non-trivial competitive bounds in the setting without predictions. Subsequent competitive bounds in these works depend on  $U, L$ , and the ratio between them (i.e.,  $U / L$ ). In our setting, the predictions allow us to achieve a constant competitive ratio that is independent of  $U$  and  $L$ .

In the following, our goal is to propose a new algorithm that achieves a better parameterized competitive ratio than that of PPA-b. This can be accomplished by modifying Algorithm 2 to introduce a parameter, which represents the quantity we select when encountering  $\hat{v}$  (instead of fixed  $1/2$ ). This parameter allows us to reserve a portion for more valuable items more effectively.

Under the assumption that the unit value  $v_{i}$  of each item in the instance is unique, (i.e.  $i \neq j \rightarrow v_{i} \neq v_{j} \forall i, j \in [n]$ ), we can further refine the above concept to achieve a competitive ratio of  $1 + \hat{\omega}$ , where  $\hat{\omega}$  denotes the weight of the single item with critical value  $\hat{v}$ . This modified algorithm can exhibit high efficiency, particularly when dealing with small values of  $\hat{\omega}$ . For example, in scenarios

Algorithm 3 PPA-a: An advanced  $(1 + \hat{\omega})$ -competitive algorithm with perfect prediction  
1: input: prediction  $\hat{v}$    
2: output: online decisions  $x_{i}$  s.   
3:  $\mathrm{b} = 0$ $s = 0$    
4: while item i (with unit value  $v_{i}$  and weight  $w_{i}$  ) arrives do   
5: if  $v_{i} <   \hat{v}$  then   
6:  $x_{i} = 0$  .   
7: else if  $v_{i} > \hat{v}$  and  $b = 0$  then   
8:  $x_{i} = w_{i}$    
9:  $s = s + x_i\times v_i$    
10: else if  $v_{i} = \hat{v}$  then   
11:  $b = 1$    
12:  $x_{i} = \max ((\hat{\omega} /(1 + \hat{\omega})\times \hat{v} -s\times (\hat{\omega} /(1 + \hat{\omega}))) / \hat{v},0)$    
13: else if  $v_{i} > \hat{v}$  and  $b = 1$  then   
14:  $x_{i} = w_{i} / (\hat{\omega} +1)$

resembling the  $k$ -search problem, where the weight of each item is  $\frac{1}{k}$ , this modification yields a competitive algorithm with a ratio of  $1 + \frac{1}{k}$ .

PPA-a: An improved  $(1 + \hat{\omega})$ -competitive algorithm. PPA-a leverages the observation that we can accept more than half of an item for values exceeding the prediction when  $\hat{\omega}$  is low. However, since we don't have prior knowledge of  $\hat{\omega}$ , we exploit a "prebuying" strategy. Initially, we select all items with unit values  $> \hat{v}$  and subsequently adjust our selections upon observing the prediction. This adaptive approach ensures that we select an appropriate portion of the prediction to achieve the desired competitive ratio. We note that here  $\hat{\omega}$  represents the weight of a single item, since we assume that each item has a unique unit value.

Theorem 3.4. Given perfect prediction, PPA-a achieves a competitive ratio of  $1 + \hat{\omega}$  for OFKP with unique unit values.

Proof Sketch of Theorem 3.4. Let's consider the scenario where we have knowledge of  $\hat{\omega}$ , and our goal is to achieve a competitive ratio of  $1 / (1 + \hat{\omega})$ . One approach is to allocate  $1 / (1 + \hat{\omega})$  of the weight capacity for all items with  $v_{i} > \hat{v}$  and an additional  $1 / (1 + \hat{\omega})$  for items with the same value as  $\hat{v}$ . This strategy intuitively yields a  $(1 + \hat{\omega})$ -competitive algorithm. We need to ensure that this allocation is feasible, which can be demonstrated to be the case.

If we do not have prior knowledge of  $\hat{\omega}$ , we can employ a "prebuying" strategy for all items with values higher than  $\hat{v}$ . The extra capacity allocated to these items each has a higher unit value than  $\hat{v}$ , allowing us to reduce our selection from  $\hat{v}$  based on how much extra capacity we've allocated in previous items. The challenge here is to confirm the feasibility of this algorithm and provide a detailed analysis of its competitive ratio. The full proof is in Appendix A.3.4.

# 4 ALGORITHMS WITH (PROBABILISTIC) INTERVAL PREDICTION

In this section, we further consider deterministic and probabilistic interval predictions that can model different levels of imperfect predictions. Our goal is to show that even with imperfect predictions, it is possible to devise learning-augmented algorithms with competitive ratios better than classic worst-case optimized algorithms that do not make use of any additional predictions.

# 4.1 DETERMINISTIC INTERVAL PREDICTION

We present an algorithm that uses a deterministic interval prediction  $[\ell, u]$  for the critical value  $\hat{v}$ . IPA: An interval prediction-based algorithm. IPA draws inspiration from PPA-b and devises an algorithm to solve OFKP with predictions represented as intervals. It allocates a dedicated portion of the capacity for values higher than  $u$ , and employs another algorithm, such as TA, to solve OFKP within the interval. The results are then combined to yield a competitive result with a competitive ratio of  $\alpha + 1$ , where  $\alpha$  represents the competitive ratio of the sub-algorithm.

Algorithm 4 IPA: An interval-prediction-based algorithm for OFKP  
1: input: interval prediction  $\ell, u$ , robust algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  with competitive ratio  $\alpha$   
2: Output: Online decisions  $x_i$ ;  
3: initialize  $\mathcal{A}$   
4: while item  $i$  (with unit value  $v_i$  and weight  $w_i$ ) arrives do  
5: if  $v_i < \ell$  then  
6:  $x_i = 0$ ;  
7: else if  $v_i > u$  then  
8:  $x_i = 1 / (\alpha + 1) \times w_i$ ;  
9: else if  $v_i \in [\ell, u]$  then  
10: give item  $i$  to algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ ;  
11:  $x_i = \alpha / (\alpha + 1) \times x_i^{\mathcal{A}}$ ;

Theorem 4.1. Given a deterministic interval prediction  $[\ell, u]$  and a robust algorithm for OFKP with a competitive ratio of  $\alpha$ , IPA achieves a competitive ratio of  $\alpha + 1$  for OFKP.

Proof Sketch of Theorem 4.1. IPA resembles Algorithm 3. For unit values higher than  $u$ , this algorithm allocates  $1 / (\alpha + 1)$  of its weight. Within the range  $[\ell, u]$ , it employs a robust sub-algorithm, denoted as  $\mathcal{A}$ , which is  $\alpha$ -competitive. Using  $\alpha / (\alpha + 1)$  of the results obtained from  $\mathcal{A}$  intuitively yields a  $(\alpha + 1)$ -competitive solution for that range. The primary technical challenge is to demonstrate that we maintain competitiveness across all ranges. The full proof is in Appendix A.3.5.

Corollary 4.2. IPA is  $2 + \ln (u / \ell)$ -competitive for OFKP when the robust algorithm is given by Algorithm 1 (TA), for interval  $[\ell, u]$ .

Proof. The result follows by observing that the TA algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 is  $\ln (U / L) + 1$  competitive, where  $U$  and  $L$  are inputs to the algorithm. Letting  $U = u$  and  $L = \ell$ , we have that  $(\alpha + 1) = 2 + \ln (u / \ell)$ . This competitive ratio will be close to 2 if  $\ln (u / \ell)$  is small, and  $\ln (u / \ell)$  becomes smaller as  $\ell$  and  $u$  approach each other. For  $\ell = u$ , we recover the same 2-competitive result as PPA-b (Algorithm 2).

This algorithm combines TA, the robust algorithm which uses no prediction and achieves competitive ratio  $\ln(U / L) + 1$  (see Algorithm 1) with one of the prediction algorithms presented so far (PPA-b or IPA). If the prediction is correct, we say that the prediction algorithm is  $c$ -competitive.

For robustness purposes, we follow related work (Sun et al., 2021b; Marchetti-Spaccamela & Vercellis, 1995; El-Yaniv et al., 2001) and assume that item unit values are bounded, i.e.,  $v_{i} \in [L,U], \forall i \in [n]$ . Note that  $L$  and  $U$  are not related to the predicted interval  $[\ell ,u]$ . We balance between the sub-algorithms (TA and prediction ALG) by setting a trust parameter  $\gamma \in [0,1]$ . Both algorithms run in parallel - when an item arrives, PIPA receives as input an item with unit value  $v_{i}$ , a weight  $w_{i}$ , and two decisions  $\hat{x}_i$  and  $\tilde{x}_i$ , representing the decisions of the prediction and robust algorithms, respectively. Then PIPA simply purchases  $x_{i} = \gamma \hat{x}_{i} + (1 - \gamma)\tilde{x}_{i}$  fraction of the item. Note that

when  $\gamma = 1$ , PIPA will make the same decisions as the inner prediction algorithm, and when  $\gamma = 0$ , PIPA will make the same decisions as the inner robust algorithm TA. We assume that the inner prediction algorithm is chosen based on the type of prediction received, e.g. a point or interval prediction.

Suppose that the predictions are correct with probability  $(1 - \delta) \in [0, 1]$ . With  $\delta = 1$ , the predictions are always incorrect, and with  $\delta = 0$ , we recover the setting where the prediction is always correct. In Lemma 4.3, we give bounds on the consistency and robustness of this meta-algorithm.

Lemma 4.3. PIPA is  $\frac{\ln(U / L) + 1}{(1 - \gamma)}$ -robust and  $\frac{c}{\gamma}$ -consistent for any  $\gamma \in (0,1)$ , where  $c$  denotes the competitive ratio of the inner prediction algorithm with an accurate prediction.

Proof Sketch of Lemma 4.3. We first calculate the expected payoff of  $\mathsf{PIPA}$  based on the trust parameter  $\gamma$  and probability  $\delta$  as  $\mathbb{E}[\mathsf{PIPA}[\gamma](\mathcal{I})] = \gamma \cdot (1 - \delta)\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{I}) + (1 - \gamma)\cdot \mathsf{TA}(\mathcal{I})$ . To analyze the consistency and robustness of  $\mathsf{PIPA}$ , we consider two extreme cases for  $\delta$  (i.e. when  $\delta = 0$ , the prediction is correct and we derive a consistency bound, and when  $\delta = 1$ , the prediction is always incorrect and we derive a robustness bound). The full proof is in Appendix A.3.6.

As a corollary, Lemma 4.3 shows that the expected payoff of PIPA is  $\gamma (1 - \delta)\frac{\mathrm{OPT}}{c} +(1 - \gamma)\frac{\mathrm{OPT}}{1 + \ln(U / L)}$ , even if  $\delta$  is unknown. If the prediction has enough probability of being correct, e.g.  $1 - \delta \geq \frac{c}{\ln(U / L) + 1}$ , increasing  $\gamma$  will raise the expected payoff. Setting  $\gamma$  close to 1 will result in a competitive algorithm with a ratio of approximately  $c / (1 - \delta)$ . When using Algorithm 4, this competitiveness increases to approximately  $2 + \ln (u / \ell) / (1 - \delta)$ , which is particularly practical for small intervals.

# 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

Experimental setup and comparison algorithms. To validate the performance of our algorithms, we conduct experiments using synthetically generated data, where the value and weight of items are randomly drawn from a power-law distribution. Unless otherwise mentioned, the lowest unit value is  $L = 1$ , and the highest unit value is  $U = 1000$ . Weights are drawn from a power law but normalized to be within the range of 0 to 1. We report the cumulative density functions of the empirical competitive ratios, which illustrate different algorithms' average and worst-case performances.

To report the empirical competitive ratio of different algorithms, we implement the offline optimal solution as described in Appendix A.2. We compare the results of the following online algorithms under various experimental settings: (1) TA: the classic online algorithms without prediction (Algorithm 1); (2) PPA-n: the naive prediction-based algorithm; (3) PPA-b: the basic prefect-2-competitive algorithm (Algorithm 2); (4) PPA-a: the advanced  $(1 + \hat{\omega})$ -competitive algorithm (Algorithm 3); (5) IPA: the interval-prediction-based algorithm (Algorithm 4); and (6) probabilistic-interval-prediction-based (Algorithm 5). For the IPA algorithm, we present the interval prediction range  $u - \ell$  as a percentage of range [L,U] and set it to three values of  $15\%$ ,  $25\%$ , and  $40\%$ . For PIPA, the value of  $1 - \delta$  is set to  $10\%$ ,  $20\%$ , and  $50\%$ , and it is labeled as  $\mathsf{PIPA}_{\delta}$ . Similarly,  $\mathsf{PIPA}_{\gamma}$  denotes that different variants PIPA under different values of the trust parameter  $\gamma$ , which in our

experiment we vary using three values of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.9. Furthermore, for  $\mathrm{PPA - b}$ ,  $\hat{\omega}$  is set to four arbitrary values of 0.29, 0.45, 0.63, and 0.78.

Experimental results. Figure 1(a) reports the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of empirical competitive ratios for six different algorithms on 2000 synthetic instances of OFKP. The most notable observations are: (1) among all prediction-based algorithms, PPA-a achieves the best performance in both average and worst-case performance, verifying the theoretical results in Thm. 3.4. (2) while the average performance of PPA-n outperforms most algorithms (except PPA-a), its worst-case performance is even worse than TA, that do not leverage predictions in decision-making; this observation verifies the poor consistency of PPA-n reported in Thm. 3.2. (3) even with imperfect prediction, IPA outperforms TA in both average and worst-case results. (4) while achieving a bounded competitive ratio, TA performs on average worse than all prediction algorithms.

We now report the results of the impact of the parameters on the performance of different algorithms. First, our theoretical results show that different from classic algorithms such as TA, the competitive ratio of the prediction-based algorithms is independent of the ratio between the most and least valuable items, i.e.,  $U / L$ . In Figure 1(b), we verify this theoretical observation by varying the value  $U / L$  from 300 to 1000, 5000, and 20000. The results in Figure 1(b) show that the empirical competitive ratio of TA drastically increases as  $U / L$  increases while other algorithms are robust to the variations of  $U / L$ . In Figure 1(c), we change the values of  $\hat{\omega}$ , and the results show that, in contrast to PPA-n, PPA-b, and TA, the performance of PPA-a substantially improves with smaller values of  $\hat{\omega}$  verifying the results in Thm. 3.4 on the dependence of the competitive ratio of PPA-a on  $\hat{\omega}$ .

In Figure 2(a), we evaluate the performance of IPA for different interval prediction widths, given as a percentage (higher is worse). As shown in Theorem 4.1, we find that tighter prediction intervals yield better empirical performance. Furthermore, all IPA algorithms outperform the baseline robust TA algorithm. In Figure 2(b), we evaluate the performance of PIPA for imperfect predictions. We test regimes where  $1 - \delta$  (probability of correct prediction) is  $10\%$ ,  $20\%$ , and  $50\%$ ; we fix  $\gamma = 0.9$  and the interval is  $20\%$  of  $[L, U]$ . We find that the performance of PIPA smoothly degrades, and even bad predictions result in an algorithm that outperforms the robust baseline TA. Finally, in Figure 2(c), we show a similar result for PIPA- we fix  $\delta = 50\%$  and vary the trust parameter  $\gamma \in \{0.3, 0.5, 0.9\}$ , showing that when predictions are sufficiently good, PIPA performs better when the predictions are trusted more (i.e., increasing  $\gamma$ ). In Appendix A.4, we include additional results which further contextualize the performance of our proposed algorithms.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We study learning-augmented algorithms for the online fractional knapsack problem (OFKP) under predictions with varying quality. Given a perfect prediction, we have developed an online algorithm that can leverage the prediction and achieve the optimal competitive ratio. When the prediction is correct within an interval or probabilistically correct, we have further designed two algorithms that can use such imperfect predictions and achieve consistency and robustness improving average-case performance and giving worst-case guarantees, respectively. Through extensive numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed algorithms outperform all existing benchmark algorithms.
