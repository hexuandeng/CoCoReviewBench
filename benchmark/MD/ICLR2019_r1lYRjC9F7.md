# ABSTRACT

Generating musical audio directly with neural networks is notoriously difficult because it requires coherently modeling structure at many different timescales. Fortunately, most music is also highly structured and can be represented as discrete note events played on musical instruments. Herein, we show that by using notes as an intermediate representation, we can train a suite of models capable of transcribing, composing, and synthesizing audio waveforms with coherent musical structure on timescales spanning six orders of magnitude ( $\sim 0.1$  ms to  $\sim 100$  s). This large advance in the state of the art is enabled by our release of the new MAESTRO (MIDI and Audio Edited for Synchronous TRacks and Organization) dataset, composed of over 172 hours of virtuosic piano performances captured with fine alignment ( $\pm 3$  ms) between note labels and audio waveforms. The networks and the dataset together present a promising approach toward creating new expressive and interpretable neural models of music.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Since the beginning of the recent wave of deep learning research, there have been many attempts to create generative models of expressive musical audio de novo. These models would ideally generate audio that is both musically and sonically realistic to the point of being indistinguishable to a listener from music composed and performed by humans.

However, modeling music has proven extremely difficult due to dependencies across the wide range of timescales that give rise to the characteristics of pitch and timbre (short-term) as well as those of rhythm (medium-term) and song structure (long-term). On the other hand, much of music has a large hierarchy of discrete structure embedded in its generative process: a composer creates songs, sections, and notes, and a performer realizes those notes with discrete events on their instrument, creating sound. The division between notes and sound is in many ways analogous to the division between symbolic language and utterances in speech.

The WaveNet model by van den Oord et al. (2016) may be the first breakthrough in generating musical audio directly with a neural network. Using an autoregressive architecture, the authors trained a model on audio from piano performances that could then generate new piano audio sample-by-sample. However, as opposed to their highly convincing speech examples, which were conditioned on linguistic features, the authors lacked a conditioning signal for their piano model. The result was audio that sounded very realistic at very short time scales (1 or 2 seconds), but that veered off into chaos beyond that.

Dieleman et al. (2018) made great strides towards providing longer term structure to WaveNet synthesis by implicitly modeling the discrete musical structure described above. This was achieved by training a hierarchy of VQ-VAE models at multiple time-scales, ending with a WaveNet decoder to generate piano audio as waveforms. While the results are impressive in their ability to capture long-term structure directly from audio waveforms, the resulting sound suffers from various artifacts at the fine-scale not present in the unconditional WaveNet, clearly distinguishing it from real musical audio. Also, while the model learns a version of discrete structure from the audio, it is not directly reflective of the underlying generative process and thus not interpretable or manipulable by a musician or user.

Figure 1: System architecture for our suite of piano music models, consisting of (a) a conditional WaveNet model that generates audio from MIDI, (b) a Transformer language model that generates piano performance MIDI autoregressively, and (c) a piano transcription model that "encodes" piano performance audio as MIDI.

Manzelli et al. (2018) propose a model that uses a WaveNet to generate solo cello music conditioned on MIDI notation. This overcomes the inability to manipulate the generated sequence. However, their model requires a large training corpus of labeled audio because they do not train a transcription model, and it is limited to monophonic sequences.

In this work, we seek to explicitly factorize the problem informed by our prior understanding of the generative process of performer and instrument:

$$
P (\text {a u d i o}) = P (\text {a u d i o} | \text {n o t e s}) P (\text {n o t e s}) \tag {1}
$$

which can be thought of as an autoencoder with a forced internal representation of musical notes. Since the internal representation is discrete, and the scale of the problem is too large to jointly train, we split the autoencoder into three separately trained modules that are each state-of-the-art in their respective domains:

1. Encoder,  $P(\text{notes|audio})$ : An Onsets and Frames (Hawthorne et al., 2018) transcription model to produce a symbolic representation (MIDI) from raw audio.  
2. Prior,  $P(\text{notes})$ : A self-attention-based language model (Huang et al., 2018) to generate new performances in MIDI format based on those transcribed in (1).  
3. Decoder,  $P(\text{audio|notes})$ : A WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2016) synthesis model to generate audio of the performances conditioned on MIDI generated in (2).

One hindrance to training such a stack of models is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets like those that exist for images. We overcome this barrier by curating and publicly releasing alongside this work a piano performance dataset containing well-aligned audio and symbolic performances an order of magnitude larger than the previous benchmarks.

In addition to the high quality of the samples our method produces (see https://goo.gl/6RzHZM), training a suite of models according to the natural musician/instrument division has a number of other advantages. First, the intermediate representation used is more suitable for human interpretation and manipulation. Similarly, factorizing the model in this way provides better modularity: it is easy to independently swap out different performance and instrument models. Using an explicit performance representation with modern language models also allows us to model structure at much larger time scales, up to a minute or so of music. Finally, we can take advantage of the large

amount of prior work in the areas of symbolic music generation and conditional audio generation. And by using a state-of-the-art music transcription model, we can make use of the same wealth of unlabeled audio recordings previously only usable for training end-to-end models by transcribing unlabeled audio recordings and feeding them into the rest of our model.

# 2 CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS PAPER

Our contributions are as follows:

1. We combine a transcription model, a language model, and a MIDI-conditioned WaveNet model to produce a factorized approach to musical audio modeling capable of generating about one minute of coherent piano music.  
2. We provide a new dataset of piano performance recordings and aligned MIDI, an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets.  
3. Using an existing transcription model architecture trained on our new dataset, we achieve state-of-the-art results on a piano transcription benchmark.

# 3 DATASET

We partnered with organizers of the International Piano-e-Competition<sup>1</sup> for the raw data used in this dataset. During each installment of the competition virtuoso pianists perform on Yamaha Disklaviers which, in addition to being concert-quality acoustic grand pianos, utilize an integrated high-precision MIDI capture and playback system. Recorded MIDI data is of sufficient fidelity to allow the audition stage of the competition to be judged remotely by listening to contestant performances reproduced over the wire on another Disklavier instrument.

The dataset introduced in this paper, which we name MAESTRO ("MIDI and Audio Edited for Synchronous TRacks and Organization"), contains over a week of paired audio and MIDI recordings from nine years of International Piano-e-Competition. The MIDI data includes key strike velocities and sustain pedal positions. Audio and MIDI files are aligned with  $\sim 3$  ms accuracy and sliced to individual musical pieces, which are annotated with composer, title, and year of performance. Uncompressed audio is of CD quality or higher (44.1–48 kHz 16-bit PCM stereo). A train/Validation/test split configuration is also proposed, so that the same composition, even if performed by multiple contestants, does not appear in multiple subsets. Repertoire is mostly classical, including composers from the  $17^{\text{th}}$  to early  $20^{\text{th}}$  century. Table 1 contains aggregate statistics of the MAESTRO dataset.

MAESTRO has a number of advantages over existing piano transcription datasets. Most significantly, as evident from table 2, MAESTRO is around an order of magnitude larger than existing piano transcription datasets. Existing datasets also have different properties than MAESTRO that affect the training of transcription models:

MusicNet (Thickstun et al., 2017) contains recordings of human performances, but separately-sourced scores. As discussed in Hawthorne et al. (2018), the alignment between audio and score

is not fully accurate. One advantage of MusicNet is that it contains instruments other than piano (not counted in table 2) and a wider variety of recording environments.

MAPS (Emiya et al., 2010) contains Disklavier recordings and synthesized audio created from MIDI files that were originally entered via sequencer. As such, the "performances" are not as natural as the MAESTRO performances captured from live performances. In addition, synthesized audio makes up a large fraction of the MAPS dataset. MAPS also contains syntheses and recordings of individual notes and chords, not counted in table 2.

Saarland Music Data (SMD) (Müller et al., 2011) is similar to MAESTRO in that it contains recordings and aligned MIDI of human performances on a Disklavier, but is 30 times smaller.

Table 2: Comparison with other datasets

# 3.1 ALIGNMENT

Our goal in processing the data from International Piano-e-Competition was to produce pairs of audio and MIDI files time-aligned to represent the same musical events. The data we received from the organizers was a combination of MIDI files recorded by Disklaviers themselves and WAV audio captured with conventional recording equipment. However, as recording streams were independent, they differed widely in start times and durations, and were also subject to jitter. Due to the large volume of content we developed an automated process for aligning, slicing, and time-warping provided audio and MIDI to ensure a precise match between the two.

Our approach is based on globally minimizing the distance between CQT frames from the real audio and synthesized MIDI (using FluidSynth²). Obtaining a highly accurate alignment is non-trivial, and we provide full details in the appendix.

# 3.2 DATASET SPLITTING

For all experiments in this paper, we use a single train/Validation/test split designed to satisfy the following criteria:

- No composition should appear in more than one split.  
- Train/validation/test should make up roughly 80/10/10 percent of the dataset (in time), respectively. These proportions should be true globally and also within each composer. Maintaining these proportions is not always possible because some composers have too few compositions in the dataset.  
- The validation and test splits should contain a variety of compositions. Extremely popular compositions performed by many performers should be placed in the training split.

For comparison with our results, we recommend using the splits which we have provided. We do not necessarily expect these splits to be suitable for all purposes; future researchers are free to use alternate experimental methodologies.

# 4 PIANO TRANSCRIPTION

The large MAESTRO dataset enables training an automatic piano music transcription model that achieves a new state of the art. We base our model on Onsets and Frames, with several modifications

determined by a coarse hyperparameter search using the validation split. For full details of the model architecture and training procedure, refer to Hawthorne et al. (2018).

We increased the size of the bidirectional LSTM layers from 128 to 256 units, changed the number of filters in the convolutional layers from 32/32/64 to 48/48/96, and increased the units in the fully connected layer from 512 to 768. We also stopped gradient propagation into the onset subnetwork from the frame network, disabled weighted frame loss, and switched to HTK frequency spacing (Young et al., 2006) for the mel-frequency spectrogram input. In general, we found that the best ways to get higher performance with the larger dataset were to make the model larger and simpler.

The final important change we made was to start using audio augmentation during training using an approach similar to the one described in McFee et al. (2017). During training, every input sample was modified using random parameters for the  $SoX^3$  audio tool. The parameters, ranges, and random sampling methods are described in table 3.

<table><tr><td>Description</td><td>Scale</td><td>Range</td><td>Sampling</td></tr><tr><td>pitch shift</td><td>semitones</td><td>-0.1–0.1</td><td>linear</td></tr><tr><td>contrast (compression)</td><td>amount</td><td>0.0–100.0</td><td>linear</td></tr><tr><td>equalizer 1</td><td>frequency</td><td>32.0–4096.0</td><td>log</td></tr><tr><td>equalizer 2</td><td>frequency</td><td>32.0–4096.0</td><td>log</td></tr><tr><td>reverb</td><td>reverberance</td><td>0.0–70.0</td><td>log</td></tr><tr><td>pinknoise</td><td>volume</td><td>0.0–0.04</td><td>linear</td></tr></table>

After training on the MAESTRO training split for  $178\mathrm{k}$ , we achieved the state of the art results described in table 4 for the MAPS dataset. We also present our results on the train, validation, and test splits of the MAESTRO dataset as a new baseline score in table 5. Note that for calculating the scores of the train split, we use the full duration of the files without splitting them into 20-second chunks as is done during training.

In sections 5 and 6, we demonstrate how using this transcription model enables training language and synthesis models on a large set of unlabeled piano data. To do this, we transcribe the audio in the MAESTRO training set, although in theory any large set of unlabeled piano music would work. We call this new, transcribed version of the training set MAESTRO-T. While it is true that the audio transcribed for MAESTRO-T was also used to train the transcription model, table 5 shows that the model performance is not significantly different between the training split and the test or validation splits, and we needed the larger split to enable training the other models.

# 5 TRANSFORMER TRAINING

For our generative language model, we use the decoder portion of a Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) with relative self-attention, which has previously shown compelling results in generating music with longer-term coherence (Huang et al., 2018). We trained two models, one on MIDI data from the MAESTRO dataset and another on MIDI transcriptions inferred by Onsets and Frames from audio in MAESTRO, referred to as MAESTRO-T in section 4. For full details of the model architecture and training procedure, refer to Huang et al. (2018).

We used the same training procedure for both datasets. We trained on random crops of 2048 events and employed transposition and time compression/stretching data augmentation. The transpositions were uniformly sampled in the range of a minor third below and above the original piece. The time stretches were at discrete amounts and uniformly sampled from  $[0.95, 0.975, 1.0, 1.025, 1.05]$ .

We evaluated both of the models on their respective validation splits.

# 6 PIANO SYNTHESIS

Most commercially available systems that are able to synthesize a MIDI sequence into a piano audio signal are concatenative: they stitch together snippets of audio from a large library of recordings of individual notes. While this stitching process can be quite ingenious, it does not optimally capture the various interactions between notes, whether they are played simultaneously or in sequence. An alternative but less popular strategy is to simulate a physical model of the instrument. Constructing an accurate model constitutes a considerable engineering effort and is a field of research by itself (Bank et al., 2010; Valimaki et al., 2012).

WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2016) is able to synthesize realistic instrument sounds directly in the waveform domain, but it is not as adept at capturing musical structure at timescales of seconds or longer. However, if we provide a MIDI sequence to a WaveNet model as conditioning information, we eliminate the need for capturing large scale structure, and the model can focus on local structure instead, i.e., instrument timbre and local interactions between notes. Conditional WaveNets are also used for text-to-speech (TTS), and have been shown to excel at generating realistic speech signals conditioned on linguistic features extracted from textual data. This indicates that the same setup could work well for music audio synthesis from MIDI sequences.

Our WaveNet model uses the same autoregressive architecture as van den Oord et al. (2016): 3 sequential stacks with 10 residual block layers each. However, we found that a deeper context stack, namely 2 stacks with 6 layers each arranged in a series, worked better for this task. We also updated the model to produce 16-bit output using a mixture of logistics as described in van den Oord et al. (2018).

The input to the context stack is a "piano roll" representation, a size-88 vector describing the state of all the keys on the keyboard updated every 4ms (250Hz). Each element of the vector is a float that represents the strike velocity of a piano key. While the key is being held down or sustained by the pedal, the state's value is the key's onset velocity scaled to the range [0, 1]. When the key is not active, the value is 0. To match the transcription method of Hawthorne et al. (2018), a value of 64 (half-pressed) was used to threshold the pedal signal and activate sustain.

We trained two models: one using the audio/MIDI pairs from the combined MAESTRO training/validation splits, and a second replacing the ground truth MIDI with MIDI inferred from the audio using the Onsets and Frames method, referred to as MAESTRO-T in section 4. The resulting losses after  $350\mathrm{k}$  training steps were 3.77 and 3.98, respectively. In order to provide a useful

evaluation of our synthesis model, we rely on human judgment, which we address in the following section.

A side effect of arbitrary windowing of the training data across note boundaries is a sonic crash that often occurs at the beginning of generated outputs. To sidestep this issue, we simply trim the first 2 seconds of all model outputs reported in this paper, and in the Online Supplement (https: //goo.gl/6RzHZM).

# 7 LISTENING TESTS

Since our ultimate goal is to create realistic musical audio, we carried out a listening study to determine the perceived quality of our method. To separately assess the effects of transcription, language modeling, and synthesis on the listeners' responses, we presented users with two 10-second clips drawn from the following sets, each relying on an additional model from our factorization:

Real Recordings Clips randomly selected from the MAESTRO validation audio split.

WaveNet Real/Real Clips generated by the WaveNet model trained with audio/MIDI pairs from the MAESTRO training and validation splits, conditioned on random 10-second MIDI subsequences from the MAESTRO test split.

WaveNet Transcription/Real Clips generated by the WaveNet model trained with audio and transcribed MIDI from MAESTRO-T (see section 4), conditioned on random 10-second subsequences from the MAESTRO test split.

WaveNet Transcription/Transformer Clips generated by the WaveNet model trained with audio and transcribed MIDI from MAESTRO-T (see section 4), conditioned on random 10-second subsequences from the Transformer model described in section 5 that was trained on MAESTRO-T.

The final set of samples demonstrates the full end-to-end ability of taking unlabeled piano performances, inferring MIDI labels via transcription, generating new performances with a language model trained on the inferred MIDI, and rendering new audio as though it were played on a similar piano—all without any information other than raw audio recordings of piano performances.

Participants were asked which clip they thought sounded more like a real piano performance, on a Likert scale. 384 ratings were collected, with each source involved in 96 pair-wise comparisons. Figure 2 shows the number of comparisons in which performances from each source were selected as more realistic.

Figure 2: Results of our listening tests, showing the number of times each source won in a pairwise comparison. Black error bars indicate estimated standard deviation of means.

A Kruskal-Wallis H test of the ratings showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the models:  $\chi^2 (2) = 22.05, p < 0.001$ . A post-hoc analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction showed that participants rated samples from the real recordings as more real than samples from the WaveNet models with  $p < 0.01 / 6$ . However, the WaveNet performances were rated as more real than the real recordings 66 out of 192 times, demonstrating that their realism is competitive. There was no significant difference in the ratings between the

WaveNet models trained on ground truth and those trained on transcribed MIDI, nor between models conditioned on ground truth and those conditioned on Transformer-generated sequences.

Audio of some of the examples used in the listening tests is available in the online supplement (https://goo.gl/6RzHZM).

# 8 CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated a system of models for factorized piano music modeling, all enabled by the new MAESTRO dataset. In this paper we have demonstrated all capabilities on the same dataset, but thanks to the new state-of-the-art piano transcription capabilities, any large set of piano recordings could be used. After transcribing the recordings, the transcriptions could be used to train a WaveNet and a Transformer model, and then new compositions could be generated with the Transformer and rendered with the WaveNet. These new compositions would have similar musical characteristics to the music in the original dataset, and the audio renderings would have similar acoustical characteristics to the source piano.

The most promising future work would be to extend this approach to other instruments or even multiple simultaneous instruments. Finding a suitable training dataset and achieving sufficient transcription performance will likely be the limiting factors.
