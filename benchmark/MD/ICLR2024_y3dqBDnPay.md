# ABSTRACT

Self-supervised representation learning on multimodal data plays a pivotal role in proficiently integrating and embedding information from various sources without the need for additional labeling. Notably, the majority of existing methods overlook the complex high-order inter- and intra-modality correlations characteristic of real-world multimodal data. In this paper, we introduce HyperRep, which combines the strength of hypergraph-based modeling with a self-supervised multimodal fusion information bottleneck principle. The former captures high-order correlations using hypergraphs to represent inter- and intra-modality relations, while the latter constrains the solution space, ensuring a more effective fusion of multimodal data. Our extensive experiments on four public datasets for three downstream tasks demonstrate HyperRep's superiority, as it consistently delivers competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Multimodal data, comprising various information types from diverse sources, is ubiquitous in today's data-driven world. Self-supervised representation learning for multimodal data is crucial, as it allows efficient fusion and embedding of information without requiring additional labels. This learning approach uncovers meaningful intrinsic patterns, making it ideal for various downstream applications like clustering Xu & II (2005); Xu & Tian (2015); Asano et al. (2020), text-to-video retrieval Alayrac et al. (2020); Chen et al. (2021), and temporal action localization Zhukov et al. (2019); Alwassel et al. (2020), etc. Effectively utilizing self-supervised multimodal representation learning can lead to more robust and versatile algorithms, addressing numerous real-world problems and advancing machine learning research.

Existing self-supervised representation learning methods for multimodal data are generally divided into pseudo-label-based Alwassel et al. (2020); Chen et al. (2021) and contrastive-based approaches Asano et al. (2020); Alayrac et al. (2020). While these methods have shown promise, they often overlook two key elements. First, they underrepresent the intricate high-order relationships inherent in multimodal data. Such correlations, like cross-modality within the same instance or cross-instance within the same modality, are integral to fully understanding the data. For example, consider a video of a car drifting. This might have high-order correlations with related images, engine sounds, and a text like "a car whizzing by", as illustrated in Fig.1(a). Similar correlations can be seen between instances of the same modality, as in Fig.1(b). Second, many existing methods lack clear principles for effective multimodal fusion, leading to potential redundancy or information loss. Addressing both these high-order relationships and fusion principles is vital for advancing representation learning in multimodal datasets.

While some methods attempt to incorporate high-order correlations in multimodal representation learning Gao et al. (2012); Zhang et al. (2018a;b), they rely on semi-supervised approaches. These require additional labeling information, which is often unavailable in many applications due to the labor-intensive nature of labeling, thus limiting their general applicability. Additionally, existing graph learning methods for multimodal representation learning Ektefaie et al. (2023) focus solely on pairwise relationships, neglecting the crucial high-order correlations that are commonly present in such data.

In this work, we present HyperRep, a pioneering approach to multimodal representation learning that masterfully bridges the intricate interplay of inter- and intra-modality correlations while ensuring that

(c) The relationship between modality information and instance information

essential information from each modality is accurately captured and retained. Central to HyperRep are two intertwined innovations: a hypergraph-based modeling technique and the self-supervised Multimodal Fusion information Bottleneck (MFB) principle.

Hypergraph offers a robust means to represent high-order structures resulting from intricate correlations spanning both within and across modalities. These hypergraphs, by virtue of connecting related vertices via a hyperedge, adeptly extract nuanced information that resonates across a group. We meticulously structure this representation by conceptualizing information from an individual modality of an instance as a vertex. This gives rise to two distinct hypergraph structures: the instance hypergraph, zeroing in on cross-modal instance correlations, and the modality hypergraph, tailored to hone in on cross-instance modality correlations. Such a dual hypergraph approach ensures a rich, all-encompassing capture of complex data, staving off any potential information dilution.

However, representation alone isn't enough. Introducing the MFB principle, a crucial mechanism that adeptly captures the core essence of multimodal data. Fig. 1(c) visually illustrates the fundamental concept of MFB: ensuring instances are infused with the shared modality information – the overlap where the shaded region encompasses the slashed zone. MFB plays a pivotal role by narrowing down the solution space, driving the model's gaze toward shared inter-modality information. It is not merely about contrastive learning between an instance and its modalities, but striking a fine balance by information bottleneck when faced with a huge amount of data from all modalities combined. To compute the MFB, we estimate the bounds of mutual information, allowing for an effective model optimization.

Contributions. In summary, our contributions are as follows: (a) We propose a hypergraph-based multimodal representation learning method that fully exploits high-order intra- and inter-modality correlations in multimodal data. (b) We introduce the self-supervised multimodal fusion information bottleneck principle to constrain the solution space and enhance the fusion of multimodal data. (c) Experiments are conducted on public benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each part of our proposed method.

# 2 RELATED WORK

# 2.1 SELF-SUPERVISED MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATION LEARNING

The advent of large-scale video datasets Miech et al. (2019) has fueled the evolution of representation learning approaches exploiting multimodal information in videos Zhu & Yang (2020); Sun et al. (2019); Patrick et al. (2021); Lei et al. (2021); Gabeur et al. (2020); Dong et al. (2022); Amrani et al. (2021); Alwassel et al. (2020); Asano et al. (2020); Alayrac et al. (2020); Chen et al. (2021). The key strategies involve contrastive-based and pseudo-labeling-based methods. XDC Alwassel et al. (2020), for instance, uses pseudo-labels from one modality to supervise another but yields separate representations, affecting cross-modality comparability. To mitigate this, MCN Chen et al. (2021) cultivates a joint space for multimodal data, aligning features with the same pseudo-labels. However, pseudo-labeling can generate inaccuracies and degenerate solutions. Alternatively, SeLaVi Asano et al. (2020) considers multi-modal data as instance augmentations and ensures permutation invariance, though it may dilute unique data features. Our approach is designed to

balance the benefits of contrastive methods and preserve the unique aspects of each data point, achieved through the construction of dual types of hypergraphs.

# 2.2 MULTIMODAL HYPERGRAPH LEARNING

Most multimodal learning research with hypergraphs leans towards semi-supervised approaches. For example, the MHL method Gao et al. (2012) constructs individual hypergraphs for each modality and optimizes their weights through alternating strategies. CDMH Zhang et al. (2018b) utilizes a multi-hypergraph structure to model multimodal data correlation and achieves convergence through a cross-diffusion process. Likewise, IMHL Zhang et al. (2018a) employs a multi-hypergraph to model correlations and supervises a projection from multimodal data to labels. AHGAE Hu et al. (2023), a recent unsupervised work, focuses on vertex representation for clustering, employing an adaptive hypergraph Laplacian smoothing filter and a relational reconstruction auto-encoder. However, this approach isn't explicitly tailored for multimodal data. In this work, we propose a method specifically tailored for multimodal data, using hypergraph structures to capture high-order correlations within and across different modalities.

# 3 METHOD

We are given a set of unlabeled multimodal data comprising  $n$  instances, each containing multimodal information such as video, audio, and text. Our goal is to learn instance representations for downstream tasks. In this section, we present our HyperRep method. We begin by introducing the construction of the hypergraph structure in Section 3.1. This is followed by an explanation of the hypergraph propagation process in Section 3.2. Afterward, we describe how the self-supervised multimodal fusion information bottleneck principle is employed for optimization in Section 3.3. For readers unfamiliar with hypergraph learning, a brief introduction is provided in the Appendix A.

Basic notations and definitions are provided as follows.  $n$  denotes the number of instances. The subscript  $s$  refers to instance, and  $v, a, t$  refers to video, audio, and text modalities, respectively. The instance set is defined as  $\mathbb{S} = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$ . Each instance  $s_i$  contains three modalities, each of which is considered as a separate vertex in this work. The vertex set is denoted as  $\mathbb{V} = \mathbb{V}_v \cup \mathbb{V}_a \cup \mathbb{V}_t$ , where  $\mathbb{V}_v, \mathbb{V}_a$ , and  $\mathbb{V}_t$  represent the vertex set of video, audio, and text modality, respectively. Correspondingly, the hyperedge set is defined as  $\mathbb{E} = \mathbb{E}_s \cup \mathbb{E}_m$ , whereas the instance and modality hyperedge sets are defined as  $\mathbb{E}_s = \{e_s^1, e_s^2, \ldots, e_s^n\}$  and  $\mathbb{E}_m = \mathbb{E}_v \cup \mathbb{E}_a \cup \mathbb{E}_t$ , respectively. The vertex features and hyperedge features are denoted as  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathbb{V}| \times d}$  and  $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathbb{E}| \times d}$ , respectively, where  $d$  denotes the dimension of the feature space. The incidence matrix of the whole hypergraph is defined as  $H$ , and  $H_s$  and  $H_m$  refer to the incidence matrix of the instance hypergraph and modality hypergraph, respectively.

# 3.1 HYPERGRAPH CONSTRUCTION

In the proposed model, the information from a single modality of an instance is treated as a vertex  $v$ . On this basis, dual types of hypergraphs are constructed: the instance hypergraph and the modality hypergraph.

Instance hypergraph. Different modalities in multimodal data are inherently interconnected. To capture these intrinsic correlations, we construct the instance hypergraph. Each instance contains multimodal information, and the instance hypergraph links corresponding cross-modal data. Specifically, the  $i$ -th instance hyperedge  $e_s^i = \{v_v^i, v_a^i, v_t^i\}$ , connects vertices that belong to the same instance. As shown in Fig. 2, the pink lines represent the instance hyperedges, each connecting three vertices from different modalities. The incidence matrix between the video vertex set  $\mathbb{V}_v$  and instance hyperedge set  $\mathbb{E}_s$  is defined as:

$$
H _ {s i, j} ^ {v} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1, & \text {i f} v _ {v} ^ {i} \in e _ {s} ^ {j} \\ 0, & \text {i f} v _ {v} ^ {i} \notin e _ {s} ^ {j} \end{array} . \right. \tag {1}
$$

![](images/47a5140a861c8e287c2afb08502fa7ae0cbf65c6be5dcff48a98678cf37c99c2.jpg)  
Figure 2: The pipeline of HyperRep. The hypergraph propagation module is shown in Fig. 3.

The same definition applies to audio and text modalities. Therefore, the incidence matrix between the full vertex set  $\mathbb{V}$  and instance hyperedge set  $\mathbb{E}_s$  can be calculated as:

$$
\boldsymbol {H} _ {s} = \left[ \begin{array}{l} \boldsymbol {H} _ {s} ^ {v} \\ \boldsymbol {H} _ {s} ^ {a} \\ \boldsymbol {H} _ {s} ^ {t} \end{array} \right]. \tag {2}
$$

Modality hypergraphs. The modality hypergraphs, namely the video hypergraph, audio hypergraph, and text hypergraph, capture the semantic correlations within each modality. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the video, audio, and text hyperedges are represented by green, blue, and yellow lines, respectively, with each line connecting several vertices from its corresponding modality. Hyperedges connect vertices that share similar semantics, which are identified based on the  $k$ -Nearest Neighbor ( $k$ -NN) algorithm. This approach aligns with the methodology used in HGNN Feng et al. (2019). The incidence matrix of the modality hypergraph between the video vertex set  $\mathbb{V}_v$  and video hyperedge set  $\mathbb{E}_v$  is given by:

$$
H _ {m} ^ {v} (i, j) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1, & \text {i f} \boldsymbol {v} _ {v} ^ {j} \in k - \mathrm {N N} \left(\boldsymbol {v} _ {v} ^ {i}\right) \\ 0, & \text {i f} \boldsymbol {v} _ {v} ^ {j} \notin k - \mathrm {N N} \left(\boldsymbol {v} _ {v} ^ {i}\right) \end{array} . \right. \tag {3}
$$

A similar process is followed for the audio and text modalities. Thus, the incidence matrix of the modality hypergraph between the full vertex set  $\mathbb{V}$  and the modality hyperedge set  $\mathbb{E}_m$  is:

$$
\boldsymbol {H} _ {m} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} \boldsymbol {H} _ {m} ^ {v} & \mathbf {0} & \mathbf {0} \\ \mathbf {0} & \boldsymbol {H} _ {m} ^ {a} & \mathbf {0} \\ \mathbf {0} & \mathbf {0} & \boldsymbol {H} _ {m} ^ {t} \end{array} \right]. \tag {4}
$$

# 3.2 HYPERGRAPH PROPAGATION

After constructing the hypergraphs, we introduce the hypergraph propagation module. In the proposed model, we utilize instance hyperedge features as instance representations for downstream tasks. This necessitates access to hyperedge features within our model. As illustrated in Fig. 3, information propagates from vertices to hyperedges and then back to vertices. Specifically, the information of vertices is aggregated to the corresponding hyperedges via the hypergraph structure to extract the high-order group features, and then passed back to the corresponding vertices. Therefore, the general paradigm of propagating information from vertex set  $\mathbb{V}$  to hyperedge set  $\mathbb{E}$  and back to  $\mathbb{V}$  through the hypergraph structure  $\pmb{H}$  in the  $l$ -th layer is formulated as:

$$
\boldsymbol {Y} ^ {(l + 1)} = f \left(\boldsymbol {X} ^ {(l)}, \boldsymbol {Y} ^ {(l)}, \boldsymbol {H}\right), \boldsymbol {X} ^ {(l + 1)} = f \left(\boldsymbol {Y} ^ {(l + 1)}, \boldsymbol {X} ^ {(l)}, \boldsymbol {H} ^ {\top}\right), \tag {5}
$$

where  $\mathbf{X}^{(l)}$  and  $\mathbf{Y}^{(l)}$  represent the features of vertices and hyperedges at layer  $l$ , and  $f$  is the hypergraph propagation function.

We then define the basic version of the hypergraph propagation function  $f$  as:

$$
f ^ {p} (\boldsymbol {X}, \boldsymbol {H}) = \boldsymbol {D} ^ {- 1} \boldsymbol {H} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {X} \boldsymbol {\Theta}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\pmb{D} = \mathrm{diag}(\pmb{d})$  and  $d_{i} = \sum_{j}H_{j,i}$ , and  $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$  is the learnable parameter matrix. Consequently,  $\pmb{D}$  represents the edge degree matrix  $D_{e}$  and vertex degree matrix  $D_{v}$  when the input is  $\pmb{H}$

![](images/063fe4658e7e9cbef052a9e1f5558c916c0ee24b40a5ed9dd530f00eab91158f.jpg)  
Figure 3: Hypergraph propagation module described in Eq. 8 to Eq. 11. Unlike in Fig. 2, hyperedges are represented as circles here for the sake of clarity. However, their colors remain consistent.

and  $H^{\top}$ , respectively. However, cross-modality information may have varying importance in each instance. To overcome this limitation, we utilize the hypergraph attention module to achieve better fusion across different modalities.

Hypergraph attention module. The attention mechanism within the hypergraph is designed to learn the attention weights between vertices and hyperedges. This is because different vertices have varying degrees of importance for the corresponding hyperedges, and vice versa. Consequently, we perform the scaled dot-product attention Vaswani et al. (2017) from vertices to hyperedges with mask  $H$ , and define the propagation function  $f$  as:

$$
f ^ {a t t n} (\boldsymbol {X}, \boldsymbol {Y}, \boldsymbol {H}) = \operatorname {S o f t m a x} \left(\operatorname {M a s k} \left(\frac {\boldsymbol {Y} \boldsymbol {W} ^ {q} \left(\boldsymbol {X} \boldsymbol {W} ^ {k}\right) ^ {\top}}{\sqrt {\boldsymbol {d} _ {k}}}, \boldsymbol {H} ^ {\top}\right)\right) \boldsymbol {X} \boldsymbol {W} ^ {v}, \tag {7}
$$

where  $W^{q} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_{k}}$ ,  $W^{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_{k}}$ , and  $W^{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  are learnable parameter matrices, and  $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}$  is the scaling factor. In essence, attention weights are considered only between the vertices and the hyperedges that are associated with the incidence matrix  $H$  created previously. Through the use of the hypergraph attention module, attention-weighted aggregation information can be obtained.

Propagation process. The hypergraph propagation module operates as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(0)} = \frac {1}{3} \left(\boldsymbol {X} _ {v} ^ {(0)} + \boldsymbol {X} _ {a} ^ {(0)} + \boldsymbol {X} _ {t} ^ {(0)}\right), \tag {8}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l + 1)} = f ^ {\text {a t t n}} \left(\boldsymbol {X} ^ {(l)}, \boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l)}, \boldsymbol {H} _ {s} ^ {\top}\right), \tag {9}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {Y} _ {m} ^ {(l + 1)} = f ^ {p} \left(\boldsymbol {X} ^ {(l)}, \boldsymbol {H} _ {m} ^ {\top}\right), \tag {10}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {X} ^ {(l + 1)} = f ^ {\text {a t t n}} \left(\left[ \boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l + 1)} \| \boldsymbol {Y} _ {m} ^ {(l + 1)} \right], \boldsymbol {X} ^ {(l)}, \left[ \boldsymbol {H} _ {s} \| \boldsymbol {H} _ {m} \right]\right), \tag {11}
$$

where  $\cdot\| \cdot$  denotes concatenation operation. After propagation through  $L$  layers, the instance hyperedge feature  $\mathbf{Y}_s^{(l + 1)}$  is used for the execution of downstream tasks.

The hypergraph propagation module we've designed serves a dual purpose: extracting cross-modal instance semantic consistency and modality-specific semantics from different hypergraphs. Simultaneously, it ensures the intricate data from these varying hypergraphs is preserved by the vertices, minimizing the potential for significant information loss.

# 3.3 SELF-SUPERVISED MULTIMODAL FUSION INFORMATION BOTTLENECK PRINCIPLE

Multimodal representations encapsulate both the shared information across modalities and the unique feature information specific to each modality. As depicted in Fig. 1 (c), individual circles represent the information of a single modality, while the shaded circle symbolizes the information of the instance. The overlapped, slashed portions of the modality circles represent the shared information jointly expressed across two or three modalities. In contrast, the distinct white sections denote the modality-specific feature information.

Ideally, the instance information should contain the modality-shared information, i.e., the shaded area of the instance circle should encompass the slashed areas shared by the modality circles. To achieve this, we introduce the Multimodal Fusion information Bottleneck (MFB) principle, which aims to maximize the mutual information between the instance and each modality, while minimizing the mutual information between the instance and the totality of information. In terms of Fig. 1 (c), this can be viewed as maximizing the area of overlap between the instance circle and each modality circle, while minimizing the overlap between the instance circle and the union of all modality circles. By guiding the instance representation learning process to focus more on the shared multimodal information, MFB effectively constrains the solution space to a narrower range, directing the model's attention towards the shared information across modalities.

The MFB principle for the  $l$ -th layer instance hyperedge representation is formulated as follows:

$$
\min  _ {p \left(\boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l)} \mid \boldsymbol {X} ^ {(0)}\right) \in \Omega} \operatorname {M F B} \left(\boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l)}; \boldsymbol {X} ^ {(0)}\right) \triangleq - \sum_ {m} \mathcal {I} \left(\boldsymbol {X} _ {m} ^ {(0)}; \boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l)}\right) + \beta \mathcal {I} \left(\boldsymbol {X} ^ {(0)}; \boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l)}\right), \tag {12}
$$

where  $\Omega$  represents the search space of the conditional distribution of  $Y_{s}^{(l)}$  given the initial vertex feature  $X^{(0)}$ , and the hyper-parameter  $\beta$  serves to balance the weight of the two components.

Estimation of MFB. Since mutual information becomes intractable when the probability distribution is unknown, we perform upper and lower bound estimations to enable its computation and training via back propagation.

Proposition 1. The upper and lower bounds of the mutual information between two random variables  $\mathbf{x}$  and  $\mathbf{y}$  can be estimated as:

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \log \frac {f (\boldsymbol {y} _ {+} , \boldsymbol {x})}{\sum_ {v y _ {i} \in Y} f (\boldsymbol {y} _ {i} , \boldsymbol {x})} \right] \leq \mathcal {I} (\mathbf {x}; \mathbf {y}) \leq D _ {\mathrm {K L}} (p (\mathbf {x} | \mathbf {y}) \| q (\mathbf {x})), \tag {13}
$$

where  $\mathbf{x}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{+}$  are positive pairs sampled from  $p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y})$ ,  $f(\cdot, \cdot)$  is a scoring function that measures the similarity between two embeddings, and  $q$  is a prior distribution of  $\mathbf{x}$ .

The proof is provided in the Appendix B. The form of the mutual information's lower bound above is known as the InfoNCE loss van den Oord et al. (2018). Consequently, the MFB loss can be expressed as:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {M F B}} = \sum_ {m} \mathcal {L} _ {\text {I n f o N C E}} \left(\boldsymbol {X} _ {m} ^ {(0)}, \boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l)}\right) + \beta D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(p \left(\boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l)} \mid \boldsymbol {X} ^ {(0)}\right) \| q \left(\boldsymbol {Y} _ {s} ^ {(l)}\right)\right). \tag {14}
$$

The calculation of the MFB loss is detailed in the Appendix C.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In order to evaluate the quality of the representations learned by HyperRep, we conduct a series of experiments on downstream tasks. These experiments encompass three primary areas of investigation: (1) comparisons against state-of-the-art methods on clustering task in Section 4.1; (2) ablation studies for each component of the proposed method in Section 4.2; (3) more downstream tasks, including text-to-video retrieval and temperoal action localization task, in Section 4.3. The implementation details, sensitivity and convergence analysis, computation complexity analysis can be found in the Appendix E, J and I, respectively.

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTS ON CLUSTERING TASK

Datasets. We perform clustering experiments on three publicly available datasets: AVE (Audio-Visual Event) Tian et al. (2018), MSR-VTT (Microsoft Research Video to Text) Xu et al. (2016), and YouCook2 Zhou et al. (2018). The detailed description of datasets can be found in the Appendix D. Each of these is a video dataset from which we extract multimodal information. We filter out instances with missing modalities.

Metrics. We assess our method using the metrics of accuracy (Acc), normalized mutual information (NMI), and adjusted rand index (ARI). The computation of metrics can be found in the Appendix F. The accuracy is calculated post self-supervised label matching to the ground truth via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm Kuhn (1955).

Baselines. We evaluate our approach against ten distinct methodologies, which fall under the following categories: (1) Feature-dependent clustering techniques, such as K-means and spectral clustering. (2) Graph and hypergraph-driven representation and clustering approaches, exemplified by AGC Zhang et al. (2019), AGE Cui et al. (2020), AdaGAE Li et al. (2022), and AHGAE Hu et al. (2023). (3) Cutting-edge video representation techniques like SeLaVi Asano et al. (2020), MCN Chen et al. (2021), MFLVC Xu et al. (2022), and CrossCLR Zolfaghari et al. (2021). It's noteworthy that SeLaVi is limited to audio and video modalities. For an equitable evaluation, models, specifically SeLaVi and MCN, which come pre-trained on other datasets, are fine-tuned during our experimentation. With the exception of SeLaVi that operates directly on raw videos, all other methodologies leverage identical input features as our approach. Although CrossCLR's primary novelty is its loss function, we match CrossCLR's performance merely by substituting the MFB loss with CrossCLR's, overlooking variations attributed to network design.

Experimental results on clustering task. As displayed in Table 1, HyperRep demonstrates excellent performance across all three datasets, outperforming all other methods in all metrics. On the AVE dataset, it leads AGC by  $8.2\%$ ,  $6.9\%$ , and  $16.7\%$  in Acc, NMI, and ARI metrics respectively, and outpaces CrossCLR by  $3.6\%$ ,  $8.0\%$ , and  $11.8\%$ . For the MSR-VTT dataset, it surpasses MCN with margins of  $4.0\%$ ,  $0.8\%$ , and  $2.3\%$ . On the YouCook2 dataset, the advantages against MCN are  $10.4\%$ ,  $2.3\%$ , and  $25.4\%$ , and when compared to CrossCLR, they stand at  $5.7\%$ ,  $3.6\%$ , and  $20.7\%$  for the same metrics. The consistent outperformance of HyperRep showcases its efficacy and robustness in multimodal representation learning.

Specifically, the high Acc shows our model's ability to accurately group instances into the correct clusters. This indicates that the multimodal representations learned by HyperRep effectively capture the specific characteristics of each instance. This accuracy suggests that the model can derive distinct representations that clearly separate instances based on their inherent attributes. The significant ARI, which measures the consistency between true and predicted cluster assignments while accounting for random groupings, shows that our model's representations capture the genuine similarities and differences among instances. The model's proficiency in individual instance assignment (as shown by Acc) and its capability to determine if pairs of instances should be in the same or different clusters (as indicated by ARI) emphasize the depth and quality of HyperRep's representations. Moreover, the strong NMI result indicates HyperRep's ability to understand the overall clustering structure. A high NMI suggests that our model is not only good at representation learning but also effectively retains the general structure and distribution of data clusters. In summary, HyperRep performs well in both representation learning and clustering tasks.

# 4.2 ABLATION STUDIES

To better understand the contributions of various components in our proposed HyperRep model, we conduct ablation studies as shown in Table 3. By removing each component in turn and observing the resulting performance, we can estimate the impact of each component on the overall effectiveness of the model. Due to space limitations, two additional ablation studies are presented in Appendix H.

Table 3: Experiment results of ablation studies.

Ablation study of high-order correlations. We substitute the modality hypergraph incidence matrix with the identity matrix. This modification transforms the process of propagating information from vertices to modality hyperedges into a linear layer operation. Consequently, the high-order structure intrinsic to each modality is ablated. However, we cannot ablate the instance hypergraph, i.e., the high-order cross-modality correlations, because the instance hyperedge representations are necessary for the clustering task. As depicted in Table 3, the full model outperforms this ablation by an average of  $699\%$ ,  $126.6\%$ , and  $142.7\%$  on AVE, MSR-VTT, and YouCook2, respectively. The removal of high-order correlations within modalities negatively affects the model's performance. This suggests that these high-order correlations play a crucial role in multimodal learning.

Ablation study of MFB loss. We modify the MFB loss function to become equivalent to the InfoNCE loss by setting the hyper-parameter  $\beta = 0$  in Eq. 14. Therefore, the model is optimized solely by maximizing the mutual information within each modality, without the constraint of focusing on cross-modal shared information. This implies that the learned representations could be influenced by modality-specific, instance-irrelevant features. The experimental results support this claim. The full model outperforms this ablation by an average of  $0.8\%$ ,  $3.4\%$ , and  $2.6\%$  on the AVE, MSR-VTT, and YouCook2 datasets, respectively. This suggests that constraining the solution space of the representation helps focus on cross-modal shared information, thus enhancing performance.

Table 2: Comparison of text-to-video retrieval systems on the MSR-VTT dataset. The modalities are represented by V for video, A for audio, and T for text. TR indicates if a trainable backbone is used or not.

Ablation study of modality. Lastly, we perform ablation experiments by omitting each modality in turn. Given that our method requires multimodal input, we cannot carry out this ablation on the AVE dataset, which only comprises two modalities. Instead, we exclude the video, audio, and text modalities individually on the MSR-VTT and YouCook2 datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that performance improves when all three modalities are included, as compared to when only two are used, indicating that each modality contributes significantly.

# 4.3 EXPERIMENTS ON MORE DOWNSSTREAM TASKS

In this section, we provide more experiments to demonstrate the adaptability and scalability of HyperRep across various downstream tasks.

# 4.3.1 EXPERIMENTS ON TEXT-TO-VIDEO RETRIEVAL TASK

Dataset and metric. We conduct text-to-video retrieval experiments on the MSR-VTT (Microsoft Research Video to Text) dataset Xu et al. (2016). The primary objective is to identify videos that best match a given text description. To evaluate performance, we employ the Recall@k metric, which measures whether the target video appears within the top-k most similar videos for a given text. Implementation details is provided in Appendix G.

Baselines. Following MCN Chen et al. (2021), we evaluate our approach against seven state-of-the-art method, which are Miech Miech et al. (2019), MDR Amrani et al. (2021), MIL-NCE Miech et al. (2020), ActBERT Zhu & Yang (2020), SSB Patrick et al. (2021), MMV FAC Alayrac et al. (2020) and MCN Chen et al. (2021). The duplicate methods in the table use different backbones.

Experimental results. As illustrated in Table 2, our approach consistently outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods. When compared to the second-best method, MCN, we observe improvements of  $10.5\%$ ,  $4.4\%$ , and  $10.4\%$  in  $\text{Recall} @ 1$ ,  $\text{Recall} @ 5$ , and  $\text{Recall} @ 10$ , respectively. These performance gains are attested to the efficacy of our multi-modal representation learning approach. By bridging the semantic gap between different modalities, our method ensures that the learned representations encapsulate richer and more comprehensive information. This nuanced understanding is evident as our approach excels at aligning textual descriptions with their corresponding video narratives—a critical capability in real-world applications where users use textual queries to search for relevant video content. Furthermore, the significant lead in  $\text{Recall} @ 1$  underscores our model's precision in identifying the most pertinent video based on a textual description. Such accuracy in retrieval tasks emphasizes the superiority and robustness of the multi-modal representations we've learned, which subsequently enhances user satisfaction in retrieval systems. The qualitative analysis is provided in Appendix K.

# 4.3.2 EXPERIMENTS ON TEMPORAL ACTION LOCALIZATION TASK

Dataset and metric We perform temporal action localization experiments using the CrossTask dataset Zhukov et al. (2019). Each video is segmented into a series of 1-second clips and is accompanied by an unordered set of action labels. The challenge lies in accurately associating each clip with its corresponding action label. The effectiveness of the model is quantified using Recall, which is calculated as the proportion of clips correctly labeled out of the total number of clips in the video. Implementation details is provided in Appendix G.

Baselines. Following MCN Chen et al. (2021), we evaluate our approach against five state-of-the-art method, which are CrossTask Zhukov et al. (2019), Miech Miech et al. (2019), MIL-NCE Miech et al. (2020), ActBERT Zhu & Yang (2020), and MCN Chen et al. (2021). The duplicate methods in the table use different backbones.

Table 4: Comparison of temporal action localization systems on the CrossTask dataset.  

<table><tr><td>Method</td><td>Modality</td><td>Model</td><td>TR</td><td>Recall</td></tr><tr><td>CrossTask</td><td>VT</td><td>R152+I3D</td><td>N</td><td>31.6</td></tr><tr><td>Miech</td><td>VT</td><td>R152+RX101</td><td>N</td><td>33.6</td></tr><tr><td>MIL-NCE*</td><td>VT</td><td>R152+RX101</td><td>N</td><td>33.2</td></tr><tr><td>MCN</td><td>VAT</td><td>R152+RX101</td><td>N</td><td>35.1</td></tr><tr><td>ActBERT</td><td>VT</td><td>R101+Res3D</td><td>N</td><td>37.1</td></tr><tr><td>ActBERT</td><td>VT</td><td>+ Faster R-CNN</td><td>N</td><td>41.4</td></tr><tr><td>MIL-NCE</td><td>VT</td><td>I3D-G</td><td>Y</td><td>36.4</td></tr><tr><td>MIL-NCE</td><td>VT</td><td>S3D-G</td><td>Y</td><td>40.5</td></tr><tr><td>HyperRep</td><td>VAT</td><td>R152+I3D</td><td>N</td><td>50.68</td></tr></table>

Experimental results. Critically analyzing the results presented in Table 4, our method has set a new benchmark in performance. Notably, we exceed the second-best performance of ActBERT by  $22.4\%$  in Recall. This is particularly impressive given that ActBERT utilizes additional feature modalities and a more advanced language model, while we predominantly draw from the standard features provided by CrossTask. It emphasizes the ability of HyperRep to unearth and exploit the latent semantic structures across modalities.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this study, we proposed HyperRep, a hypergraph-based method for self-supervised multimodal representation learning. Our model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and datasets, highlighting its proficiency in learning distinct and meaningful representations. The ablation studies further underlined the significance of high-order correlations, the multimodal fusion information bottleneck constraints, and the valuable contribution of each modality in multimodal learning. Moving forward, we believe that the foundational principles of HyperRep can be extended to a broader range of multimodal applications, setting a new benchmark for future research in this domain.
