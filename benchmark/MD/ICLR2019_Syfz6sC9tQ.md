# ABSTRACT

We propose a non-adversarial feature matching-based approach to train generative models. Our approach, Generative Feature Matching Networks (GFMN), leverages pretrained neural networks such as autoencoders and ConvNet classifiers to perform feature extraction. We perform an extensive number of experiments with different challenging datasets, includingImagenet. Our experimental results demonstrate that, due to the expressiveness of the features from pretrainedImagenet classifiers, even by just matching first order statistics, our approach can achieve state-of-the-art results for challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR10 and STL10.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

One of the key research focus in unsupervised learning is the training of generative methods that can model the observed data distribution. Good progress has been made in recent years with the advent of new approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and variational autoencoders (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013) which use deep neural networks as building blocks. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and a significant number of recent works focus on addressing their issues (Radford et al., 2016; Salimans et al., 2016; Kingma et al., 2016; Arjovsky et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018). While the main disadvantage of VAEs is the generation of blurred images, the main issue with GANs is the training instability due to the adversarial learning.

Feature matching has been explored to improve the stability of GANs (Salimans et al., 2016; Warde-Farley & Bengio, 2017). The key idea in feature matching GANs (FM-GANs) is to use the discriminator network as a feature extractor, and guide the generator to generate data that matches the feature statistics of the real data. Concretely, the objective function of the generator in FM-GAN consists in minimizing the mean squared error of the average features of a minibatch of generated data and a minibatch of real data. The features are extracted from one single layer of the discriminator. FM-GAN is somewhat similar to methods that use maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) (Gretton et al., 2006; 2012). However, while in FM-GAN the objective is to match the mean of the extracted features, in MMD-based generative models (Li et al., 2015; Dziugaite et al., 2015), one normally aims to match all the moments of the two distributions using a Gaussian kernel. Although MMD-based generative models have strong theoretical guarantees, these models normally perform much worse than GANs on challenging benchmarks (Li et al., 2017).

In this work, we focus on answering the following research question: can we train a generative model by performing feature matching on features extracted from a pretrained neural network? In other words, we would like to know if adversarial training of the feature extractor together with the generator is a requirement for training effective generators. Towards answering this question, we propose Generative Feature Matching Networks (GFMN), a new feature matching-based approach to train generative models that uses features from pretrained neural networks. Some interesting properties of the proposed method include: (1) the loss function is directly correlated to the generated image quality; (2) mode collapsing in not an issue; (3) the same pretrained feature extractor can be used across different datasets; and (4) both supervised (classifiers) and unsupervised (autoencoder) models can be used as feature extractors.

We perform an extensive number of experiments with different challenging datasets, including ILSVRC2012 (henceforth Imagenet) (Russakovsky et al., 2015). We demonstrate that, due to the expressiveness of the features from pretrained Imagenet classifiers, even by just matching first order statistics, our approach can achieve state-of-the-art results for challenging benchmarks such as

CIFAR10 and STL10. Moreover, we show that the same feature extractor is effective across different datasets. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a new effective feature matching-based approach to train generative models that does not use adversarial learning, have stable training and achieves state-of-the-art results; (2) We propose an ADAM-based moving average method that allows effective training with small minibatches; (3) Our extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that pretrained autoencoders and DCNN classifiers can be effectively used as feature extractors for the purpose of learning generative models.

# 2 GENERATIVE FEATURE MATCHING NETWORKS

# 2.1 THE METHOD

Let  $G$  be the generator implemented as a neural network with parameters  $\theta$ , and let  $E$  be a pretrained neural network with  $L$  hidden layers. Our proposed approach consists in training  $G$  by minimizing the following loss function:

$$
\min  _ {\theta} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {M} \left| \left| \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim p _ {d a t a}} E _ {j} (x) - \mathbb {E} _ {z \sim \mathcal {N} \left(0, I _ {n _ {z}}\right)} E _ {j} (G (z; \theta)) \right| \right| ^ {2} \tag {1}
$$

where:  $||.||^2$  is the  $L_{2}$  loss;  $x$  is a real data point sampled from the data generating distribution  $p_{data}$ ;  $z \in \mathbb{R}^{n_z}$  is a noise vector sampled from the normal distribution  $\mathcal{N}(0, I_{n_z})$ ;  $E_j(x)$ , denotes the output vector/feature map of the hidden layer  $j$  from  $E$ ;  $M \leq L$  is the number of hidden layers used to perform feature matching.

In practice, we train  $G$  by sampling mini-batches of true data and generated (fake) data and optimizing the parameters  $\theta$  using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation. The network  $E$  is used for the purpose of feature extraction only and is kept fixed during the training of  $G$ .

# 2.2 AUTOENCODER FEATURES

A natural choice of unsupervised method to train a feature extractor is the autoencoder framework. The decoder part of an AE consists exactly in an image generator that uses features extracted by the encoder. Therefore, by design, the encoder network should be a good feature extractor for the purpose of generation.

Let  $E$  and  $D$  be the encoder and the decoder networks with parameters  $\phi$  and  $\psi$ , respectively. We pretrain the autoencoder using mean squared error (MSE):

$$
\min _ {\phi , \psi} \mathbb {E} _ {p _ {d a t a}} | | x - D (E (x; \phi); \psi) | | ^ {2}
$$

or the Laplacian pyramid loss (Ling & Okada, 2006):

$$
\operatorname {L a p} _ {1} (x, x ^ {\prime}) = \sum_ {j} 2 ^ {- 2 j} \left| L ^ {j} (x) - L ^ {j} \left(x ^ {\prime}\right) \right| _ {1}
$$

where  $L^{j}(x)$  is the  $j$ -th level of the Laplacian pyramid representation of  $x$ . The Laplacian pyramid loss provides better signal for learning the high frequencies of the images and overcome some of the known issues of the blurry images that one would get with a simple MSE loss. Bojanowski et al. (2018) recently demonstrated that the  $\mathrm{Lap}_1$  loss produces better results than  $L_{2}$  loss for both auto-encoders and generative models.

Another attractive feature of the autoencoder framework is that the decoder network can be used to initialize the parameters of the generator, which can make the training of the generator easier by starting in a region closer to the data manifold. We use this option in our experiments and show that it leads to significantly better results.

# 2.3 CLASSIFIER FEATURES

Different past work have shown the usefulness and power of the features extracted from deep convolutional nets (DCNNs) pretrained on classification tasks (Yosinski et al., 2014). In particular, features from DCNNs pretrained on ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) have demonstrated an incredible value for a different number of tasks. In this work, we perform experiments where we use

different DCCNs pretrained on Imagenet to play the role of the feature extractor  $E$ . Our hypothesis is that Imagenet-based features are powerful enough to allow the successful training of (cross-domain) generators by feature matching.

# 2.4 MATCHING FEATURES WITH ADAM MOVING AVERAGE

In order to train with the feature matching loss, one would need big mini-batches which would result in slowing down the training. We propose instead to keep a moving average of the means on real and generated data. One way of implementing the moving average would be by replacing the loss given in Equation equation 1 by:

$$
\min  _ {\theta} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {M} v _ {j} ^ {\top} \left(\frac {1}{N} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {N} E _ {j} \left(x _ {k}\right) - \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {N} E _ {j} \left(G \left(z _ {k}; \theta\right)\right)\right) \tag {2}
$$

where  $v_{j}$  is a moving average on  $\Delta_j$ , the difference of the means of the features extracted by the  $j$ -th layer of  $E$ :  $\Delta_j = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N E_j(x_k) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N E_j(G(z_k;\theta))$ . Hence we have the following update on  $v_{j}$ , with a rate  $\alpha$ :

$$
v _ {j, \mathrm {n e w}} = (1 - \alpha) * v _ {j, \mathrm {o l d}} + \alpha * \Delta_ {j}, \forall j = 1 \dots M
$$

Note that the moving average is a gradient descent update on the following loss:

$$
\min  _ {v _ {j}} \frac {1}{2} \left\| v _ {j} - \Delta_ {j} \right\| ^ {2}, \tag {3}
$$

hence, writing the gradient update with learning rate  $\alpha$  we have:

$$
v _ {j, \text {n e w}} = v _ {j, \text {o l d}} - \alpha * \left(v _ {j, \text {o l d}} - \Delta_ {j}\right) = (1 - \alpha) v _ {j, \text {o l d}} + \alpha * \Delta_ {j}.
$$

With this interpretation of the moving average we propose to get a better estimate of the moving average using the Adam optimizer Kingma & Ba (2015) on the loss of the moving average given in Equation equation 3, i.e:

$$
v _ {j, \text {n e w}} = v _ {j, \text {o l d}} - \alpha A D A M \left(\left(v _ {j, \text {o l d}} - \Delta_ {j}\right)\right)
$$

This moving average formulation allows us to use small mini-batches and provides better results.

# 3 RELATED WORK

Features from deep convolutional neural nets (DCNN) pretrained on ImageNet have been used frequently to perform transfer learning in many computer vision tasks (Huh et al., 2016). Some previous work have also used DCNN features in the context of image generation and transformation. Dosovitskiy & Brox (2016) combines feature based loss with adversarial loss to improve image quality of variational autoencoders (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013). Johnson et al. (2016) proposes a feature based loss that uses features from different layers of the VGG-16 neural network and is effective for image transformation task such as style transfer and super-resolution. Johnson et al. (2016) confirms the findings of Mahendran & Vedaldi (2015) that the initial layers of the network are more related to content while the last layers are more related to style.

Our proposed approach is closely related to the recent body of work on MMD-based generative models (Li et al., 2015; Dziugaite et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; Bikowski et al., 2018; Ravuri et al., 2018). In fact, our method is a type of MMD where we (only) match the first moment of the transformed data. Among the approaches reported in the literature, the closest to our method is the Generative Moment Matching Network + Autoencoder (GMMN+AE) proposed by Li et al. (2015). In GMMN+AE, the objective is to train a generator  $G$  that maps from a prior uniform distribution to the latent code learned by a pretrained AE. To generate a new image, one sample a noise vector  $z$  from the prior, maps it the AE latent space using  $G$ , then use the (frozen) decoder to map from the AE latent space to the image space. One key difference in our approach is that our generator  $G$  maps from the  $z$  space directly to the data space, such as in GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Additionally the dimensionality of the feature space that we use to perform distribution matching is orders of magnitude larger than the dimensionality of the latent code normally used in GMMN+AE. (Li et al., 2017) demonstrate that GMMN+AE is not competitive with GANs for challenging datasets such as CIFAR10. Recent MMD-based generative models have demonstrated state-of-the-art results with the

use of adversarial learning to train the MMD kernel as a replacement of the fixed Gaussian kernel in GMMN (Li et al., 2017; Bikowski et al., 2018). Additionally, Ravuri et al. (2018) recently proposed a method to perform online learning of the moments while training the generator. Our proposed method differs from these previous approaches where we use a frozen pretrained feature extractor to perform moment matching.

Bojanowski et al. (2018) proposed the GLO model, a generative approach that jointly optimizes the model parameters and the noise input vectors  $z$ . Bojanowski et al. (2018) obtain competitive results for CelebA and LSUN datasets without using adversarial training. Bojanowski et al. (2018) also demonstrated that the Laplacian pyramid loss is an effective way to improve the performance of non-adversarial methods that use reconstruction loss. Our work relates also to plug and play generative models of Nguyen et al. (2017) where a pre-trained classifier is used to sample new images, using MCMC sampling methods.

Our work is also related to AE-based generative models variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013), adversarial autoencoder (AAE) (Makhzani et al., 2016) and Wasserstein autoencoder (WAE) (Tolstikhin et al., 2018). While in VAE and WAE a penalty is used to impose a prior distribution on the hidden code vector of the AE, in AAE an adversarial training procedure is used for that purpose. In our method, the aim is to get a generative model out of a pretrained autoencoder. We fix the pretrained encoder to be the discriminator in a GAN like setting.

Another recent line of work that involves the use of AEs in generative models consists in applying AEs to improve GANs stability. Zhao et al. (2017) proposed an energy based approach where the discriminator is replaced by an autoencoder. (Warde-Farley & Bengio, 2017) augments the training loss of the GAN generator by including a feature reconstruction loss term that is computed as the mean squared error of a set of features extracted by the discriminator and their reconstructed version. The reconstruction is performed using an AE trained on the features extracted by the discriminator for the real data.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Datasets: We evaluate our proposed approach on MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) (60k training, 10k test images, 10 classes), CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) (50k training, 10k test images, 10 classes), STL10 (Coates et al., 2011) (5K training, 8k test images, 100k unlabeled, 10 classes), CelebA (Liu et al., 2015) (200k images) and different portions ofImagenet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) datasets. MNIST and STL10 images are rescaled to  $32 \times 32$ , while CelebA andImagenet images are rescaled to  $64 \times 64$ . CelebA images are center cropped to  $160 \times 160$  before rescaling.

GFMN Generator: In our experiments with all datasets but Imagenet, our generator  $G$  uses a DCGAN like architecture (Radford et al., 2016). For CIFAR10, STL10 and CelebA, we use two extra layers as commonly used in previous works (Mroueh & Sercu, 2017; Gulrajani et al., 2017). For Imagenet, we use a Resnet-based generator such as the one in (Miyato et al., 2018). More details about the architectures can be found in Appendix A.2.

Autoencoder Features: For most AE experiments, we use an encoder network whose architecture is similar to the discriminator in DCGAN (strided convolutions). We use batch normalization and ReLU non-linearity after each convolution. We set the latent code size as 8, 128, 128, and 512 for MNIST, CIFAR10, STL10 and CelebA, respectively. To perform feature extraction, we get the output of each ReLU in the network as well as the output of the very last layer, the latent code. Additionally, we also perform some experiments where the encoder uses a VGG13 architecture. The decoder network  $D$  uses a network architecture similar to our generator  $G$ . More details in Appendix A.2.

Classifier Features: We perform our experiments on classifier features with VGG19 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) and Resnet18 networks (He et al., 2016) which we pretrained using the whole Imagenet dataset with 1000 classes. More details about the pretrained Imagenet classifiers can be found in Appendices A.2 and A.3.

GFMN Training: We train GFMN with ADAM optimizer and keep most of the hyperparameters fixed for the different datasets. We use  $n_z = 100$  and minibatch size 64. When using autoencoder

features, we set the learning rate to  $5 \times 10^{-6}$  when  $G$  is initialized with  $D$ , and to  $5 \times 10^{-5}$  when it is not. When using features from Imagenet classifiers, we set the learning rate to  $1 \times 10^{-4}$ . We use ADAM moving average (Sec. 2.4) in all reported experiments.

# 4.2.1 AUTOENCODER FEATURES AND GENERATOR INITIALIZATION

In this section we present experimental results on the use of pretrained encoders as feature extractors. The first two rows of results in Tab. 1 show GFMN performance in terms of Inception Score (IS) (Salimans et al., 2016) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017) for CIFAR10 in the case where the (DCGAN-like) encoder is used as feature extractor. The use of a pretrained decoder  $D$  to initialize the generator gives a significant boost in both IS and FID. A visual comparison that corroborates the quantitative results can be found in Appendix A.5. In Figs. 1a, 1b and 1c, we present random samples generated by GFMN when trained with MNIST, CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets, respectively. For each dataset, we train its respective AE using the (unlabeled) training set.

# 4.2.2 (CROSS-DOMAIN) CLASSIFIER FEATURES

The last six rows in Tab. 1 present the IS and FID for our best configurations that use Imagenet pretrained VGG19 and Resnet18 as feature extractors. We can see that there is a large boost in performance when Imagenet classifiers are used as feature extractors instead of autoencoders. Despite the classifiers are trained in data from a different domain (Imagenet vs. CIFAR10), the classifier features are significantly more effective. In all cases, the use of initialized generator improves the results. However, the improvements are much less significant when compared to the one obtained for the encoder feature extractor. We perform an additional experiment where we use simultaneously VGG19 and Resnet18 as feature extractors, which increases the number of features to 832K. This last configuration gives the best performance for both CIFAR10 and STL10. Figures 2b and 2c show random samples from the GFMN $^{VGG19+Resnet18}$  model, where no init. of the generator is used.

(f) CIFAR10 (9 layers)

In Tab. 2, we report IS and FID for increasing number of layers (i.e. number of features) in our extractors VGG19 and Resnet18. We select up to 16 layers for VGG19 and 17 layers for Resnet18, which means that we excluded the output of fully connected layers. Using more layers dramatically improves the performance of both feature extractors, reaching (IS) peak performance when the maximum number of layers is used. The results in Tab. 1 are better than the ones in Tab. 2 because, for the former, we trained the models for a longer number of epochs. All models in Tab. 2 are trained for 391K generator updates, while VGG19 and Resnet18 models in Tab. 1 are trained for 1.17M updates (we use small learnin rates). Note that for both feature extractors, the features are ReLU activation outputs. As a result, the encodings may be quiet sparse. Figs. 2d, 2e and 2f show generated images when 1, 3, and 9 layers are used for feature matching, respectively (More in Appendix A.7).

In order to check if the number of features is the main factor for the performance, we performed an experiment where we trained an autoencoder whose encoder network uses a VGG13 architecture. This encoder produces a total of 244K features. We pretrained the autoencoder we both CIFAR10 andImagenet datasets, so that we can also compare the impact of the autoencoder training set size. The results for this experiment are in the 3rd and 4th rows of Tab. 1 (Encoder (VGG13)). Although there is some improvement on both IS and FID, specially when using the Encoder pretrained withImagenet, the boost is not comparable with the one obtained by using a VGG19 classifier. In other words, features from classifiers are significantly more informative than autoencoder features for the purpose of training generators by feature matching.

# 4.2.3 TRAINING STABILITY AND ADAM MOVING AVERAGE

A key contribution in this work is the introduction of the ADAM-based moving average, which allows a stable training when using small minibatches. In Fig. 3 we show a visual comparison of generated samples from GFMN when using regular moving average vs. ADAM moving average, in the three cases the minibatch size is 64. Regular moving average leads to poor results with both AE features and classifier features. When using AE features, the training with the reg. mov. average is even more challenging and the quality of generated images tends to degrade quickly over few training epochs. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the generator loss per epoch with some generated examples for

# 4.2.4 IMAGENET EXPERIMENTS

In order to evaluate the performance of GFMN for an even more challenging dataset, we trained  $\mathrm{GFMN}^{VGG19}$  with different portions of the Imagenet dataset. Fig. 5a shows some (cherry picked) images generated by  $\mathrm{GFMN}^{VGG19}$  trained on the Imagenet subset that contains different dogs breeds (same as used in Zhao et al. (2017)). The results are quite impressive given that we perform unconditional generation. Fig. 5b presents (randomly sampled) images generated by  $\mathrm{GFMN}^{VGG19}$  trained with the Daisy portion of Imagenet. More results can be found in Appendix A.1.

# 4.2.5 COMPARISON WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES

In Tab. 3, we compare GFMN results with different adversarial and non-adversarial approaches for CIFAR10 and STL10. The table includes results for recent models that, like ours, use a DCGAN-like (or CNN) architecture in the generator. Despite using a frozen cross-domain feature extractor, GFMN outperforms the other systems in terms of FID for both datasets, and achieves the best IS for CIFAR10.

(b) Daisy

We performed additional experiments with a WGAN-GP architecture where: (1) the discriminator is a VGG19 or a Resnet18; (2) the discriminator is pretrained onImagenet; (3) the generator is pretrained on CIFAR10 through autoencoding. The objective of the experiment is to evaluate if WGAN-GP can benefit from DCNN classifiers pretrained onImagenet. Although we tried different hyperparameter combinations, we were not able to successfully train WGAN-GP with VGG19 or Resnet18 discriminators. More details about this experiment in Appendix A.8.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this work, we introduced Generative Feature Matching Networks, an effective non-adversarial approach to train generative models. GFMNs are demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art results

while avoiding the challenge of defining and training an adversarial discriminator. Our feature extractors can be easily obtained and provide for a robust and stable training of our generators. Some interesting open questions include: what type of feature extractors other than classifiers and auto-encoders are good for GFMN? What architecture designs are better suited for the purpose of feature extraction in GFMN?
