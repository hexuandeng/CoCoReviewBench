# ABSTRACT

Humans can use natural languages compositionally, where complicated concepts are expressed using expressions grounded in simpler concepts. Hence, it has been argued that compositionality increases the ability of generalization. This behavior is acquired during natural language learning. Natural languages contain a large number of compositional phrases that function as examples of how to construct compositional expressions for human learners. However, in language emergence, neural agents do not have access to such compositional language expressions. It can be circumvent by optimizing a suitably devised metric of compositionality, which does not require supervising examples. In this paper, we present a learning environment where agents are pressured to make their emerging languages compositional by incorporating a metric of topological similarity into the loss function. We observe that when this pressure is carefully adjusted, agents can achieve higher generalizations. The optimal level of this pressure is highly dependent on the agent architecture, input, and structure of the message space. However, we find no simple correlation between high compositionality and generalization. The advantage offered by compositional pressure is situational. We observe instances where moderately compositional languages are showing generalizing behavior to the extent of some highly compositional ones.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Traditional language processing methods expose neural networks to large amounts of textual examples to build statistical relationships. This has been an enormous success in many areas. However, grounding of language and capturing of functional aspects achieved by such methods are questionable (Ren et al., 2020; Lazaridou et al., 2016; Mordatch & Abbeel, 2018; Lazaridou et al., 2018). Language emergence provides an exciting alternative to supervised approaches, where neural agents separated by a communication link develop their language skills grounded in experience, starting from scratch. In these game environments, agents engage in some non-linguistical tasks. The environment is partially observable, such that specific agents are unable to complete their tasks without gaining information from their peers (Jorge et al., 2016). Hence, they should develop their own language to acquire information on what they are unable to observe.

Several key factors in language emergence have recently drawn significant attention. Among these, the compositionality of emergent languages holds an exciting place. It is still in debate whether compositionality is an essential or a desired property. The simple reason for favoring compositionality is that it enables expressing complex concepts by means of simpler ones, implying a higher degree of generalization. Moreover, there is strong evidence (Kirby & Hurford, 2002; Kirby et al., 2014; 2015) citing this property as advantageous for language acquisition. Such ideas and proposals have led several studies to promote compositionality as a required attribute in language emergence (Ren et al., 2020; Lazaridou et al., 2018). Nevertheless, some others (Chaabouni et al., 2020) have shown empirical evidence that, for the case of language emergence in neural agents, compositionality is not related to generalization.

(Chaabouni et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Resnick et al., 2019) have studied the relationship between compositionality and several other parameters like generalization, bandwidth and agent complexity. (Ren et al., 2020) propose a model based on the generational transmission that favors compositional languages. They demonstrate the learning speed advantages of compositional lan

guages and propose the existence of a strong correlation between compositionality and validation performance.

When humans learn natural languages, they have access to a plethora of examples containing compositionality. Such examples assist the new learner in getting an idea of how to formulate compositional expressions. Nevertheless, it is impossible to provide supervised guidance in language emergence. As a solution, a metric, which can measure compositionality without direct supervision, can be optimized via agents. Then, even in the absence of supervising samples, the agents will be pressured to make their messages compositional.

Usage of such functional pressures has been discussed in previous works. Natural languages possess a characteristic known as Zipf's Law of Abbreviation (Zipf, 2016). (Chaabouni et al., 2019) found that anti-efficient encoding is developed in emergent communications instead of complying with the Zipf law. Moreover, they show that when the cost function includes a penalty for longer messages, the message distributions start to show the characteristics described by the Zipf law. In a similar sense, (Lazaridou et al., 2016) study compositional obverter technique, stressing that what speaker agents are transmitting should also be understandable to themselves.

Being motivated by this, we introduce an environment where agents are externally pressured to optimize compositionality in their output messages. This is done by directly optimizing a compositionality metric within their joint loss function. This is in contrast to (Chaabouni et al., 2020) where there is no external pressure for agents to make their communications compositional. (Ren et al., 2020; Kirby & Hurford, 2002; Kirby et al., 2014; 2015) discuss cultural evolution of language and propose compositionality as stemming from iterated learning, where successive generations acquire language skills from the previous generations. We do not employ generational transmission similar to them, and our agents are pressured to acquire compositionality within the learning phase of a single life cycle.

We analyze whether applying such functional pressure is beneficial to the agents and how the agent behavior varies with the amount of applied pressure. As our metric, we use topological similarity between input and output messages. Our results show that by carefully adjusting compositional pressure, it is possible to get improved generalizations and convergence speeds. The optimal amount of pressure is correlated with the message space structure, input space and the architecture of the agents. Additionally, we observed that there is no simple correlation between compositionality and generalization in emergent communications. In some instances, moderately compositional languages display generalization levels comparable to highly compositional ones. Furthermore, excessive pressure can even degrade the test performance considerably. However, in general, well-tuned external pressure for compositionality give improved results results on average.

We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows,

- We introduce methods to externally influence neural agents for constructing compositional messages.  
- We observe that carefully tuned functional pressure for compositionality could increase both generalization and convergence speed of neural language emergence.  
- The level of optimal pressure is dependent on the agent architecture, input, and the message space structure.  
- There is no simple correlation between generalization and compositionality. Improvements due to compositionality are situational.

# 2 LANGUAGE EMERGENCE GAME

There are several frequent configurations in language emergence games, most of which are inspired by the Lewis signalling game (Lewis, 2008). (Sukhbaatar et al., 2016; Mordatch & Abbeel, 2018) used a simulating environment where multiple agents can navigate in a 2-D world while coordinating with each other by exchanging discrete symbols. (Lazaridou et al., 2016; Havrylov & Titov, 2017). (Havrylov & Titov, 2017; Evtimova et al., 2017; Jorge et al., 2016) employ a "discriminating" objective where one of the agents has to correctly identify a reference object apart from a set of distractors by listening to its peer who has a copy of the reference. (Kharitonov et al., 2020) propose

"classification" type game. In such variations speaker, who gets an image, transmits discrete signals to the receiver. The receiver then determines the class of the image referenced by the speaker. (Resnick et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2020) follows the "reconstruction" game setup, where Listener has to approximate the input given to the speaker. Discriminating, classification, and reconstruction games frequently but not always use a value attribute environment. In such environments, inputs consist of a set of abstract attributes, and each attribute can take a finite set of values. The whole dataset is a collection of abstract vectors, which are free from noise. Such data is easier to generate and the complexity of the dataset can be controlled by changing the number of attributes and values.

(Kharitonov et al., 2020; Bouchacourt & Baroni, 2018) discuss how agents can converge to a simpler protocol without capturing high-level features in a discrimination game. For example, if images are used, agents can use the average pixel intensities of the images to identify the correct image. In a value-attribute environment, such behaviors cause agents to have an excessive degree of freedom, where they map only a subset of inputs with messages. Achieving high performance is still possible if the complexity of the distractor set is low. Hence, the final accuracy may not directly indicate a rich communication protocol or a vocabulary. Therefore, in our work, we use the reconstruction objective (Resnick et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2020) to remove the possibility of such events.

# 2.1 SETUP

We create an abstract object  $x \in \mathbb{X}$  composed by a set of attributes  $a \in \mathbb{A}$  where each attribute takes a value  $v \in \mathbb{V}$ . We externally control the number of attributes  $|\mathbb{A}| = N_A$  and the number of values per attribute  $|\mathbb{V}| = N_V$ . Hence, the total objects in  $\mathbb{X}$  is  $|\mathbb{X}| = N_V^{N_A}$ . Inputs are represented as one-hot encoded vectors. In the game, Sender agent observes an object  $x$ , and transmit a discreet message  $m \in \mathbb{M}$  towards a Listener. After reading the message, Listener reconstruct an approximation  $x'$  for the original object.

To construct the message Sender repeatedly samples symbols or words  $w \in \mathbb{W}$  from a finite sized vocabulary with replacement, until the message reach length constraint. Similar to inputs, each symbols is represented in one-hot format. Then the whole message  $m$  is transmitted to the Listener. The maximum number of unique messages Speaker is able to construct, or the message space capacity  $|\mathbb{M}|$  is equal to  $|\mathbb{W}|^L$ . For convenience we denote the input spaces and message space as tuples, where  $X(V, A)$  and  $M(W, L)$  denoting data spaces with  $V$  values,  $A$  attributes and message spaces with vocabulary size  $W$  and message length  $L$ .

# 2.2 AGENTS

Our setup contains two agent players, Speaker and Listener similar to many previous works. Sender is modeled by a LSTM cell (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and two MLPs. First, the input  $x$  is fed to a linear layer, and the output vector is treated as the initial hidden state and the cell state of the LSTM cell. Next, the updated hidden state of the LSTM cell is mapped to a set of logits by the second linear layer. Then the logits are used to sample a symbol from the vocabulary with replacement, and the sampled symbol is fed back to the LSTM cell as input when sampling the next symbol.

We employ two types of networks, linear and recurrent, for modeling the Listener. The Sender's message is fed to the Listener as a whole. The output logits of the Listener are used to obtain a probability vector that spans over all the attributes. It indicates the value of each attribute that constitutes the input given to the Sender. We use backpropagation in our experiments and use Gumbel-Softmax (Jang et al., 2016) approximation to make discrete messages differentiable during the backward pass. We use cross-entropy loss between the Listener's output distribution and Sender's input to measure the reconstruction loss  $\mathcal{L}_r$ . The compositional loss  $\mathcal{L}_c$  is implemented only on the Sender, and it is added on top of the reconstruction loss for backpropagation (see Algorithm 1).

Matrices  $\mathbf{A}$  and  $\mathbf{B}$  in algorithm 1 are used to create the pairwise formations, which solely depends on the batch size. For inputs  $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, \ldots, x_{n}$ , there should be  $(n(n - 1)) / 2$  pairs  $: (x_{1}, x_{2}), (x_{1}, x_{3}), (x_{1}, x_{4}), \ldots, (x_{n - 1}, x_{n})$ , depicting all possible paring arrangements. For inputs of batch size  $n$ ,  $A x_{n}$  and  $B x_{n}$  yields paring vectors, which denotes elements at the first position  $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n - 1}$  and second position  $x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots, x_{n}$  of all the pairs.

# 3 PRESSURE FOR COMPOSITIONALITY

# 3.1 METRICS FOR COMPOSITIONALITY

There has been much debate about how to measure compositionality. Although there is no universally agreed method, several studies have proposed a set of valuable metrics. (Chaabouni et al., 2020), includes a measure based on topological similarity and two other intuitive measures of disentanglement, such as positional disentanglement and bag of words disentanglement. Despite having multiple intuitively plausible alternatives, metrics depending on topological similarity have been more widely used (Brighton & Kirby, 2006; Ren et al., 2020; Lazaridou et al., 2018). Consequently, we use topological similarity in all of our experiments. We first obtain all pairwise combinations of the inputs and their corresponding messages through a paring operation defined by two matrices. Next, according to a distance measure, we obtain the distance between inputs within each pair. Similarly, corresponding distances of the message pairs are also calculated. Finally, a measure representing topological similarity is obtained by taking the correlation between these two groups of distance values.

We do not directly use Sender's inputs and messages in our method. Instead, we use the initial hidden state of the Sender, and samples from the relaxed categorical distribution (see Algorithm 1). We use cosine similarity (Lazaridou et al., 2018) to measure the similarity  $\cos(i,j)$  between elements in

each pair. Since the maximum value of cosine distance is equal to one, we consider  $d(i,j) = 1 - \cos (i,j)$  as the distance. Finally, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient  $\rho_{h_0,m}$  between distance vectors of inputs and messages (see Algorithm 1) as an indicator for topological similarity. If the Spearman coefficient is used, its monotonicity is less restrictive than the requirements for a linear relationship in the Pearson correlation coefficient. However, Pearson correlation can be implemented as a differentiable metric, which releases the burden of implementing a differentiable approximation for the ranking operation required by the Spearman correlation.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We conduct our experiments as an ablation study to test the advantage of compositional pressure against the baseline performance. Unless stated, each experiment was repeated six times with different random seeds (1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13). Input space, defined by the value and attribute parameters, is partitioned into train and test subspaces. During the training and testing phases, samples are drawn randomly from the corresponding partitions. We train agents using mini-batch training, with a batch size of 64. During each epoch, agents are exposed to examples up to five times the size of the input space. We use a learning rate of 0.01 and conduct training for 100 epochs. We do not thrive on chasing high test accuracy, as our main intention is to find empirical evidence to determine the effect of compositional pressure. We use  $65\%$  of data for training and the rest for testing.

# 4.1 GENERALIZATION

We conducted our experiments with both recurrent and linear architectures for the Listener, while the Sender was always kept as a recurrent model. First, we use a value attribute environment of  $X(50,2)$ , giving 2500 unique examples. Figure 1 plots test accuracy against the number of epochs under six different message space structures. For each configuration, we conduct four experiments by varying the pressure constant  $C_t$ .

It is evident from the plots that there is no clear winner for  $C_t$ , which is suitable for all the scenarios. For message space structures  $M(10,4)$  and  $M(10,6)$ , there is a improvement of  $17.4\%$  and  $12.2\%$  in test accuracy. Surprisingly, all experiments with external pressure, fails to outperform the baseline at the  $M(50,2)$ , where  $|\mathbb{M}| = |\mathbb{X}|$ . Such cases denote that generalization can be worse

than the baseline performance if a pressure that is not matching with the environment is applied to the agents. A relating behavior is reported in (Chaabouni et al., 2019), they incorporate a message length regularizing term to the loss function, which causes emergent messages to follow Zipf's law more strictly. However, they noticed slower convergence by adding this term, with a lesser number of successful runs. Section 4.3 further discuss this issue. Nevertheless, graphs still demonstrate that compositional pressure is advantageous when carefully matched with other environmental parameters like input space and message space.

# 4.2 COMPOSITIONALITY

Figure 2 display the variation of the topological similarity against the number of epochs. According to the trends, maintaining  $C_t$  at higher levels leads to high compositional communications at most of the instances. Baseline method at  $C_t = 0$  yield languages with  $\rho$  values in a range of 0.5-0.7, where  $C_t$  of 0.1 and 1 giving results greater than 0.8 and 0.9. Languages with high topological similarities are easier to acquire by new learners (Kirby & Hurford, 2002; Ren et al., 2020). Despite that, there is no mandate for high compositional pressures always to yield better generalizations, as evident by cases for  $M(50,2)$  and  $M(100,2)$ , where agents give the highest test accuracy when trained with low pressures. If intuitively argued, such behaviour occurs when agents stop optimizing the cross entropy loss of the primary reconstruction objective. Other popular regularizing techniques such as weight decay (Krogh & Hertz, 1992) and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) have similar functionalities. If the decay coefficient or the optimal probability of retention is too large, the training does not converge.

# 4.3 EFFECT OFMESSAGE SPACE STRUCTURE

Observations suggest that stronger pressures are favored when agents have smaller vocabularies. This behavior is intuitively consistent with the measure of topographic similarity. Symbols in a vocabulary do not have any inherent ordering, and should be considered as values in a nominal scale. Hence, the edit distance  $d(i,j) = 1$  if  $i \neq j$ , else  $d(i,j) = 0$ . The same holds for the values and attributes in the inputs, where values for a given attribute are in the nominal scale. Hence, from a linguistic perspective, the upper bound of maximum distance  $d_{M}(i,j) = |\mathbb{A}|$  and  $d_{M}(i^{m},j^{m}) = L$ , where  $i^{m}$  and  $j^{m}$  are corresponding points in the message space.

When  $|\mathbb{W}| \gg |\mathbb{A}|$ , agents are free to map more than one attribute to a single position in a message. If we have two points  $i$  and  $j$  in the input space, with larger vocabularies agents can invent a mapping such that,  $d(i,j) > d(i^m,j^m)$ . If Listener can successfully map messages back into the input space, the latter phenomena will not always hinder performance. The higher degree of freedom allows agents to invent complex mappings that are not possible in constrained message spaces. Excessive compositional pressure will force agents to avoid this type of symbol usage, which is orthogonal to increasing the test accuracy at configurations where  $|\mathbb{W}| \gg |\mathbb{A}|$ . Smaller vocabularies cause agents to map inputs to messages with appropriate edit distances along a considerable message length. Hence, high compositional pressures are preferred with smaller vocabularies, which supports the latter behavior.

There is a notable exception at configuration  $M(50,2)$ , where compositional pressure fails to surpass the baseline model. At this configuration, size of the message space is equal to that of input space  $|\mathbb{M}| = |\mathbb{X}|$ . Previous studies (Gupta et al., 2020; Resnick et al., 2019; Chaabouni et al., 2019) have shown that agents require message space capacities strictly greater than the input space size to be successful in communication. Not surprisingly, it is the setting where agents achieve the lowest test performance across all chosen values for  $C_t$ . At such low capacities, agents do not have much freedom to choose mappings from inputs to messages because the message space is already tightly constrained. Intuitively there is not much to achieve by introducing an addition constrain through the topological similarity metric. It is not impossible for a lower  $C_t$  coefficient than  $10^6$  to give better performance than the existing values. However, we do not further investigate the existence of such a value in this work.

# 4.4 CONNECTION BETWEEN COMPOSITIONALITY PRESSURE AND GENERALIZATION

Figure 1, stresses that amount of advantage offered by compositionality is not always the same, and it is dependent on a set of crucial environment parameters. We conduct three additional experiments to study whether the behavioral patterns shown in the last graph are generalizing.

First, we repeat the above experiments with a different input space. We use  $X(10,4)$ , which accounts for an input space with  $10^4$  distinct examples (see Table 1). The optimal values for  $C_t$  are different from the first experiment, signaling that the compositional pressure is dependent on the structure of the input data. The accuracy values are notably higher than in the first experiment. We assume increased number of data samples to be the reason behind the improved accuracy. In general, the previous relation between message space structure and coefficient  $C_t$  still holds, where smaller vocabularies favoring higher coefficients.

Here, baseline experiments perform on par with the models trained with optimized pressure, suggesting that having large amounts of training data is crucial for test accuracy, regardless of any functional pressure. To further verify this claim, we select the  $X(50,2)$  data set and conduct the experiment, with varying proportions of training data. We use  $C_t$  value of 0.1, which gave the best results in figure 1. The results are shown in table 3. Both methods have increased their test accuracy up to almost  $100\%$ . Models trained with optimal pressure gained slightly better results than the baseline models. Next, we replace the linear Listener with a recurrent model, parameterized by a single LSTM layer (see Table 2). We use the same value attribute configuration as in the first experiment (50, 2). Again the optimal values for pressure coefficient are different from the previous experiment, indicating that agent architecture affects the level of the optimal pressure.

Figure 2 indicates that models with large  $C_t$  may not always generalize above others. Unnecessarily pressuring agents towards compositionality can degrade the performance. For a overall evaluation, we select the experimental runs that converged to a training accuracy above 0.95. Then we extract the epoch which has the maximum test accuracy and plot it against test topological similarity (see Figure 3). There are two clusters of points, the cluster to the high end of horizontal axis represent experiments that conducted with  $C_t = 0.1, 0.5, 1$ . The other cluster represents  $C_t = 0, 10^{-6}, 10^{-4}$ . There is considerable amount of instances that achieve near perfect accuracy and having moderate test topological similarity. Overall distribution stresses there is no visible correlation between compositionality and generalization. However, there is more than enough evidence to accept situational advantage of the compositional pressure on generalization.

Our observations clarify that, some environment parameters have more effect on generalization than compositionality. Models that do not operate under functional pressure improves their results if other factors are correctly tuned. Compositional pressure works similar to some popular regularizing techniques, hence the amount of pressure it exerts should be carefully controlled. If controlled, considerable improvements can be achieved in a situational manner.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we investigate the effect of external pressure for compositionality on language emergence. We use the reconstruction setting and value attribute data for our environment. Compositional pressure is introduced to the loss function of the neural agents in the form of topological similarity. With our experiments, we show that external influence for compositionality can increase the generalizing behavior of agents when it is carefully controlled. Message space structure, input type, and agent architecture are crucial in determining the optimal pressure level. As a general rule stronger pressures are suitable for situations with smaller vocabularies. We also observed that higher compositionality is not mandatory for generalization, where moderately compositional languages are generalizing well in some instances. Nonetheless, we find strong empirical evidence to support the situational advantage of well tuned compositional pressure.
