# ABSTRACT

Reinforcement learning encounters many challenges when applied directly in the real world. Sim-to-real transfer is widely used to transfer the knowledge learned from simulation to the real world. Domain randomization—one of the most popular algorithms for sim-to-real transfer—has been demonstrated to be effective in various tasks in robotics and autonomous driving. Despite its empirical successes, theoretical understanding on why this simple algorithm works is largely missing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for sim-to-real transfers, in which the simulator is modeled as a set of MDPs with tunable parameters (corresponding to unknown physical parameters such as friction). We provide sharp bounds on the sim-to-real gap—the difference between the value of policy returned by domain randomization and the value of an optimal policy for the real world. We prove that sim-to-real transfer can succeed under mild conditions without any real-world training samples. Our theory also highlights the importance of using memory (i.e., history-dependent policies) in domain randomization. Our proof is based on novel techniques that reduce the problem of bounding the sim-to-real gap to the problem of designing efficient learning algorithms for infinite-horizon MDPs, which we believe are of independent interest.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is concerned with sequential decision making, in which the agent interacts with the environment to maximize its cumulative rewards. This framework has achieved tremendous empirical successes in various fields such as Atari games, Go and StarCraft (Mnih et al., 2013; Silver et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2019). However, state-of-the-art algorithms often require a large amount of training samples to achieve such a good performance. While feasible in applications that have a good simulator such as the examples above, these methods are limited in applications where interactions with the real environment are costly and risky, such as healthcare and robotics.

One solution to this challenge is sim-to-real transfer (Floreano et al., 2008; Kober et al., 2013). The basic idea is to train an RL agent in a simulator that approximates the real world and then transfer the trained agent to the real environment. This paradigm has been widely applied, especially in robotics (Rusu et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2018; Chebotar et al., 2019) and autonomous driving (Pouyanfar et al., 2019; Niu et al., 2021). Sim-to-real transfer is appealing as it provides an essentially unlimited amount of data to the agent, and reduces the costs and risks in training.

However, sim-to-real transfer faces the fundamental challenge that the policy trained in the simulated environment may have degenerated performance in the real world due to the sim-to-real gap—the mismatch between simulated and real environments. In addition to building higher-fidelity simulators to alleviate this gap, domain randomization is another popular method (Sadeghi & Levine, 2016; Tobin et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2018). Instead of training the agent in a single simulated environment, domain randomization randomizes the dynamics of the environment, thus exposes the agent to a diverse set of environments in the training phase. Policies learned entirely in the simulated environment with domain randomization can be directly transferred to the physical world with good performance (Sadeghi & Levine, 2016; Matas et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2018).

In this paper, we focus on understanding sim-to-real transfer and domain randomization from a theoretical perspective. The empirical successes raise the question: can we provide guarantees for the sub-optimality gap of the policy that is trained in a simulator with domain randomization

and directly transferred to the physical world? To do so, we formulate the simulator as a set of MDPs with tunable latent variables, which corresponds to unknown parameters such as friction coefficient or wind velocity in the real physical world. We model the training process with domain randomization as finding an optimal history-dependent policy for a latent MDP, in which an MDP is randomly drawn from a set of MDPs in the simulator at the beginning of each episode.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

- We propose a novel formulation of sim-to-real transfer and establish the connection between domain randomization and the latent MDP model (Kwon et al., 2021). The latent MDP model illustrates the uniform sampling nature of domain randomization, and helps to analyze the sim-to-real gap for the policy obtained from domain randomization.  
- We study the optimality of domain randomization in three different settings. Our results indicate that the sim-to-real gap of the policy trained in the simulation can be  $o(H)$  when the randomized simulator class is finite or satisfies certain smoothness condition, where  $H$  is the horizon of the real-world interaction. We also provide a lower bound showing that such benign conditions are necessary for efficient learning. Our theory highlights the importance of using memory (i.e., history-dependent policies) in domain randomization.  
- To analyze the optimality of domain randomization, we propose a novel proof framework which reduces the problem of bounding the sim-to-real gap of domain randomization to the problem of designing efficient learning algorithms for infinite-horizon MDPs, which we believe are of independent interest.  
- As a byproduct of our proof, we provide the first provably efficient model-based algorithm for learning infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs with general function approximation (Algorithm 4 in Appendix C.3). Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of  $\tilde{O}(D\sqrt{d_e T})$  where  $T$  is the total timesteps and  $d_e$  is a complexity measure of a certain function class  $\mathcal{F}$  that depends on the eluder dimension (Russo & Van Roy, 2013; Osband & Van Roy, 2014).

# 2 RELATED WORK

Sim-to-Real and Domain Randomization The basic idea of sim-to-real is to first train an RL agent in simulation, and then transfer it to the real environment. This idea has been widely applied to problems such as robotics (e.g., Ng et al., 2006; Bousmalis et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2018) and autonomous driving (e.g., Pouyanfar et al., 2019; Niu et al., 2021). To alleviate the influence of reality gap, previous works have proposed different methods to help with sim-to-real transfer, including progressive networks (Rusu et al., 2017), inverse dynamics models (Christiano et al., 2016) and Bayesian methods (Cutler & How, 2015; Pautrat et al., 2018). Domain randomization is an alternative approach to making the learned policy to be more adaptive to different environments (Sadeghi & Levine, 2016; Tobin et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2018), thus greatly reducing the number of real-world interactions.

There are also theoretical works related to sim-to-real transfer. Jiang (2018) uses the number of different state-action pairs as a measure of the gap between the simulator and the real environment. Under the assumption that the number of different pairs is constant, they prove the hardness of sim-to-real transfer and propose efficient adaptation algorithms with further conditions. Feng et al. (2019) prove that an approximate simulator model can effectively reduce the sample complexity in the real environment by eliminating sub-optimal actions from the policy search space. Zhong et al. (2019) formulate a theoretical sim-to-real framework using the rich observation Markov decision processes (ROMDPs), and show that the transfer can result in a smaller real-world sample complexity. None of these results study benefits of domain randomization in sim-to-real transfer. Furthermore, all above works require real-world samples to fine-tune their policy during training, while our work and the domain randomization algorithm do not.

POMDPs and Latent MDPs Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a general framework for sequential decision-making problems when the state is not fully observable (Smallwood & Sondik, 1973; Kaelbling et al., 1998; Vlassis et al., 2012; Jin et al., 2020a; Xiong et al., 2021). Latent MDPs (Kwon et al., 2021), or LMDPs, are a special type of POMDPs, in which the real environment is randomly sampled from a set of MDPs at the beginning of each

episode. This model has been widely investigated with different names such as hidden-model MDPs and multi-model MDPs. There are also results studying the planning problem in LMDPs, when the true parameters of the model is given (Chades et al., 2012; Buchholz & Scheftelowitsch, 2019; Steimle et al., 2021). Kwon et al. (2021) consider the regret minimization problem for LMDPs, and provide efficient learning algorithms under different conditions. We remark that all works mentioned above focus on the problems of finding the optimal policies for POMDPs or latent MDPs, which is perpendicular to the central problem of this paper— bounding the performance gap of transferring the optimal policies of latent MDPs from simulation to the real environment.

Infinite-horizon Average-Reward MDPs Recent theoretical progress has produced many provably sample-efficient algorithms for RL in infinite-horizon average-reward setting. Nearly matching upper bounds and lower bounds are known for the tabular setting (Jaksch et al., 2010; Fruit et al., 2018; Zhang & Ji, 2019; Wei et al., 2020). Beyond the tabular case, Wei et al. (2021) propose efficient algorithms for infinite-horizon MDPs with linear function approximation. To the best of our knowledge, our result (Algorithm 4) is the first efficient algorithm with near-optimal regret for infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs with general function approximation.

# 3 PRELIMINARIES

# 3.1 EPISODIC MDPS

We consider episodic RL problems where each MDP is specified by  $\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},P,R,H,s_1)$ .  $\mathcal{S}$  and  $\mathcal{A}$  are the state and the action space with cardinality  $S$  and  $A$  respectively. We assume that  $S$  and  $A$  are finite but can be extremely large.  $P:\mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{A}\to \Delta (\mathcal{S})$  is the transition probability matrix so that  $P(\cdot |s,a)$  gives the distribution over states if action  $a$  is taken on state  $s$ ,  $R:\mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{A}\rightarrow [0,1]$  is the reward function.  $H$  is the number of steps in one episode.

For simplicity, we assume the agent always starts from the same state in each episode, and use  $s_1$  to denote the initial state at step  $h = 1$ . It is straightforward to extend our results to the case with random initialization. At step  $h \in [H]$ , the agent observes the current state  $s_h \in S$ , takes action  $a_h \in \mathcal{A}$ , receives reward  $R(s_h, a_h)$ , and transits to state  $s_{h+1}$  with probability  $P(s_{h+1}|s_h, a_h)$ . The episode ends when  $s_{H+1}$  is reached.

We consider the history-dependent policy class  $\Pi$ , where  $\pi \in \Pi$  is a collection of mappings from the history observations to the distributions over actions. Specifically, we use  $traj_{h} = \{(s_{1},a_{1},s_{2},a_{2},\dots ,s_{h})\mid s_{i}\in \mathcal{S},a_{i}\in \mathcal{A},i\in [h]\}$  to denote the set of all possible trajectories of history till step  $h$ . We define a policy  $\pi \in \Pi$  to be a collection of  $H$  policy functions  $\{\pi_h:traj_h\to \Delta (\mathcal{A})\}_{h\in [H]}$ . We define  $V_{\mathcal{M},h}^{\pi}:S\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$  to be the value function at step  $h$  under policy  $\pi$  on MDP  $\mathcal{M}$ , i.e.,  $V_{\mathcal{M},h}^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{M},\pi}[\sum_{t = h}^{H}R(s_{t},a_{t})\mid s_{h} = s]$ . Accordingly, we define  $Q_{\mathcal{M},h}^{\pi}:S\times \mathcal{A}\to R$  to be the Q-value function at step  $h$ :  $Q_{\mathcal{M},h}^{\pi}(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{M},\pi}[R(s_{h},a_{h}) + \sum_{t = h + 1}^{H}R(s_{t},a_{t})\mid s_{h} = s,a_{h} = a]$ .

We use  $\pi_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}$  to denote the optimal policy for a single MDP  $\mathcal{M}$ . It can be shown that there exists  $\pi_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}$  such that the policy at step  $h$  depends on only the state at step  $h$  but not any other prior history. That is,  $\pi_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}$  can be expressed as a collection of  $H$  policy functions mapping from  $\mathcal{S}$  to  $\Delta(\mathcal{A})$ . We use  $V_{\mathcal{M},h}^{*}$  and  $Q_{\mathcal{M},h}^{*}$  to denote the optimal value and Q-functions under the optimal policy  $\pi_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}$  at step  $h$ . For notation convenience, we use  $PV(s,a)$  as a shorthand of  $\sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}} P(s'|s,a)V(s')$ .

# 3.2 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF DOMAIN RANDOMIZATION

In this subsection, we briefly introduce how domain randomization works in practical applications. Domain randomization is a popular technique for improving domain transfer (Tobin et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2018; Matas et al., 2018), which is often used for zero-shot transfer when the target domain is unknown or cannot be easily used for training. For example, by highly randomizing the rendering settings for their simulated training set, Sadeghi & Levine (2016) trained vision-based controllers for a quadrotor using only synthetically rendered scenes. OpenAI et al. (2018) studied the problem of dexterous in-hand manipulation. The training is performed entirely in a simulated

environment in which they randomize the physical parameters of the system like friction coefficients and vision properties such as object's appearance.

To apply domain randomization in the simulation training, the first step before domain randomization is usually to build a simulator that is close to the real environment. The simulated model is further improved to match the physical system more closely through calibration. Though the simulation is still a rough approximation of the physical setup after these engineering efforts, these steps ensure that the randomized simulators generated by domain randomization can cover the real-world variability. During the training phase, many aspects of the simulated environment are randomized in each episode in order to help the agent learn a policy that generalizes to reality. The policy trained with domain randomization can be represented using recurrent neural network with memory such as LSTM (Yu et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2018; Doersch & Zisserman, 2019). Such a memory-augmented structure allows the policy to potentially identify the properties of the current environment and adapt its behavior accordingly. With sufficient data sampled using the simulator, the agent can find a near-optimal policy w.r.t. the average value function over a variety of simulation environments. This policy has shown its great adaptivity in many previous results, and can be directly applied to the physical world without any real-world fine-tuning (Sadeghi & Levine, 2016; Matas et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2018).

# 4 FORMULATION

In this section, we propose our theoretical formulation of sim-to-real and domain randomization. The corresponding models will be used to analyze the optimality of domain randomization in the next section, which can also serve as a starting point for future research on sim-to-real.

# 4.1 SIM-TO-REAL TRANSFER

In this paper, we model the simulator as a set of MDPs with tunable latent parameters. We consider an MDP set  $\mathcal{U}$  representing the simulator model with joint state space  $S$  and joint action space  $\mathcal{A}$ . Each MDP  $\mathcal{M} = (S, \mathcal{A}, P_{\mathcal{M}}, R, H, s_1)$  in  $\mathcal{U}$  has its own transition dynamics  $P_{\mathcal{M}}$ , which corresponds to an MDP with certain choice of latent parameters. Our result can be easily extended to the case where the rewards are also influenced by the latent parameters. We assume that there exists an MDP  $\mathcal{M}^* \in \mathcal{U}$  that represents the dynamics of the real environment.

We can now explain our general framework of sim-to-real. For simplicity, we assume that during the simulation phase (or training phase), we are given the entire set  $\mathcal{U}$  that represents MDPs under different tunable latent parameter. Or equivalently, the learning agent is allowed to interact with any MDP  $\mathcal{M} \in \mathcal{U}$  in arbitrary fashion, and sample arbitrary amount of trajectories. However, we do not know which MDP  $\mathcal{M} \in \mathcal{U}$  represents the real environment. The objective of sim-to-real transfer is to find a policy  $\pi$  purely based on  $\mathcal{U}$ , which performs well in the real environment. In particular, we measure the performance in terms of the sim-to-real gap, which is defined as the difference between the value of learned policy  $\pi$  and the value of an optimal policy for the real world:

$$
\operatorname {G a p} (\pi , \mathcal {U}) = V _ {\mathcal {M} ^ {*}, 1} ^ {*} (s _ {1}) - V _ {\mathcal {M} ^ {*}, 1} ^ {\pi} (s _ {1}). \tag {1}
$$

We remark that in our framework, the policy  $\pi$  is learned exclusively in simulation without the use of any real world samples. We study this framework because (1) our primary interests—domain randomization algorithm does not use any real-world samples for training; (2) we would like to focus on the problem of knowledge transfer from simulation to the real world. The more general learning paradigm that allows the fine-tuning of policy learned in simulation using real-world samples can be viewed as a combination of sim-to-real transfer and standard on-policy reinforcement learning, which we left as an interesting topic for future research.

# 4.2 DOMAIN RANDOMIZATION AND LMDPS

We first introduce Latent Markov decision processes (LMDPs) and then explain domain randomization in the viewpoint of LMDPs. A LMDP can be represented as  $(\mathcal{U},\nu)$ , where  $\mathcal{U}$  is a set of MDPs with joint state space  $\mathcal{S}$  and joint action space  $\mathcal{A}$ , and  $\nu$  is a distribution over  $\mathcal{U}$ . Each MDP  $\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},P_{\mathcal{M}},R,H,s_1)$  in  $\mathcal{U}$  has its own transition dynamics  $P_{\mathcal{M}}$  that may differ from other

MDPs. At the start of an episode, an MDP  $\mathcal{M} \in \mathcal{U}$  is randomly chosen according to the distribution  $\nu$ . The agent does not know explicitly which MDP is sampled, but she is allowed to interact with this MDP  $\mathcal{M}$  for one entire episode.

Domain randomization algorithm first specifies a distribution over tunable parameters, which equivalently gives a distribution  $\nu$  over MDPs in simulator  $\mathcal{U}$ . This induces a LMDP with distribution  $\nu$ . The algorithm then samples trajectories from this LMDP, runs RL algorithms in order to find the near-optimal policy of this LMDP. We consider the ideal scenario that the domain randomization algorithm eventually finds the globally optimal policy of this LMDP, which we formulate as domain randomization oracle as follows:

Definition 1. (Domain Randomization Oracle) Let  $\mathcal{U}$  be the set of MDPs generated by domain randomization and  $\nu$  be the uniform distribution over  $\mathcal{U}$ . The domain randomization oracle returns an optimal history-dependent policy  $\pi_{DR}^{*}$  of the LMDP  $(\mathcal{U},\nu)$ :

$$
\pi_ {D R} ^ {*} = \underset {\pi \in \Pi} {\arg \max } \mathbb {E} _ {\mathcal {M} \sim \nu} V _ {\mathcal {M}, 1} ^ {\pi} \left(s _ {1}\right). \tag {2}
$$

Since LMDP is a special case of POMDPs, its optimal policy  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  in general will depend on history. This is in sharp contrast with the optimal policy of a MDP, which is history-independent. We emphasize that both the memory-augmented policy and the randomization of the simulated environment are critical to the optimality guarantee of domain randomization. We also note that we don't restrict the learning algorithm used to find the policy  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$ , which can be either in a model-based or model-free style. Also, we don't explicitly define the behavior of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$ . The only thing we know about  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  is that it satisfies the optimality condition defined in Equation 2. In this paper, we aim to bound the sim-to-real gap of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$ , i.e.,  $\operatorname{Gap}(\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}, \mathcal{U})$  under different regimes.

# 5 MAIN RESULTS

We are ready to present the sim-to-real gap of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  in this section. We study the gap in three different settings under our sim-to-real framework: finite simulator class (the cardinality  $|\mathcal{U}|$  is finite) with the separation condition (MDPs in  $\mathcal{U}$  are distinct), finite simulator class without the separation condition, and infinite simulator class. During our analysis, we mainly study the long-horizon setting where  $H$  is relatively large compared with other parameters. This is a challenging setting that has been widely-studied in recent years (Gupta et al., 2019; Mandlekar et al., 2020; Pirk et al., 2020). We show that the sim-to-real gap of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  is only  $O(\log^3(H))$  for the finite simulator class with the separation condition, and only  $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{H})$  in the last two settings, matching the best possible lower bound in terms of  $H$ .

In our analysis, we assume that the MDPs in  $\mathcal{U}$  are communicating MDPs with a bounded diameter.

Assumption 1 (Communicating MDPs (Jaksch et al., 2010)). The diameter of any  $MDP\mathcal{M}\in \mathcal{U}$  is bounded by  $D$ . That is, consider the stochastic process defined by a stationary policy  $\pi :S\to \mathcal{A}$  on an MDP with initial state  $s$ . Let  $T(s^{\prime}|\mathcal{M},\pi ,s)$  denote the random variable for the first time step in which state  $s^\prime$  is reached in this process, then

$$
\max_{s\neq s^{\prime}\in \mathcal{S}}\min_{\pi :\mathcal{S}\to \mathcal{A}}\mathbb{E}\left[T\left(s^{\prime}\mid \mathcal{M},\pi ,s\right)\right]\leq D.
$$

This is a natural assumption widely used in the literature (Jaksch et al., 2010; Agrawal & Jia, 2017; Fruit et al., 2020). The communicating MDP model also covers many real-world tasks in robotics. For example, transferring the position or angle of a mechanical arm only costs constant time. Moreover, the diameter assumption is necessary under our framework.

Proposition 1. Without Assumption 1, there exists a hard instance  $\mathcal{U}$  so that  $\mathrm{Gap}(\pi_{DR}^{*},\mathcal{U}) = \Omega (H)$ .

We prove Proposition 1 in Appendix G.1. Note that the worst possible gap of any policy is  $H$ , so  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^*$  becomes ineffective without Assumption 1.

# 5.1 FINITE SIMULATOR CLASS WITH SEPARATION CONDITION

As a starting point, we will show the sim-to-real gap when the MDP set  $\mathcal{U}$  is a finite set with cardinality  $M$ . Intuitively, a desired property of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^*$  is the ability to identify the environment the agent is

exploring within a few steps. This is because  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  is trained under uniform random environments, so we hope it can learn to tell the differences between environments. As long as  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  has this property, the agent is able to identify the environment dynamics quickly, and behave optimally afterwards (note that the MDP set  $\mathcal{U}$  is known to the agent).

Before presenting the general results, we first examine a simpler case where all MDPs in  $\mathcal{U}$  are distinct. Concretely, we assume that any two MDPs in  $\mathcal{U}$  are well-separated on at least one state-action pair. Note that this assumption is much weaker than the separation condition in Kwon et al. (2021), which assumes strongly separated condition for each state-action pair.

Assumption 2 ( $\delta$ -separated MDP set). For any  $\mathcal{M}_1, \mathcal{M}_2 \in \mathcal{U}$ , there exists a state-action pair  $(s, a) \in S \times \mathcal{A}$ , such that the  $L_1$  distance between the probability of next state of the different MDPs is at least  $\delta$ , i.e.

$$
\left\| \left(P _ {\mathcal {M} _ {1}} - P _ {\mathcal {M} _ {2}}\right) (\cdot | s, a) \right\| _ {1} \geq \delta . \tag {3}
$$

The following theorem shows the sim-to-real gap of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  in  $\delta$ -separated MDP sets.

Theorem 1. Under Assumption 1 and Assumption 2, for any  $\mathcal{M} \in \mathcal{U}$ , the sim-to-real gap of  $\pi_{DR}^{*}$  is at most

$$
\operatorname {G a p} \left(\pi_ {D R} ^ {*}, \mathcal {U}\right) = O \left(\frac {D M ^ {3} \log (M H) \log^ {2} (S M H)}{\delta^ {4}}\right). \tag {4}
$$

The proof of Theorem 1 is deferred to Appendix D. Though the dependence on  $M$  and  $\delta$  may not be tight, our bound has only poly-logarithmic dependence on the horizon  $H$ .

The main difficulty to prove Theorem 1 is that we do not know what  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  does exactly despite knowing a simple and clean strategy in the real-world interaction with minimum sim-to-real gap. That is, to firstly visit the state-action pairs that help the agent identify the environment quickly and then follow the optimal policy in the real MDP  $\mathcal{M}^*$  after identifying  $\mathcal{M}^*$ . Therefore, we use a novel constructive argument in the proof. We construct a base policy that implements the idea mentioned above, and show that  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  cannot be much worse than the base policy. The proof overview can be found in Section 6.

# 5.2 FINITE SIMULATOR CLASS WITHOUT SEPARATION CONDITION

Now we generalize the setting and study the sim-to-real gap of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  when  $\mathcal{U}$  is finite but not necessary a  $\delta$ -separated MDP set. Surprisingly, we show that  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  can achieve  $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{H})$  sim-to-real gap when  $|\mathcal{U}| = M$ .

Theorem 2. Under Assumption 1, when the MDP set induced by domain randomization  $\mathcal{U}$  is a finite set with cardinality  $M$ , the sim-to-real gap of  $\pi_{DR}^{*}$  is upper bounded by

$$
\operatorname {G a p} \left(\pi_ {D R} ^ {*}, \mathcal {U}\right) = O \left(D \sqrt {M ^ {3} H \log (M H)}\right). \tag {5}
$$

Theorem 2 is proved in Appendix E. This theorem implies the importance of randomization and memory in the domain randomization algorithms (Sadeghi & Levine, 2016; Tobin et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2018; OpenAI et al., 2018). With both of them, we successfully reduce the worst possible gap of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^*$  from the order of  $H$  to the order of  $\sqrt{H}$ , so per step loss will be only  $\tilde{O}(H^{-1/2})$ . Without randomization, it is not possible to reduce the worst possible gap (i.e., the sim-to-real gap) because the policy is even not trained on all environments. Without memory, the policy is not able to implicitly "identify" the environments, so it cannot achieve sublinear loss in the worst case.

We also use a constructive argument to prove Theorem 2. However, it is more difficult to construct the base policy because we do not have any idea to minimize the gap without the well-separated condition (Assumption 2). Fortunately, we observe that the base policy is also a memory-based policy, which basically can be viewed as an algorithm that seeks to minimize the sim-to-real gap in an unknown underlying MDP in  $\mathcal{U}$ . Therefore, we connect the sim-to-real gap of the base policy with the regret bound of the algorithms in infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs (Bartlett & Tewari, 2012; Fruit et al., 2018; Zhang & Ji, 2019). The proof overview is deferred to Section 6.

To illustrate the hardness of minimizing the worst case gap, we prove the following lower bound for  $\mathrm{Gap}(\pi ,\mathcal{U})$  to show that any policy must suffer a gap at least  $\Omega (\sqrt{H})$

Theorem 3. Under Assumption 1, suppose  $A \geq 10$ ,  $SA \geq M \geq 100$ ,  $d \geq 20\log_A M$ ,  $H \geq DM$ , for any history dependent policy  $\pi = \{\pi_h : \text{traj}_h \to \mathcal{A}\}_{h=1}^H$ , there exists a set of  $M$  MDPs  $\mathcal{U} = \{\mathcal{M}_m\}_{m=1}^M$  and a choice of  $\mathcal{M}^* \in \mathcal{U}$  such that  $\operatorname{Gap}(\pi, \mathcal{U})$  is at least  $\Omega(\sqrt{DMH})$ .

The proof of Theorem 3 follows the idea of the lower bound proof for tabular MDPs (Jaksch et al., 2010), which we defer to Appendix G.2. This lower bound implies that  $\Omega(\sqrt{H})$  sim-to-real gap is unavoidable for the policy  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  when directly transferred to the real environment.

# 5.3 INFINITE SIMULATOR CLASS

In real-world scenarios, the MDP class is very likely to be extensively large. For instance, many physical parameters such as surface friction coefficients and robot joint damping coefficients are sampled uniformly from a continuous interval in the Dexterous Hand Manipulation algorithms (OpenAI et al., 2018). In these cases, the induced MDP set  $\mathcal{U}$  is large and even infinite. A natural question is whether we can extend our analysis to the infinite simulator class case, and provide a corresponding sim-to-real gap.

Intuitively, since the domain randomization approach returns the optimal policy in the average manner, the policy  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  can perform bad in the real world  $\mathcal{M}^*$  if most MDPs in the randomized set differ much with  $\mathcal{M}^*$ . In other words,  $\mathcal{U}$  must be "smooth" near  $\mathcal{M}^*$  for domain randomization to return a nontrivial policy. By "smoothness", we mean that there is a positive probability that the uniform distribution  $\nu$  returns a MDP that is close to  $\mathcal{M}^*$ . This is because the probability that  $\nu$  samples exactly  $\mathcal{M}^*$  in an infinite simulator class is 0, so domain randomization cannot work at all if such smoothness does not hold.

Formally, we assume there is a distance measure  $d(\mathcal{M}_1,\mathcal{M}_2)$  on  $\mathcal{U}$  between two MDPs  $\mathcal{M}_1$  and  $\mathcal{M}_2$ . Define the  $\epsilon$ -neighborhood  $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}^{*},\epsilon}$  of  $\mathcal{M}^*$  as  $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}^{*},\epsilon} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \{\mathcal{M} \in \mathcal{U} : d(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{M}^{*}) \leq \epsilon\}$ . The smoothness condition is formally stated as follows:

Assumption 3 (Smoothness near  $\mathcal{M}^*$ ). There exists a positive real number  $\epsilon_0$ , and a Lipschitz constant  $L$ , such that for the policy  $\pi_{DR}^{*}$ , the value function of any two MDPs in  $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}^*,\epsilon_0}$  is  $L$ -Lipschitz w.r.t the distance function  $d$ , i.e.

$$
\left| V _ {\mathcal {M} _ {1}, 1} ^ {\pi_ {D R} ^ {*}} \left(s _ {1}\right) - V _ {\mathcal {M} _ {2}, 1} ^ {\pi_ {D R} ^ {*}} \left(s _ {1}\right) \right| \leq L \cdot d \left(\mathcal {M} _ {1}, \mathcal {M} _ {2}\right), \forall \mathcal {M} _ {1}, \mathcal {M} _ {2} \in \mathcal {C} _ {\mathcal {M} ^ {*}, \epsilon_ {0}}. \tag {6}
$$

For example, we can set  $d(\mathcal{M}_1, \mathcal{M}_2) = \mathbb{I}[\mathcal{M}_1 \neq \mathcal{M}_2]$  in the finite simulator class. For complicated simulator class, we need to ensure there exists some  $d(\cdot, \cdot)$  that  $L$  is not large.

With Assumption 3, it is possible to compute the sim-to-real gap of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$ . In the finite simulator class, we have shown that the gap depends on  $M$  polynomially, which can be viewed as the complexity of  $\mathcal{U}$ . The question is, how do we measure the complexity of  $\mathcal{U}$  when it is infinitely large?

Motivated by Ayoub et al. (2020), we consider the function class

$$
\mathcal {F} = \left\{f _ {\mathcal {M}} (s, a, \lambda): \mathcal {S} \times \mathcal {A} \times \Lambda \rightarrow \mathbb {R} \text {s u c h t h a t} f _ {\mathcal {M}} (s, a, \lambda) = P _ {\mathcal {M}} \lambda (s, a) \text {f o r} \mathcal {M} \in \mathcal {U}, \lambda \in \Lambda \right\}, \tag {7}
$$

where  $\Lambda = \{\lambda_{\mathcal{M}}^{*},\mathcal{M}\in \mathcal{U}\}$  is the optimal bias functions of  $\mathcal{M}\in \mathcal{U}$  in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting (Bartlett & Tewari (2012); Fruit et al. (2018); Zhang & Ji (2019)). We note this function class is only used for analysis purposes to express our complexity measure; it does not affect the domain randomization algorithm. We use the  $\epsilon$ -log-covering number and the  $\epsilon$ -eluder dimension of  $\mathcal{F}$  to characterize the complexity of the simulator class  $\mathcal{U}$ . In the setting of linear combined models (Ayoub et al., 2020), the  $\epsilon$ -log-covering number and the  $\epsilon$ -eluder dimension are  $O(d\log(1/\epsilon))$ , where  $d$  is the dimension of the linear representation in linear combined models. For readers not familiar with eluder dimension or infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs, please see Appendix A for preliminary explanations.

Here comes our bound of sim-to-real gap for the infinite simulator class setting, which is proved in Appendix F.

Theorem 4. Under Assumption 1 and 3, the sim-to-real gap of the domain randomization policy  $\pi_{DR}^{*}$  is at most for  $0\leq \epsilon < \epsilon_0$

$$
\operatorname {G a p} \left(\pi_ {D R} ^ {*}, \mathcal {U}\right) = O \left(\frac {D \sqrt {d _ {e} H \log (H \cdot \mathcal {N} (\mathcal {F} , 1 / H))}}{\nu \left(\mathcal {C} _ {\mathcal {M} ^ {*} , \epsilon}\right)} + L \epsilon\right). \tag {8}
$$

Here  $\nu (\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}^{*},\epsilon})$  is the probability of  $\nu$  sampling a MDP in  $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}^{*},\epsilon}$ ,  $d_{e} = \dim_{E}(\mathcal{F},1 / H)$  is the  $1 / H$ -eluder dimension  $\mathcal{F}$ , and  $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{F},1 / H)$  is the  $1 / H$ -covering number of  $\mathcal{F}$  w.r.t.  $L_{\infty}$  norm.

Theorem 4 is a generalization of Theorem 2, since we can reduce Theorem 4 to Theorem 2 by setting  $d(\mathcal{M}_1,\mathcal{M}_2) = \mathbb{I}[\mathcal{M}_1\neq \mathcal{M}_2]$  and  $\epsilon = 0$ , in which case  $\nu (\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}^{*},\epsilon}) = 1 / M$  and  $d_{e}\leq M$ .

The proof overview can be found in Section 6. The main technique is still a reduction to the regret minimization problem in infinite-horizon average-reward setting. We construct a base policy and shows that the regret of it is only  $\tilde{O} (\sqrt{H})$ . A key point to note is that our construction of the base policy also solves an open problem of designing efficient algorithms that achieve  $\tilde{O} (\sqrt{T})$  regret in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting with general function approximation. This base policy is of independent interests.

To complement our positive results, we also provide a negative result that even if the MDPs in  $\mathcal{U}$  have nice low-rank properties (e.g., the linear low-rank property (Jin et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2020)), the policy  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^*$  returned by the domain randomization oracle can still have  $\Omega(H)$  sim-to-real gap when the simulator class is large and the smoothness condition (Assumption 3) does not hold. This explains the necessity of our preconditions. Please refer to Proposition 2 in Appendix G.3 for details.

# 6 PROOF OVERVIEW

In this section, we will give a short overview of our novel proof techniques for the results shown in section 5. The main proof technique is based on reducing the problem of bounding the sim-to-real gap to the problem of constructing base policies. In the settings without separation conditions, we further connect the construction of the base policies to the design of efficient learning algorithms for the infinite-horizon average-reward settings.

# 6.1 REDUCING TO CONSTRUCTING BASE POLICIES

Intuitively, if there exists a base policy  $\hat{\pi} \in \Pi$  with bounded sim-to-real gap, then the gap of  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  will not be too large since  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  defined in Eqn 2 is the policy with the maximum average value.

Lemma 1. Suppose there exists a policy  $\hat{\pi} \in \Pi$  such that the sim-to-real gap of  $\hat{\pi}$  for any MDP  $\mathcal{M} \in \mathcal{U}$  satisfies  $V_{\mathcal{M},1}^{*}(s_1) - V_{\mathcal{M},1}^{\hat{\pi}}(s_1) \leq C$ , then we have

$$
\operatorname {G a p} \left(\pi_ {D R} ^ {*}, \mathcal {U}\right) \leq M C, \tag {9}
$$

when  $\mathcal{U}$  is a finite set with  $|\mathcal{U}| = M$ . Furthermore, when  $\mathcal{U}$  is an infinite set satisfying the smoothness condition (assumption 3), we have for any  $0 < \epsilon < \epsilon_0$

$$
\operatorname {G a p} \left(\pi_ {D R} ^ {*}, \mathcal {U}\right) \leq C / \nu \left(\mathcal {C} _ {\mathcal {M} ^ {*}, \epsilon}\right) + L \epsilon . \tag {10}
$$

We defer the proof to Appendix B.1. Now with this reduction lemma, the remaining problem is defined as follows: Suppose the real MDP  $\mathcal{M}^*$  belongs to the MDP set  $\mathcal{U}$ . We know the full information (transition matrix) of any MDP in the MDP set  $\mathcal{U}$ . How to design a history-dependent policy  $\hat{\pi} \in \Pi$  with minimum sim-to-real gap  $\max_{\mathcal{M} \in \mathcal{U}} \left( V_{\mathcal{M},1}^*(s_1) - V_{\mathcal{M},1}^{\hat{\pi}}(s_1) \right)$ .

# 6.2 THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BASE POLICIES

With separation conditions With the help of Lemma 1, we can bound the sim-to-real gap in the setting of finite simulator class with separation condition by constructing a history-dependent policy  $\hat{\pi}$ . The formal definition of the policy  $\hat{\pi}$  can be found in Appendix C.1. The idea of the construction is based on elimination: the policy  $\hat{\pi}$  explicitly collects samples on the "informative" state-action

pairs and eliminates the MDP that is less likely to be the real MDP from the candidate set. Once the agent identifies the real MDP representing the dynamics of the physical environment, it follows the optimal policy of the real MDP until the end of the interactions.

Without separation conditions The main challenge in this setting is that, we can no longer construct a policy  $\hat{\pi}$  that "identify" the real MDP using the approaches as in the settings with separation conditions. In fact, we may not be able to even "identify" the real MDP since there can be MDPs in  $\mathcal{U}$  that is very close to real MDP. Here, we use a different approach, which reduces the minimization of sim-to-real gap of  $\hat{\pi}$  to the regret minimization problem in the infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs.

The infinite-horizon average-reward setting has been well-studied (e.g., Jaksch et al., 2010; Agrawal & Jia, 2017; Fruit et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2020). The main difference compared with the episodic setting is that the agent interacts with the environment for infinite steps. The gain of a policy is defined in the average manner. The value of a policy  $\pi$  is defined as  $\rho^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}[\lim_{T\to \infty}\sum_{t = 1}^{T}R(s_t,\pi (s_t)) / T\mid s_1 = s]$ . The optimal gain is defined as  $\rho^{*}(s)\stackrel {\mathrm{def}}{=}\max_{s\in S}\max_{\pi}\rho^{\pi}(s)$ , which is shown to be state-independent in Agrawal & Jia (2017), so we use  $\rho^{*}$  for short. The regret in the infinite-horizon setting is defined as  $\operatorname {Reg}(T) = \mathbb{E}\left[T\rho^{*} - \sum_{t = 1}^{T}R(s_{t},a_{t})\right]$ , where the expectation is over the randomness of the trajectories. A more detailed explanation of infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs can be found in Appendix A.1.

For an MDP  $\mathcal{M} \in \mathcal{U}$ , we can view it as a finite-horizon MDP with horizon  $H$ ; or we can view it as an infinite-horizon MDP. This is because Assumption 1 ensures that the agent can travel to any state from any state  $s_H$  encountered at the  $H$ -th step (this may not be the case in the standard finite-horizon MDPs, since people often assume that the states at the  $H$ -th level are terminating state). The following lemma shows the connection between these two views.

Lemma 2. For a MDP  $\mathcal{M}$ , let  $\rho_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}$  and  $V_{\mathcal{M},1}^{*}(s_{1})$  to be the optimal expected gain in the infinite-horizon view and the optimal value function in the episodic view respectively. We have the following inequality:  $H\rho_{\mathcal{M}}^{*} - D\leq V_{\mathcal{M},1}^{*}(s_{1})\leq H\rho_{\mathcal{M}}^{*} + D$ .

This lemma indicates that, if we can design an algorithm (i.e. the base policy)  $\hat{\pi}$  in the infinite-horizon setting with regret  $\operatorname{Reg}(H)$ , then the sim-to-real gap of this algorithm in episodic setting satisfies  $\operatorname{Gap}(\hat{\pi},\mathcal{U}) = V_{\mathcal{M},1}^{*}(s_1) - V_{\mathcal{M},1}^{\hat{\pi}}(s_1) \leq \operatorname{Reg}(H) + D$ . This lemma connects the sim-to-real gap of  $\hat{\pi}$  in finite-horizon setting to the regret in the infinite-horizon setting.

With the help of Lemma 1 and 2, the remaining problem is to design an efficient exploration algorithm for infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs with the knowledge that the real MDP  $\mathcal{M}^*$  belongs to a known MDP set  $\mathcal{U}$ . Therefore, we propose two optimistic-exploration algorithms (Algorithm 3 and Algorithm 4) for the setting of finite simulator class and infinite simulator class respectively. The formal definition of the algorithms are deferred to Appendix C.2 and Appendix C.3. Note that our Algorithm 4 is the first efficient algorithm with  $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$  regret in the infinite-horizon average-reward MDPs with general function approximation, which is of independent interest for efficient online exploration in reinforcement learning.

# 7 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we study the optimality of policies learned from domain randomization in sim-to-real transfer without real-world samples. We propose a novel formulation of sim-to-real transfer and view domain randomization as an oracle that returns the optimal policy of an LMDP with uniform initialization distribution. Following this idea, we show that the policy  $\pi_{\mathrm{DR}}^{*}$  can suffer only  $o(H)$  loss compared with the optimal value function of the real environment when the simulator class is finite or satisfies certain smoothness condition, thus this policy can perform well in the long-horizon cases. We hope our formulation and analysis can provide insight to design more efficient algorithms for sim-to-real transfer in the future.
