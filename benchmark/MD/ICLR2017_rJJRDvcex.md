# ABSTRACT

In this paper, we propose a Layer-RNN (L-RNN) network that is able to learn contextual information adaptively using within-layer recurrence. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) we propose a hybrid neural network architecture that interleaves traditional convolutional layers with Layer-RNN for modelling long-range dependencies; (ii) we show that a Layer-RNN can be seamlessly inserted into any convolutional layer of a pre-trained CNN, and the entire network then fine-tuned, leading to a boost in performance; and (iii) we report experiments on the CIFAR-10 classification task reaching  $5.7\%$  top1 error; for image segmentation, we start with a pre-trained FCN VGG-16 network, and show that its performance on the PASCAL VOC2012 semantic segmentation task can be boosted by  $5\%$  (mean IOU) by simply inserting Layer-RNNs.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In computer vision tasks, such as image classification or pixel level prediction, multi-scale contextual information plays a very important role in achieving high performance. The original architectures for these tasks (e.g. He et al. (2016a); Krizhevsky et al. (2012); Long et al. (2015); Ronneberger et al. (2015); Simonyan & Zisserman (2015); Szegedy et al. (2015)) were able to obtain multi-scale context with a large spatial footprint by the composition of filters through the layers of the network, so that a large receptive field was effectively built up. Indeed, the final layers of these networks use average pooling or fully connected layers (convolution with a large kernel) so that the effective receptive field covers the entire input image patch. More recent pixel prediction architectures have used dilated convolutions (Chen et al., 2016; Yu & Koltun, 2016) which are able to aggregate multi-scale contextual information without losing resolution (due to the spatial pooling and strides in the original architectures), and without incurring the penalty of having to learn many parameters for convolutions with very large kernels.

In this paper we introduce an alternative 'module' for learning multi-scale spatial contextual information by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within layers. This approach is inspired by the ReNet architecture of Visin et al. (2015), which we extend here into a hybrid architecture that interleaves traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) modules with layer recurrent modules, and we term a Layer Recurrent Neural Network (L-RNN). A L-RNN module is a composition of 1D RNNs, and is able to learn contextual information adaptively, with the effective receptive field able to reach across the entire feature map or image, if that is required for the task. The hybrid network combines the best of both worlds: canonical CNNs are composed of filters that are efficient in capturing features in a local region, whilst the L-RNNs are able to learn long-range dependencies across a layer efficiently with only a small number of parameters.

We describe the basic L-RNN module in Section 2, and discuss different choices for the hybrid architecture by incorporating L-RNN into residual blocks (He et al., 2016b) in Section 3. In addition, in Section 4, we explain how L-RNN modules can be inserted into pre-trained CNNs seamlessly. This means that the entire network does not have to be trained from scratch, only the added L-RNNs are fine-tuned together with pre-trained networks, and the experiments show that this addition always improves performance. In Section 5, we experiment on the CIFAR-10 classification with networks of increasing depths, by using Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016), we are able to train vanilla RNNs to match the performance of GRU (Chung et al., 2015), while using fewer parameters. In addition, we fine-tune a truncated VGG-16 FCN base net for semantic segmentation on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset.

It is worth noting that (broadly) recurrence can be used in feed-forward multi-layer convolutional neural network architectures in two ways: between layers, and within layers. For example, between-layer recurrence was used for scene labelling in (Liang et al., 2015; Pinheiro & Collobert, 2014) with convolutions applied recursively on top of concatenations of feature maps from different layers or raw input images. And in (Zheng et al., 2015), spatial dependencies are modelled explicitly for semantic segmentation with densely connected Gaussian CRFs by iterated application of bilateral filtering using between-layer recurrence.

By contrast, our Layer-RNN architecture falls into the second category, where within-layer recurrence is used to capture dependencies. Others have learnt contextual information from within layer recurrence for tasks such as object detection (Bell et al., 2016), and low-level vision problems, such as de-noising, colourization and smoothing (Liu et al., 2016). We postpone discussing in detail the relationships of the proposed Layer-RNN modules to these architectures, and to that of ReNet (Visin et al., 2015) and ReSeg (Visin et al., 2016), until we have introduced the L-RNN in Section 2.

# 2 LAYER-RNN ARCHITECTURE

The architecture of the network (Figure 1) is composed of two parts. Local features are first calculated by the low-level CNNs module. Then, the Layer-RNN (L-RNN) module, consisting of several 1D spatial RNNs is applied to capture the spatial dependencies. By scanning across the feature maps in different directions, the complete L-RNN is able to learn the receptive field in an adaptive way, up to the size of the entire image.

Figure 1: Basic Architecture:

Given the input image, local features are calculated by the CNN module (A).

In (B), two 1D spatial RNNs are applied to scan along each row independently from different directions, hidden states are calculated at every spatial step, and the output feature maps can either be concatenated or summed up. The receptive field for the black pixel in (B) is labelled in orange;

In (C), two 1D spatial RNNs are applied to scan along each column from two directions, the receptive field for the black pixel in (C) is able to cover the whole image of input.

The combination of (B) and (C) can define the L-RNN to approximate 2D kernels.

# 2.1 LAYER-RNN MODULE

As shown in Figure 1, the Layer-RNN (L-RNN) module is a combination of the 1D spatial recurrent modules (B) and (C). In each module, there are two 1D RNNs scanning across the feature maps horizontally or vertically from two directions, and their hidden states are updated at every spatial step. Consequently, for each of the horizontal and vertical directions, two output feature maps are obtained with the same width and height as the input feature maps. In our implementation, we simply sum up these output feature maps (an alternative is to concatenate the output feature map, but that would increase the number of parameters).

More formally, assume the feature maps (layer  $L$ ) coming into the L-RNN module are  $X^L \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n \times d}$  and output  $X^{L+1}$  (layer  $L+1$ ), where  $m, n, d$  refers to the width, height, and the number of feature maps respectively for the input layer. For simplicity, assume the input to the 1D spatial RNNs from  $X^L$  is a feature vector at each spatial location, each row or column on the feature maps is treated as one sequence. When scanning from left to right, the feature responses for location  $ij$  can be calculated as:

$$
x _ {i, j} ^ {L + 1} = f \left(U x _ {i, j} ^ {L} + V x _ {i, j - 1} ^ {L + 1} + b\right) \quad \text {l e f t}
$$

Where  $x_{i,0}^{L + 1} = 0$ ,  $x_{i,j}^{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times 1}$ ,  $x_{i,j}^{L + 1}, x_{i,j - 1}^{L + 1} \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times 1}$ ,  $U \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times d}$ ,  $V \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}$ ,  $b \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times 1}$ ,  $D$  denotes the number of nodes used in the 1D spatial RNN, and  $f$  refers to the non-linearity function. 1D spatial RNNs scanning other directions can be calculated similarly. Notice that, the first term of equation 1 encodes local information independently, resembling the normal convolutional layer, and the second term characterizes the within-layer recurrence. We make use of this observation in Section 4.

# 2.2 DISCUSSION AND RELATION TO OTHER WORK

As can be seen in figure 1B and 1C, the effective receptive field can cover the entire image. However, the actual receptive field depends on the parameters of the RNN, and can be learnt adaptively. As an insight to what is learnt, consider a separable filter, such as an axis aligned 2D Gaussian. Such filters can be applied exactly by a composition of 1D Gaussian convolutions in the horizontal and vertical directions. The 1D spatial RNN can approximate finite 1D convolutions of this type.

We next discuss the relation of the L-RNN to prior work. First, ReNets (Visin et al., 2015), which is an architecture completely made of 1D RNNs (i.e. no CNNs). In ReNet, the input images are first split into non-overlapping patches of size  $m \times n \times d$ , where  $m, n, d$  refer to width, height and feature channels respectively. The 1D RNNs take the flattened patch  $(mn \times d)$  as input, and outputs feature vector of size  $D \times 1$ , where  $D$  refers to the number of nodes used in the RNNs. In contrast, we apply 1D RNNs to the outputs of a CNN. There are two benefits of this: first, the CNN is able to extract local features, and the L-RNN stacked upon them is able to learn dependencies between local features (rather than the input channel reformatted); second, we are able to introduce more non-linearities (through the convolutional and pooling layers), and a RNN can't do this.

The 2D-RNN, proposed in (Graves & Schmidhuber, 2009; Theis & Bethge, 2015), is able to scan across the image or feature maps row-by-row, or column-by-column sequentially, with each RNN node accept input from three sources, namely, projections of current input, and feedbacks from the two neighbour nodes. By contrast, we use unidirectional 1D spatial RNNs, with each hidden node only accepting feedbacks from its previous node. Another advantage of our model is that rows or columns can be processed in parallel on GPUs, and training time is shortened.

Bell et al. (2016) uses layer RNNs for contextual information in object detection, and Visin et al. (2016) uses layer RNNs for semantic segmentation in the ReSeg architecture. There is a technical difference with Bell et al. (2016) in that they train 8 1D spatial RNNs, and we simplify this process by training only 4 1D spatial RNNs stacked in a cascade. However, the more substantial differences are two fold: first, we treat the L-RNN module as a general block, that can be inserted into any layer of a modern architecture, such as into a residual module. Second, we show (section 4) that the L-RNN can be formulated to be inserted into a pre-trained FCN (by initializing with zero recurrence matrices), and that the entire network can then be fine-tuned end-to-end.

Liu et al. (2016) proposes a spatially variant linear RNN by introducing a weight map (edge map). The weight map is trained to predict object boundaries with low-level CNNs, and can further be used to constrain the information propagation in RNNs. In these architectures, the weight map can be seen as the gates in GRU or LSTM. In contrast, we use 1D spatial RNNs with ReLU activation and do not explicitly learn the weight map.

# 3 CNNS & LAYER-RNN MODULES

In this section, we consider three alternative architectures for incorporating 1D spatial RNNs or a L-RNN module into the computational block, such as a residual block of a Residual Networks (He et al., 2016b). We start with the standard residual block of (He et al., 2016b) (figure 2(a)), and then replace the included CNN layer with a L-RNN module (figure 2(b)). Of course, as with the Residual Network architecture, a variable number of these blocks can be included and interleaved with standard (convolutional only) blocks.

In addition, in the experimental evaluation of Section 5.1, we compare three options for fusing features from such blocks as the input for subsequent layers, namely forward, sum and concatenation: forward refers to the traditional feed-forward architectures:

$$
X ^ {L + 1} = F \left(X ^ {L}, W\right) \tag {2}
$$

(a) CNN Module

(b) LRNN Module  
Figure 2: Basic Modules for Classification: In each module, Batch Normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy (2015)) is used after the convolution, and ReLU as non-linear function.

Forward, Sum or Concatenation can be used for skip layers.

The L-RNN Module to approximate 2D kernels with flexible size.

i.e. the block simply becomes a new layer; sum denotes the method of the original residual networks:

$$
X ^ {L + 1} = X ^ {L} + F \left(X ^ {L}, W\right) \tag {3}
$$

so that the L-RNN module acts as a residual block; whilst, in concatenation, features from multiple layers (same spatial sizes) are concatenated:

$$
X ^ {L + 1} = \left[ X ^ {L}; F \left(X ^ {L}, W\right) \right] \quad ;) \text {r e f i r s t o c o n c a t e n a t i o n} \tag {4}
$$

Therefore, the channels of output feature maps will be the sum of the channels of the two concatenated layers (the number of parameters will be increased for the next layers).

# 4 ADDING A LAYER-RNN TO A PRE-TRAINED CNN

In this section, we describe how a Layer RNN module, can be seamlessly inserted into a pre-trained CNNs. In a typical scenario the CNN would be trained for classification on ImageNet (where there are copious annotations), after inserting L-RNN, the hybrid L-RNN network can then be fine tuned for a new task such as pixel-level prediction, e.g. semantic segmentation (where the annotated data is usually more limited). This trick naturally allows multi-scale contexts to be effortlessly incorporated. Avoiding training the network from scratch, means the entire network can be re-purposed with the available annotation and trained end-to-end for the new task, whilst benefiting from the earlier classification training.

We illustrate the idea using 1D convolution, but same principles hold for the entire L-RNN module. As shown in Figure 3, the canonical CNN architecture for a 1D convolution can be denoted as:

$$
X ^ {L + 1} = f \left(W * X ^ {L} + b\right) \tag {5}
$$

where  $*$  refers to convolution,  $W$  and  $b$  are the parameters of the CNN,  $L, L + 1$  denote the layer. The 1D spatial RNN can be written as:

$$
X _ {i} ^ {L + 1} = f \left(U * X _ {i} ^ {L} + V X _ {i - 1} ^ {L + 1} + b\right) \tag {6}
$$

where  $U, V, b$  refer to the parameters that are shared across the whole scan-line.

Notice that, the 1D spatial RNN are designed to incorporate two terms, projections from local region (input-to-hidden) and recurrence term from previous hidden unit (hidden-to-hidden). In fact, it is the presence of non-zero recurrence matrix  $V$ , that characterizes the 1D spatial RNN, and they can be calculated in a two-step way as:

$$
X ^ {i n t e r} = U * X ^ {L} \quad (\text {C o n v o l u t i o n}) \tag {7}
$$

$$
X _ {i} ^ {L + 1} = f \left(X _ {i} ^ {\text {i n t e r}} + b\right) (i = 1, \text {z e r o i n i t i a l s t a t e s}) \tag {8}
$$

$$
X _ {i} ^ {L + 1} = f \left(X _ {i} ^ {\text {i n t e r}} + V X _ {i - 1} ^ {L + 1} + b\right) (i > 1) \tag {9}
$$

By interpreting the recurrence in this way, 1D spatial RNNs can be constructed by inserting recurrence directly into any CNNs layer right after the convolution. If the recurrence matrix  $V$  is initialized as zero, and ReLU is the activation function, then the 1D spatial RNN will be initialized exactly as the pre-trained CNNs. The complete L-RNN can be constructed by inserting two 1D spatial RNNs into subsequent layers of the pre-trained CNNs. We derive the expression of the within-layer gradient for use in back-prop fine-tuning in Appendix B.

# 5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

We test the proposed Layer-RNN on two supervised learning tasks: CIFAR-10 classification in Section 5.1; and PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation in Section 5.2.

# 5.1 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

In this section, we investigate classification performance under variations in an architecture containing L-RNN modules. We vary the depth of the network, type of recurrent units in the RNNs, pooling mechanisms for the last pooling layer, and the method of fusing the block outputs.

Architecture. The architectures are shown in Figure 4 (symbols are adapted from Figure 2). The L-RNN module is used to capture global information over the entire image, in a similar manner to the fully connected layers or average pooling in other networks, and is added at the end of the CNN module. For the CNN module, we follow (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) and use convolutional kernels of size  $3 \times 3$ .  $2 \times 2$  maxpoolings are used as intermediate pooling, and  $8 \times 8$  poolings (average or max) are applied after the final L-RNN. The example networks (A,B,C) are composed of only 5 convolutional layers. In D,E,F, we gradually increase the network depth. The difference in these networks (A,B,C) lies in the type of skip layers. Network A follows the traditional CNNs with pure feed-forward layers, Network B uses concatenation as an alternative, and Network C follows the idea of residual networks proposed in (He et al. (2016b)), the number of filters is gradually increased as the networks get deeper. To match dimensions for summation,  $1 \times 1$  convolution is used in Network C. In our experiments, we found that concatenation works better than sum as shown in Table 1. Therefore, in Networks D, E, F, we choose to use skip layers with concatenation. To avoid increasing the number of parameters as the networks going deep, we alternate between concatenation and forward modules. We also include a variation on Network B, called B_2LRNNs, where two L-RNNs are cascaded after the CNN. We test both vanilla RNNs and GRUs for the 1D spatial RNNs, ReLU is used for both cases as the non-linear activation. As a baseline, that does not include a L-RNN, we include a network composed of 7 convolutional layers, with concatenation used at every skip layer. To aggregate the global information, both max pooling and average pooling are tested as the last layer. In training, to avoid overfitting, we use dropout (0.5) right before the softmax prediction layer. We apply Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016) during training of vanilla RNNs. More training details and details of the recurrent units are described in the Appendix A

Dataset & Evaluation. We conducted experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 40k training images, 10k validation and 10k testing images in 10 classes, and each of the image is of  $32 \times 32$  pixels with RGB channels. We augment the training data with simple transformations (rotation, flipping) on the fly. The mean image over the whole training set is subtracted from each image during training. Following the standard evaluation protocol, we report the top1 error on the testing set.

Results & Discussion. In these experiments, we show that L-RNN blocks can be stacked on top of CNNs as an alternative to fully connected layer or average pooling to capture global information,

![](images/a79fb158c884c8da937e47825724d0cbd895231513d730c432b3739c635b3b1a.jpg)

and trained together even for deep networks. We present detailed comparisons with other published methods in Table 1.

In the Baseline and Network B, we compare the cases of using max pooling or average pooling as the last layer. It is evident that max pooling performs better consistently. One possible explanation would be that for classification tasks decisions are based on the most salient features. Moreover, what is very clear is that shallow networks with L-RNN modules (architectures A, B and C) can achieve comparable or superior performance to deep architectures with 19 layers and requiring more parameters (e.g. around 0.9M parameters for the B architecture with vanilla RNN compared to 2.3M or more for the 19 layer architectures). This confirms the design goal that L-RNN modules are able to add contextual information, avoiding the multiple layer route to increasing receptive fields in standard architectures, e.g. in (Romero et al., 2014; Srivastava et al., 2015). To our knowledge, this is the best result achieved with so few (only 5) convolutional layers and parameters (1M). From the time consumption perspective, direct comparison will be between baseline network and network B. The reason is that, L-RNN module is composed of a cascade of horizontal scans and vertical scans, which should be comparable with two convolutional layers. Surprisingly, when L-RNNs are stacked on top of CNN feature maps of spatial size  $8 \times 8$  pixels, Network-B-RNN is actually slightly faster than the Baseline (293s vs 331s), which is composed of pure convolutional layers. Comparing Network-B-GRU to Network-B-RNN, it can be seen that the number of parameters can be dramatically reduced (e.g. 1.95M to 0.9M) without sacrificing performance.

Note, we have only used mild augmentation, though, as practitioners know, extreme augmentation can always boost the performance on this small dataset.

All intermediate pooling layers are Max Poolings, while for the last pooling layer, we test both Max Pooling and Average Pooling. Recurrent Unit used in LRNNs: RNN: Vanilla RNN with ReLU non-linearity. GRU: Gated Recurrent Unit.

It is also worth noting that for shallow networks, the summing of residual connections (architecture C) shows no benefit compared to feed-forward or concatenation (A,B). Thus, as also employed in DenseNet or U-Net (Huang et al., 2016; Ronneberger et al., 2015), concatenation can be used as an alternative to summation in building deeper networks. As expected, deeper networks can always improve the classification performance (going from architecture D to F). Network F with only 19 convolutional layers performs (though more parameters) better than the ResNet-110 (by  $0.3\%$  top1 error), and is slightly worse than ResNet-164 (by  $0.25\%$  top1 error). Thus, whilst deep CNNs like ResNet provide non-linearities between layers, L-RNN modules can provide non-linearity within layers, so even shallow networks can achieve a good performance.

# 5.2 SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION

In this section, we insert L-RNN modules into the VGG-16 networks (pre-trained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009)), and fine-tune the entire network for the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation task. The objective is to boost the segmentation performance by providing contextual information via the L-RNNs. In particular, we consider the two FCN segmentation architectures originally introduced by Long et al. (2015), FCN-32s and FCN-8s; these are described below.

We proceed in three steps: first, we establish strong baselines by training our own FCN-32s and FCN-8s (Appendix C), and comparing their performance to those of (Long et al., 2015). We also investigate the loss in performance as the fully connected (FC) layer is gradually reduced from 4096 to 512 channels. The reason for doing this is that when we insert the L-RNN module, its complexity (dimension of the hidden units) depends on this number of channels, and so the overall complexity can be varied. In the second step, we insert L-RNNs into the FCN-32s architecture and evaluate the change in performance. Finally, we insert L-RNNs into the FCN-8s architecture and compare with previous published methods.

Dataset & Evaluation. We used a training set consisted of VOC2012 training data (1464 images provided by the challenge organizers), and augmented with training and validation data from Hariharan et al. (2014), which further extend the training set to a total of 11,685 images with pixel-level annotation. After removing the overlapping images between VOC2012 validation data and

this dataset, we are left with 346 images from the original VOC2012 validation set to validate our model. In all the following experiments, we use a single scale for the input images  $(384 \times 384)$ , and only horizontal flipping is used for data augmentation. The performance is measured in terms of pixel intersection-over-union (IOU) averaged across the 21 classes.

# 5.2.1 BASELINE ARCHITECTURES AND TRAINING

Architecture & Training In the FCN-32s, input images are passed through the whole networks, and end up with predictions of  $12 \times 12 \times 21$ , then, up-sampling layers are directly used to map the predictions back to  $384 \times 384$  (32 times). In the FCN-16s, instead of directly up-sampling 32 times, the predictions are first up-sampled by 2, and summed up with stream predictions from pool4 (named after VGG16), then up-sampled by 16 times. In the FCN-8s, the stream predictions from pool3 are further added to the results from FCN-16s, thus, up-sampling layers with only factor 8 is needed. (Appendix C)

For all the architectures, the base net(VGG16) is pre-trained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), we further train on Pascal VOC2012 for 50 epochs, similar to the experiment for CIFAR-10, we iteratively increase or decrease the learning rate between  $10^{-3}$  and  $10^{-5}$  after every 10 epochs. The 4096 channel architectures are trained first, and then the number of channels is gradually reduced in the FC layer by randomly cutting them (e.g. from 4096 to 2048), and re-training the networks.

Results & Discussion. Table 2 shows the performance of the six baselines: FCN-32s and FCN-8s with the number of channels varying from 512 to 4096. We observe that reducing the nodes in the FC layers does produce a performance drop (from 4096 to 1024 nodes,  $1\%$  mean IOU) in both FCN-32s and FCN-8s. Although from 1024 to 4096 nodes, the improvement is tiny, the difference in the number of parameters is over 64 million. Consequently, in the following experiments we choose to perform experiments based on networks with 512, 1024 or 2048 channels only (i.e. not 4096). In comparison to the original performance for the FCN-8s architecture in (Long et al., 2015), we exceed this (by 64.4 to 61.3 mean IOU) in our training. Thus, we certainly have a strong baseline.

# 5.2.2 FCN-32s WITH L-RNN MODULES

Architecture & Training The architecture FCN-32s(L-RNN) is shown in figure 5, the convolutional part of the architecture is initialized with the pre-trained FCN-32s (2048 channels in FC layer) baseline. Then, two 1D spatial RNNs are inserted into the fc1 layer in the horizontal direction, and two 1D spatial RNNs are inserted into the fc2 layer in the vertical direction. The convolution activations of fc1 are shared for both left-right and right-left scanning. Similarly for fc2, the convolution activations are shared for up-down and down-up scanning. Thus the fc1 and fc2 layers together with the added 1D spatial RNNs form a complete L-RNN module.

During training, as described in section 4, the 1D spatial RNNs are initialized with a zero recurrence matrix. The entire network is then fine-tuned end-to-end with the PASCAL VOC2012 data. We adopt RMS-prop (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) for 30 epochs with hyper-parameters  $lr = 10^{-4}$ ,  $\rho = 0.9$ ,  $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$ , then decrease the learning rate to  $lr = 10^{-5}$  for 10 epochs.

Results & Discussion The results are shown in Table 2. Compare the 32s rows with and without the L-RNN for the FC layers with 512, 1024, and 2048 channels. As can be seen, the addition of the L-RNN always improves the segmentation performance over the pre-trained FCN-32s baselines. However, the improvement is not large – about  $1 - 1.5\%$  mean IOU. This is because the receptive field in the fully connected layers of FCN-32s is sufficiently large to cover  $224 \times 224$  pixels of the input patch, and consequently the networks are not able to benefit much from the context provided by the L-RNN. The benefit is greater when L-RNNs are added to the lower layers (where the receptive fields of the convolutions are much smaller), and we turn to that case next.

# 5.2.3 FCN-8S WITH L-RNN MODULES

Architecture & Training The architecture FCN-8s(L-RNN) is shown in figure 5, as with the FCN-32s architecture, 1D spatial RNNs are inserted into the fc1 and fc2 layers to form a L-RNN module. L-RNNs are also inserted into the lower layers, namely pool3 and pool4 layers. Unlike the FC layers in the FCN-32s, where prediction for each central pixel comes from image patches of

Kernel Sizes for the fully connected layers (n is an experimental variable- number of channels) :

$$
\operatorname {f c} 1: 7 \times 7 \times 5 1 2 \times n, \quad \operatorname {f c} 2: 1 \times 1 \times n \times n, \quad \operatorname {f c} 3: 1 \times 1 \times n \times 2 1
$$

$$
\mathrm {f c} 4: 1 \times 1 \times 5 1 2 \times 1 0 2 4, \quad \mathrm {f c} 5: 1 \times 1 \times 1 0 2 4 \times 1 0 2 4, \quad \mathrm {f c} 6: 1 \times 1 \times 1 0 2 4 \times 2 1
$$

$$
\mathrm {f c} 7: 1 \times 1 \times 2 5 6 \times 1 0 2 4, \quad \mathrm {f c} 8: 1 \times 1 \times 1 0 2 4 \times 1 0 2 4, \quad \mathrm {f c} 9: 1 \times 1 \times 1 0 2 4 \times 2 1
$$

size  $224 \times 224$ , the predictions from pool3 and pool4 are based on receptive field on the image of much smaller sizes (around  $44 \times 44$  and  $100 \times 100$  pixels respectively). Thus, the inserted L-RNN Modules must be able to model relatively long-range dependencies.

During training, the network is initialized from the FCN-8s baseline, and then fine-tuned using segmentation data. Again the PASCAL VOC dataset is used. Furthermore, when comparing to the other previously published methods, the network is further trained on the COCO trainval dataset, and we use a densely connected CRF as post-processing (Krhenbhl & Koltun, 2012).

Results on PASCAL VOC Validation set The results are shown in Table 2. Compare the rows with 2048 channels for 32s with and without L-RNN, to those for 8s with and without L-RNN. It can be seen (for IOU) that going from FCN-32s (62.7) to FCN-8s (64.1) brings an improvement due to the skip layers. However, adding in the L-RNNs brings an improvement from 64.2 for FCN-32s-L-RNN to the very high value of 69.2 for FCN-8s-L-RNN. The reason for this substantial improvement is that when inserting the L-RNN after pool3 and pool4 in FCN-8s, the L-RNN is able to learn contextual information over a much larger range than the receptive field of pure local convolutions. As noted earlier, in the FCN-32s architecture the L-RNN is inserted in the FC layers, and their receptive field already covers the input patch of size  $224 \times 224$  (less context to contribute here).

Results on PASCAL VOC Test set Table 3 shows the results of the FCN-8s with L-RNNs on the PASCAL VOC test data, and also compares to others who have published on this dataset. The performance is far superior to the original result (Long et al., 2015) using a FCN-8s with 4096 channels (whereas only 2048 channels are used here). We also compare to the dilated convolution network of (Yu & Koltun, 2016), obtaining comparable, though slightly better performance. Note that in (Yu & Koltun, 2016), multi-scale contextual information is captured by explicitly designing dilated convolution kernels, while the L-RNN is able to learn contextual information implicitly. Finally, we compare to (Zheng et al., 2015) who add a densely connected CRF to FCN-8s. If we also add a dense CRF as post-processing, we boost the performance by  $1\%$  in IOU (the same boost as obtained by (Yu & Koltun, 2016)). In Figure 6, we show the samples of semantic segmentations on

Comparing with the end-to-end trainable CRF-RNN (Zheng et al., 2015), our predictions miss the small details, like the wheel of the bicycle, but show much better performance in determining the class of the segmented regions – something that context can really contribute to.

# 6 CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK

This paper has shown that the L-RNN is an alternative way of adding multi-scale spatial context to a network. In fact, L-RNNs can be used to give shallow networks the receptive fields of far deeper networks. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that inserting L-RNNs can boost the performance of pre-trained networks, and given an initialization procedure that makes this training a simple matter of end-to-end fine tuning.

There is much left to investigate using L-RNNs as a new building block, and we suggest some avenues here: (i) in addition to making the L-RNN function as a fully connected layer or average pooling, inserting L-RNNs into intermediate layers will also be interesting to explore. So, hybrid architectures that interleave CNNs with L-RNN at different layers of a deep network, e.g. for the application of ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) classification; (ii) a similar investigation for deep residual networks where the residual blocks are either convolutional or L-RNNs; and (iii) including a CRF final layer in end-to-end training.
