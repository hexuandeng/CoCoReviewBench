# ABSTRACT

The goal of this paper is to study why typical neural networks train so fast, and how neural network architecture affects the speed of training. We introduce a simple concept called gradient confusion to help formally analyze this. When confusion is high, stochastic gradients produced by different data samples may be negatively correlated, slowing down convergence. But when gradient confusion is low, data samples interact harmoniously, and training proceeds quickly. Through novel theoretical and experimental results, we show how the neural net architecture affects gradient confusion, and thus the efficiency of training. We show that increasing the width of neural networks leads to lower gradient confusion, and thus easier model training. On the other hand, increasing the depth of neural networks has the opposite effect. Finally, we observe empirically that techniques like batch normalization and skip connections reduce gradient confusion, which helps reduce the training burden of very deep networks.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Robbins & Monro, 1951) and its variants with momentum (Sutskever et al., 2013) have become the standard optimization routine for neural networks due to their fast convergence and good generalization properties (Wilson et al., 2017; Keskar & Socher, 2017; Sutskever et al., 2013). Yet the behavior of SGD on high-dimensional neural network models still eludes full theoretical understanding, both in terms of its convergence and generalization properties. In this paper, we study why SGD is so efficient at converging to low loss values on most standard neural networks, and how neural net architecture design affects training performance.

Classical stochastic optimization theory predicts that the learning rate of SGD needs to decrease over time for convergence to be guaranteed to the minimizer of a convex function (Shamir & Zhang, 2013; Bertsekas, 2011). For strongly convex functions for example, such results show that a decreasing learning rate schedule of  $O(1 / k)$  is required to guarantee convergence to within  $\epsilon$ -accuracy of the minimizer in  $O(1 / \epsilon)$  iterations, where  $k$  denotes the iteration number. Such decay schemes, however, typically lead to poor performance on standard neural network problems. Neural networks operate in a regime where the number of parameters is much larger than the number of training data. In this regime, SGD seems to converge quickly with constant learning rates. Most neural net practitioners use a constant learning rate for the majority of training, with exponentially decaying learning rate schedules at the end, without seeing the method stall (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2016; Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). With constant learning rates, theoretical guarantees show that SGD converges quickly to a neighborhood of the minimizer, but then reaches a noise floor beyond which it stops converging; this noise floor depends on the learning rate and the variance of the gradients (Moulines & Bach, 2011; Needell et al., 2014). Some more recent results have shown that when models can fit the data completely while being strongly convex, convergence without a noise floor is possible without decaying the learning rate (Schmidt & Roux, 2013; Ma et al., 2017; Bassily et al., 2018; Vaswani et al., 2018).

While these results do give important insights, they do not fully explain the dynamics of SGD on neural nets, and how they relate to overparameterization. Training performance is also highly affected by the neural network architecture. It is common knowledge among neural network practitioners that deeper networks train slower (Bengio et al., 1994; Glorot & Bengio, 2010). This has led to several innovations over the years to get deeper networks to train more easily, such as careful initialization strategies (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; He et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019), residual connections (He et al.,

2016), and various normalization schemes like batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) and weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016). Furthermore, there is ample evidence to indicate that wider networks are easier to train (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016; Nguyen & Hein, 2017; Lee et al., 2019), and recent theoretical results suggest that the dynamics of SGD simplify considerably for very wide networks (Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019). Several prior works have investigated the difficulties of training deep networks (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; Balduzzi et al., 2017), and the benefits of width (Nguyen & Hein, 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Du et al., 2018; Allen-Zhu et al., 2018). This work advances the existing literature by identifying and analyzing a condition that enables us to theoretically and empirically establish novel direct relationships between layer width, network depth, problem dimensionality, and SGD dynamics on overparameterized networks.

Our contributions. Typical neural nets are overparameterized (i.e., the number of parameters exceed the number of training points). In this paper, we ask how this overparameterization, and more specifically the architecture of a neural net, affects the dynamics of SGD. We answer this question through extensive theoretical and experimental studies and show how network width, depth, batch normalization and skip connections affect the dynamics. We emphasize that our main contributions are conceptual. In particular, following are our main contributions.<sup>1</sup>

- We identify a condition, termed gradient confusion, that impacts the convergence properties of SGD on overparameterized models. We prove that high gradient confusion may lead to slower convergence, while convergence is accelerated (and could be faster than predicted by existing theory) if confusion is low indicating a regime where constant learning rates work well in practice (sections 2 and 3). We use this gradient confusion condition as the main proxy, to study the effect of various architecture choices on convergence.  
- We study the effect of neural net architecture on gradient confusion (section 4), and prove (a) gradient confusion increases as the network depth increases, and (b) wider networks have lower gradient confusion. This indicates that deeper networks are more difficult to train and wider networks become easier to train. Directly analyzing the gradient confusion bound enables us to derive novel and tight results on the direct effect of depth and width, without requiring arguably restrictive assumptions like infinitely wide networks (Schoenholz et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2019). Our results hold for a large family of neural networks with non-linear activations and a large class of loss-functions.  
- We test our theoretical predictions using extensive experiments on wide residual networks (WRNs) (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), convolutional networks (CNNs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for image classification tasks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and MNIST (section 5 and appendix A). We find that our theoretical results consistently hold across all our experiments. We further show that innovations like batch normalization and skip connections in residual networks help lower gradient confusion, thus indicating why standard neural networks that employ such techniques are so efficiently trained using SGD.

# 2 GRADIENT CONFUSION

Notations. We denote vectors in bold lower-case and matrices in bold upper-case. We use  $(\mathbf{W})_{i,j}$  to indicate the  $(i,j)$  cell in matrix  $\mathbf{W}$  and  $(\mathbf{W})_i$  for the  $i^{\mathrm{th}}$  row of matrix  $\mathbf{W}$ .  $\| \mathbf{W}\|$  denotes the operator norm of  $\mathbf{W}$ .  $[N]$  denotes  $\{1,2,\dots ,N\}$  and  $[N]_0$  denotes  $\{0,1,\ldots ,N\}$ .

Preliminaries. Given  $N$  training points (specified by the corresponding loss functions  $\{f_i\}_{i\in [N]}$ ), we use SGD to solve empirical risk minimization problems of the form,

$$
\min  _ {\mathbf {w} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} F (\mathbf {w}) := \min  _ {\mathbf {w} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} f _ {i} (\mathbf {w}), \tag {1}
$$

using the following iterative update rule for  $T$  rounds:

$$
\mathbf {w} _ {k + 1} = \mathbf {w} _ {k} - \alpha \nabla \tilde {f} _ {k} \left(\mathbf {w} _ {k}\right). \tag {2}
$$

Here  $\alpha$  is the learning rate and  $\tilde{f}_k$  is a function chosen uniformly at random from  $\{f_i\}_{i \in [N]}$  at iteration  $k \in [T]$ . We use  $\mathbf{w}^{\star}$  to denote the optimal solution, i.e.,  $\mathbf{w}^{\star} = \arg \min_{\mathbf{w}} F(\mathbf{w})$ .

Gradient confusion. SGD works by iteratively selecting a random function  $\tilde{f}_k$ , and modifying the parameters to move in the direction of the negative gradient of the objective term  $\tilde{f}_k$ . It may happen that the selected gradient  $\nabla \tilde{f}_k$  is negatively correlated with the gradient of another term  $\nabla f_j$ . When the gradients of different mini-batches are negatively correlated, the objective terms disagree on which direction the parameters should move, and we say that there is gradient confusion.

Definition 2.1. A set of objective functions  $\{f_i\}_{i\in [N]}$  has gradient confusion bound  $\eta \geq 0$  if the pair-wise inner products between gradients satisfy, for a fixed  $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ ,

$$
\langle \nabla f _ {i} (\mathbf {w}), \nabla f _ {j} (\mathbf {w}) \rangle \geq - \eta , \forall i \neq j \in [ N ]. \tag {3}
$$

SGD converges fast when gradient confusion is low. To see why, consider the case of training a logistic regression model on a dataset with orthogonal vectors. We have  $f_{i}(\mathbf{w}) = \ell (y_{i}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\top}\mathbf{w})$ , where  $\ell :\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$  is the logistic loss,  $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i\in [N]}$  is a set of orthogonal training vectors, and  $y_{i}\in \{-1,1\}$  is the label for the  $i^{\mathrm{th}}$  training example. We then have  $\nabla f_{i}(\mathbf{w}) = \zeta_{i}\mathbf{x}_{i}$ , where  $\zeta_{i} = y_{i}\ell^{\prime}(y_{i}\cdot \mathbf{x}_{i}^{\top}\mathbf{w})$ . Note that the gradient confusion is 0 since  $\langle \nabla f_i(\mathbf{w}),\nabla f_j(\mathbf{w})\rangle = \zeta_i\zeta_j\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j\rangle = 0, \forall i,j\in [N]$  and  $i\neq j$ . Thus, an update in the gradient direction  $f_{i}$  has no effect on the loss value of  $f_{j}$  for  $i\neq j$ . In this case, SGD decouples into (deterministic) gradient descent on each objective term

separately, and we can expect to see the fast convergence rates attained by gradient descent.

Can we expect a problem to have low gradient confusion in practice? From the logistic regression problem, we have:  $|\langle \nabla f_i(\mathbf{w}), \nabla f_j(\mathbf{w}) \rangle| = |\langle \mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j \rangle| \cdot |\zeta_i \zeta_j|$ . This inner product is expected to be small for all w; the logistic loss satisfies  $|\zeta_i \zeta_j| < 1$ , and for fixed  $N$  the quantity  $\max_{ij} |\langle \mathbf{x}_j, \mathbf{x}_i \rangle|$  is  $O(1 / \sqrt{d})$  whenever  $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}$  are randomly sampled from a sphere (see lemma B.1 for the formal statement). Thus, we would expect a random linear model to have nearly orthogonal gradients, when the number of parameters is "large" and the number of training data is "small", i.e., when the model is over-parameterized. This is further evidenced by a toy example in figure 1, where we show a slightly overparameterized linear regression model can have much faster convergence rates, as well as lower gradient confusion, compared to the underparameterized model.

Now consider more general neural net problems. There is evidence that the Hessian at the minimizer is very low rank for many standard overparameterized neural net models (Sagun et al., 2017; Cooper, 2018; Chaudhari et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017; Ghorbani et al., 2019). What does this imply for the gradient confusion? For clarity in presentation, suppose each  $f_{i}$  has a minimizer at the origin (the same argument can be easily extended to the more general case). Suppose also that there is a Lipschitz constant for the Hessian of each function  $f_{i}$  that satisfies  $\| \mathbf{H}_i(\mathbf{w}) - \mathbf{H}_i(\mathbf{w}')\| \leq L_H\| \mathbf{w} - \mathbf{w}'\|$ . Then  $\nabla f_{i}(\mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{H}_{i}\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{e}$ , where  $\mathbf{e}$  is an error term bounded as:  $\| \mathbf{e}\| \leq \frac{1}{2} L_H\| \mathbf{w}\| ^2$ , and we use the shorthand  $\mathbf{H}_i$  to denote  $\mathbf{H}_i(\mathbf{0})$ . Then we have (appendix C):

$$
| \langle \nabla f _ {i} (\mathbf {w}), \nabla f _ {j} (\mathbf {w}) \rangle | \leq \| \mathbf {w} \| ^ {2} \| \mathbf {H} _ {i} \| \| \mathbf {H} _ {j} \| + \frac {1}{2} L _ {H} \| \mathbf {w} \| ^ {3} (\| \mathbf {H} _ {i} \| + \| \mathbf {H} _ {j} \|) + \frac {1}{4} L _ {H} ^ {2} \| \mathbf {w} \| ^ {4}.
$$

If the Hessians are sufficiently random and low-rank (e.g., of the form  $\mathbf{H}_i = \mathbf{a}_i\mathbf{a}_i^\top$  where  $\mathbf{a}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times r}$  are randomly sampled from a unit sphere), then one would expect the terms in this expression to be small for all  $\mathbf{w}$  within a neighborhood of the minimizer. This indicates that for many standard neural network models, the gradient confusion might be low for a large class of weights near the minimizer.

The above arguments are rather informal, and ignore issues like the effect of the structure of neural networks. In the following sections, we rigorously analyze the effect of gradient confusion on the speed of convergence on non-convex problems, and the effect of width and depth of the neural net architecture on the gradient confusion.

# 3 SGD IS EFFICIENT WHEN GRADIENT CONFUSION IS LOW

Several prior papers have analyzed the convergence rates of constant learning rate SGD (Nedic & Bertsekas, 2001; Moulines & Bach, 2011; Needell et al., 2014; Dieuleveut et al., 2017). These results show that for strongly convex and Lipschitz smooth functions, SGD with a constant learning rate  $\alpha$  converges linearly to a neighborhood of the minimizer. The noise floor it converges to depends on the learning rate  $\alpha$  and the variance of the gradients at the minimizer, i.e.,  $\mathbb{E}_i\| \nabla f_i(\mathbf{w}^\star)\|^2$ . To guarantee convergence to  $\epsilon$ -accuracy in such a setting, the learning rate needs to be small, i.e.,  $\alpha = O(\epsilon)$ , and the method requires  $T = O(1 / \epsilon)$  iterations. Some more recent results show convergence of constant learning rate SGD without a noise floor and without small step sizes for models that can completely fit the data (Schmidt & Roux, 2013; Ma et al., 2017; Bassily et al., 2018; Vaswani et al., 2018).

The gradient confusion bound is related to these classical results. Cauchy-Swartz inequality implies that if  $\mathbb{E}_i\| \nabla f_i(\mathbf{w}^\star)\|^2 = O(\epsilon)$ , then  $\mathbb{E}_{i,j}|\langle \nabla f_i(\mathbf{w}^\star),\nabla f_j(\mathbf{w}^\star)\rangle | = O(\epsilon),\forall i,j$ . Thus the gradient confusion at the minimizer is small when the variance of the gradients at the minimizer is small. Further note that when the variance of the gradients at the minimizer is  $O(\epsilon)$ , a direct application of the results in (Moulines & Bach, 2011; Needell et al., 2014) shows that constant learning rate SGD has fast convergence to  $\epsilon$ -accuracy in  $T = O(\log (1 / \epsilon))$  iterations, without the learning rate needing to be small. Generally however, bounded gradient confusion does not provide a bound on the variance of the gradients (see appendix G for more discussion). Thus, it is instructive to derive convergence bounds of SGD explicitly in terms of the gradient confusion to properly understand its effect.

We begin by considering functions satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality (Lojasiewicz, 1965), a condition related to, but weaker than, strong convexity, and provide bounds on the rate of convergence in terms of the optimality gap. Then we look at a broader class of smooth non-convex functions, and analyze convergence to a stationary point. We first make two standard assumptions.

(A1)  $\{f_i\}_{i\in [N]}$  are Lipschitz smooth:  $f_{i}(\mathbf{w}^{\prime})\leq f_{i}(\mathbf{w}) + \nabla f_{i}(\mathbf{w})^{\top}(\mathbf{w}^{\prime} - \mathbf{w}) + \frac{L}{2}\| \mathbf{w}^{\prime} - \mathbf{w}\|^{2}$ .  
(A2)  $\{f_i\}_{i\in [N]}$  satisfy the  $PL$  inequality:  $\frac{1}{2}\| \nabla f_i(\mathbf{w})\|^2\geq \mu (f_i(\mathbf{w}) - f_i^\star)$ ,  $f_{i}^{\star} = \min_{\mathbf{w}}f_{i}(\mathbf{w})$

Theorem 3.1. If the objective function satisfies (A1) and (A2), and has gradient confusion  $\eta$ , SGD with updates of the form (2) converges linearly to a neighborhood of the minima of problem (1) as:

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ F \left(\mathbf {w} _ {T}\right) - F ^ {\star} \right] \leq \rho^ {T} \left(F \left(\mathbf {w} _ {0}\right) - F ^ {\star}\right) + \frac {\alpha \eta}{1 - \rho},
$$

where  $\alpha < \frac{2}{NL}$ ,  $\rho = 1 - \frac{2\mu}{N}\left(\alpha - \frac{NL\alpha^2}{2}\right)$ ,  $F^{\star} = \min_{\mathbf{w}} F(\mathbf{w})$  and  $\mathbf{w}_0$  is the initialized weights.

This result shows that SGD converges linearly to a neighborhood of a minimizer, and the size of this neighborhood depends on the level of gradient confusion. When the gradient confusion is small, i.e.,  $\eta = O(\epsilon)$ , SGD has fast convergence to  $O(\epsilon)$ -accuracy in  $T = O(\log(1/\epsilon))$  iterations, without requiring the learning rate to be vanishingly small. We now extend this to general smooth functions.

Theorem 3.2. If the objective satisfies (A1) and has gradient confusion bound  $\eta$ , then SGD converges to a neighborhood of a stationary point as:

$$
\min _ {k = 1, \dots , T} \mathbb {E} \| \nabla F (\mathbf {w} _ {k}) \| ^ {2} \leq \frac {\rho (F (\mathbf {w} _ {1}) - F ^ {\star})}{T} + \rho \eta ,
$$

for learning rate  $\alpha < \frac{2}{NL}$ ,  $\rho = \frac{2N}{2 - NL\alpha}$ , and  $F^{\star} = \min_{\mathbf{w}} F(\mathbf{w})$ .

Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 predict an initial phase of optimization with fast convergence to the neighborhood of a minimizer or a stationary point. This behavior is often observed when optimizing neural nets (Darken & Moody, 1992; Sutskever et al., 2013), where a constant learning rate reaches a high level of accuracy on the model. As we show in subsequent sections, this is expected since for neural networks typically used, the gradient confusion is expected to be low. Convergence slows down as the iterates approach the noise floor, and at this point typically practitioners employ exponentially decaying learning rate schedules (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2016; Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016; Ge et al., 2019). See appendix G for more discussion on theorems 3.1 and 3.2, and how they relate to results in previous works. We stress that our goal is not to study convergence rates per se, nor is it to prove state-of-the-art rate bounds for this class of problems. The main intention is to show the direct effect that the gradient confusion bound has on the convergence rate and the noise floor that constant learning rate SGD converges to. As we show in the following sections, this new perspective in terms of the gradient confusion helps us more directly understand how neural net architecture design affects SGD dynamics and why.

# 4 EFFECT OF NEURAL NET ARCHITECTURE ON GRADIENT CONFUSION

To draw a rigorous connection between neural net structure and training performance, we analyze gradient confusion for generic (i.e., random) model problems using methods from high-dimensional probability. In particular, this section considers the following scenarios: (a) Random data drawn from a unit sphere and the weights in a ball around the local minimizer (theorem 4.1 and corollary 4.1). (b) Random weights using standard initialization schemes and both arbitrary bounded data (theorem 4.2, part 1) and random data drawn from a unit sphere (theorem 4.2, part 2). Our results cover a wide range of scenarios compared to prior work (e.g., Chen et al. (2018); Schoenholz et al. (2016); Balduzzi et al. (2017)), require minimal additional assumptions, and hold for a large family of neural nets with non-linear activations and a large class of loss-functions. In particular, our results hold for fully connected networks (and convolutional networks in some cases) with the square-loss and logistic-loss functions, and commonly used non-linear activations such as sigmoid, tanh and ReLU.

(a) Random Data, Bounded Weights Around Minimizer. In this subsection, we consider training data of the form  $\mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{x}_i))\}_{i\in [N]}$ , for some labeling function  $\mathcal{C}:\mathbb{R}^d\to [-1,1]$ , and with data points  $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}$  drawn uniformly from the surface of a  $d$ -dimensional unit sphere. The labeling function satisfies  $|\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{x})|\leq 1$  and  $\| \nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{x})\|_2\leq 1$  for  $\| \mathbf{x}\| \leq 1$ . Note that this automatically holds for every model considered in this paper where the labeling function is realizable (i.e., where the model can express the labeling function using its parameters). More generally, this assumes a Lipschitz condition on the labels (i.e., the labels don't change too quickly with the inputs). In this paper, we consider two loss-functions, namely, square-loss for regression and logistic loss function for classification. The square-loss function is defined as  $f_{i}(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2} (\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{x}_i) - g_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x}_i))^2$  and the logistic function is defined as  $f_{i}(\mathbf{w}) = \log (1 + \exp (-\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{x}_{i})g_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x}_{i})))$ . Here,  $g_{\mathbf{w}}:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}$  denotes the parameterized function we fit to the training data and  $f_{i}(\mathbf{w})$  denotes the loss-function of hypothesis  $g_{\mathbf{w}}$  on data point  $\mathbf{x}_i$ .

Formally, let  $\mathbf{W}_0\in \mathbb{R}^{\ell_1\times d}$  and  $\{\mathbf{W}_p\}_{p\in [\beta ]}$  such that  $\mathbf{W}_p\in \mathbb{R}^{\ell_p\times \ell_{p - 1}}$  be the given weight matrices. Let  $\mathbf{W}$  denote the tuple  $(\mathbf{W}_p)_{p\in [\beta ]_0}$ . Define  $\ell \coloneqq \max_{p\in [\beta ]}\ell_p$  to be the width and  $\beta$  to be the depth of the neural network. Then, the model  $g_{\mathbf{W}}$  is defined as

$$
g _ {\mathbf {W}} (\mathbf {x}) := \sigma \left(\mathbf {W} _ {\beta} \sigma \left(\mathbf {W} _ {\beta - 1} \dots \sigma \left(\mathbf {W} _ {1} \sigma \left(\mathbf {W} _ {0} \mathbf {x}\right)\right) \dots\right)\right), \tag {4}
$$

where  $\sigma$  denotes the non-linear activation function applied point-wise to its arguments. We assume that the non-linear activation is given by a function  $\sigma(x)$  with the following properties.

- (P1) Boundedness:  $|\sigma(x)| \leq 1$  for vector  $x \in [-1, 1]$ .  
- (P2) Bounded differentials: Let  $\sigma'(x)$  and  $\sigma''(x)$  denote the first and second subdifferentials respectively. Then,  $|\sigma'(x)| \leq 1$  and  $|\sigma''(x)| \leq 1$  for all  $x \in [-1,1]$ .

When  $\| \mathbf{x} \| \leq 1$ , as in our random data model, activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh, softmax and ReLU satisfy these requirements. Additionally, we make the following assumption on the weights.

Assumption 1 (Small Weights). We assume that the operator norm of the weight matrices  $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i\in [\beta ]_0}$  are bounded above by 1. In other words, for every  $i\in [\beta ]_0$  we have  $\| \mathbf{W}_i\| \leq 1$

The operator norm of the weight matrices  $\| \mathbf{W}\|$  being close to 1 is important for the trainability of neural nets, as it ensures that the input signal is passed through the net without exploding or shrinking across layers (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). Proving non-vacuous bounds in case of such blow-ups in magnitude of the signal or the gradient is not possible in general, and thus, we consider this restricted class of weights. The small-weights assumption is not just a theoretical concern, but also usually enforced in practice using weight decay regularizers of the form  $\sum_{i}\| W_{i}\|_{F}^{2}$ , which keep the weights small during optimization. See appendix F for further discussion on the small weights assumption.

We now prove concentration bounds for the gradient confusion on neural nets.

Theorem 4.1. Consider the problem of training neural nets (equation 4) using either the square-loss or the logistic-loss function. Let  $\eta >0$  be a given constant. Let the weights satisfy assumption 1 and the non-linearities in each layer satisfy properties (P1) and (P2). For some fixed constant  $c > 0$ , the gradient confusion bound in equation 3 holds with probability at least

$$
1 - N ^ {2} \exp \left(\frac {- c d \eta^ {2}}{1 6 \zeta_ {0} ^ {4} (\beta + 2) ^ {4}}\right),
$$

For both the square-loss and the logistic-loss functions,  $\zeta_0\leq 2\sqrt{\beta}$  (from lemma D.1).

Thus, theorem 4.1 shows that, for a given dimension  $d$  and number of samples  $N$ , when the network depth  $\beta$  decreases, the probability that the gradient confusion bound in equation 3 holds increases, and vice versa. Note that the convergence rate results of SGD in section 3 assume that the gradient confusion bound holds at every point along the path of SGD. On the other hand, theorem 4.1 shows concentration bounds for the gradient confusion at a fixed weight  $\mathbf{W}$ . Thus, to ensure that the above result is relevant for the convergence of SGD on overparameterized models, we now make the concentration bound in theorem 4.1 uniform over all weights inside a ball  $\mathcal{B}_r$  of radius  $r$ .

Corollary 4.1 (Uniform concentration for all weights around the minimizer). Select a point  $\mathbf{W} = (\mathbf{W}_0, \mathbf{W}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{W}_\beta)$ , satisfying assumption 1. Consider a ball  $\mathcal{B}_r$  centered at  $\mathbf{W}$  of radius  $r > 0$ . If the data  $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i \in [N]}$  are sampled uniformly from a unit sphere, then the gradient confusion bound in equation 3 holds uniformly at all points  $\mathbf{W}' \in \mathcal{B}_r$  with probability at least

$$
1 - N ^ {2} \exp \left(- \frac {c d \eta^ {2}}{6 4 \zeta_ {0} ^ {4} (\beta + 2) ^ {4}}\right), \quad \text {i f} r \leq \eta / 4 \zeta_ {0} ^ {2},
$$

$$
1 - N ^ {2} \exp \left(- \frac {c d \eta^ {2}}{6 4 \zeta_ {0} ^ {4} (\beta + 2) ^ {4}} + \frac {8 d \zeta_ {0} ^ {2} r}{\eta}\right), \qquad o t h e r w i s e.
$$

Thus, corollary 4.1 shows that the probability that the gradient confusion bound holds decreases with increasing depth, for all weights in a ball around the minimizer. This explains why training very deep models is hard and typically slow with SGD (Bengio et al., 1994; Glorot & Bengio, 2010). Note that this is also related to the shattered gradients phenomenon (Balduzzi et al., 2017) that arises with depth (see appendix H for more discussion). This naturally raises the question why modern deep neural networks are so efficiently trained using SGD. While careful initialization strategies prevent vanishing or exploding gradients making deeper networks trainable, these strategies still suffer from high gradient confusion for very deep networks (as we show below in theorem 4.2). Thus, in section 5, we empirically study how popular techniques like skip connections (He et al., 2016) and batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) affect gradient confusion. We find that these techniques drastically lower gradient confusion, making very deep networks significantly easier to train. Note that the above results automatically hold for convolutional nets, since a convolution operation on  $\mathbf{x}$  can be represented as a matrix multiplication  $\mathbf{U}\mathbf{x}$  for an appropriate Toeplitz matrix  $\mathbf{U}$ .

(b) Standard Weight Initializations and the Effect of Layer Width. Note that on assuming  $\| \mathbf{W}\| \leq 1$  for each weight matrix  $\mathbf{W}$  in our results in part 1 of section 4, the dependence of gradient confusion on the layer width goes away in general. A simple example that illustrates this is to consider the case where each weight matrix in the neural network has exactly one non-zero element, which is set to 1. The operator norm of each such weight matrix is 1, but the forward or backward propagated signals would not depend on the width. Thus, to better understand the effect of the layer width, in this subsection we focus on the behavior of neural nets at initialization by considering standard weight initialization strategies used when training neural nets. For completeness, we consider both the case where the data is arbitrary but bounded, as well as where the data is randomly drawn from a unit sphere. A key point used in the following results is that typical weight initialization techniques ensure that the operator norm is bounded by 1 with high probability, thus enabling us to derive tight bounds on the gradient confusion. We consider the following weight initialization strategy.

Strategy 4.1.  $\mathbf{W}_0\in \mathbb{R}^{\ell \times d}$  has independent  $\mathcal{N}(0,\frac{1}{d})$  entries. For every  $p\in [\beta ]$  , the weights  $\mathbf{W}_p\in \mathbb{R}^{\ell_p\times \ell_{p - 1}}$  have independent  $\mathcal{N}\left(0,\frac{1}{\kappa\ell_{p - 1}}\right)$  entries for some constant  $\kappa >0$

This initialization strategy with different settings of  $\kappa$  are used almost universally for neural networks (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; He et al., 2015). The following theorem shows how the width  $\ell := \max_{p \in [\beta]} \ell_p$  and the depth  $\beta$  affect the gradient confusion condition. In particular, as width increases or depth decreases the probability that the gradient confusion bound (equation 3) holds increases.

Theorem 4.2 (Neural nets with randomly chosen weights). Let  $\mathbf{W}_0, \mathbf{W}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{W}_\beta$  be weight matrices chosen according to strategy 4.1. There exists fixed constants  $c_1, c_2 > 0$  such that we have:

1. Consider a fixed but arbitrary dataset  $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N$  with  $\| \mathbf{x}_i \| \leq 1$  for every  $i \in [N]$ . For  $\eta > 4$  we have that the gradient confusion bound in equation 3 holds with probability at least  $1 - \beta \exp \left(-c_1 \kappa^2 \ell^2\right) - N^2 \exp \left(\frac{-cd(\eta - 4)^2}{64 \zeta_0^4 (\beta + 2)^4}\right)$ .

2. If the dataset  $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i\in [N]}$  is such that each  $\mathbf{x}_i$  is an i.i.d. sample from the surface of  $d$ -dimensional unit sphere, then for every  $\eta > 0$  the gradient confusion bound in equation 3 holds with probability at least  $1 - \beta \exp \left(-c_1\kappa^2\ell^2\right) - N^2\exp \left(\frac{-c_2d\eta^2}{16\zeta_0^4(\beta + 2)^4}\right)$ .

Thus, theorem 4.2 shows that the layer width improves the trainability of deep networks under most standard initialization techniques used. When the layers are very wide, other authors have shown that some of the benefits of width at initialization also persist during training, considerably simplifying the learning dynamics of SGD (Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019). In the next section (and in appendix A), we show substantial empirical evidence that, given a sufficiently deep network, increasing the layer width often helps in lowering gradient confusion and speeding up convergence for a range of neural network models, and that these effects persist throughout optimization for most models.

# 5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

To test our theoretical results and to probe why standard neural nets are efficiently trained with SGD, we now present experimental results showing the effect of the neural network architecture on the convergence of SGD and gradient confusion. It is worth noting that theorems 3.1 and 3.2 indicate that we would expect the effect of gradient confusion to be most prominent closer to the end of training.

We performed experiments on wide residual networks (WRNs) (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), convolutional networks (CNNs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for image classification tasks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and MNIST. We present results for CNNs on CIFAR-10 in this section, and present all other results in appendix A. We use CNN- $\beta$ - $\ell$  to denote WRNs that have no skip connections or batch normalization, with a depth  $\beta$  and width factor  $\ell$ .<sup>4</sup> We turned off dropout and weight decay for all our experiments. We used SGD as the optimizer without any momentum. Following Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016), we ran all experiments for 200 epochs with minibatches of size 128, and reduced the initial learning rate by a factor of 10 at epochs 80 and 160. We used the MSRA initializer (He et al., 2015) for the weights as is standard for this model, and used the same preprocessing steps for the CIFAR-10 images as described in Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016). We ran each experiment 5 times, and we show the standard deviation across runs in our plots. We tuned the optimal initial learning rate for each model over a logarithmically-spaced grid and selected the run that achieved the lowest training loss value. To measure gradient confusion, at the end of every training epoch, we sampled 100 pairs of mini-batches each of size 128 (the same size as the training batch size). We calculated gradients on each mini-batch, and then computed pairwise cosine similarities. See appendix A.2 for more details on the experimental setup and architectures used.

Effect of depth. To test our theoretical results, we consider CNNs with a fixed width factor of 2 and varying network depth. From figure 2, we see that our theoretical results are backed by the experiments: increasing depth slows down convergence, and increases gradient confusion. We also notice that with increasing depth, the density of pairwise gradient cosine similarities concentrates less sharply around 0 (indicating higher variance), which makes the network harder to train.

Effect of width. We now consider CNNs with a fixed depth of 16 and varying width factors. From figure 3, we see that increasing width results in faster convergence and lower gradient confusion.

We further see that gradient cosine similarities concentrate around 0 with growing width, indicating that SGD decouples across the training samples with growing width. Note that the smallest network considered is still overparameterized and achieves a high level of performance (see appendix A.3).

Effect of batch normalization and skip connections. To help understand why many standard deep nets are so efficiently trained using SGD, we test the effect of adding skip connections and batch normalization to CNNs of fixed width and varying depth. Figure 4 shows that adding skip connections or batch normalization individually help in training deeper models, but these models still suffer from worsening results and increasing gradient confusion as the network gets deeper. Both these techniques together keep the gradient confusion relatively low even for very deep networks, significantly improving trainability of deep models. Note that all these observations are consistent with previous work (Balduzzi et al., 2017; Santurkar et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019).

# 6 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we investigate how overparameterization and model architecture affect the dynamics of SGD on neural networks. To help formally analyze this, we introduce a concept called gradient confusion, and show that when gradient confusion is low, SGD experiences fast convergence. We then show that increasing layer width leads to lower gradient confusion, making the model easier to train. In contrast, increasing network depth results in higher gradient confusion, making deeper models harder to train. We further show how techniques like batch normalization and skip connections help in tackling this problem. Note that many previous results have shown how deeper models are more efficient at modeling higher complexity function classes than wider models, and thus depth is essential for the success of neural networks (Eldan & Shamir, 2016; Telgarsky, 2016; Raghu et al., 2017). Our results indicate that, given a sufficiently deep network, increasing the network width is important for the trainability of the model, and will lead to faster convergence rates. This is further supported by other recent research (Hanin, 2018; Hanin & Rolnick, 2018) that suggest that the width should increase linearly with depth in a neural network to help dynamics at the beginning of training. Our results also suggest the importance of further investigation into good initialization schemes for neural networks that make training very deep models possible (Zhang et al., 2019). Our results on the test set accuracies in appendix A further suggest that an interesting topic for future work would be to investigate the connection between gradient confusion and generalization (Fort et al., 2019).
