# ABSTRACT

We propose the Neural Program Lattice (NPL), a neural network which learns a hierarchical program structure based mostly on flat sequences of elementary operations. Compared to existing methods that can only learn from strong supervision such as full execution traces of programs, NPL learns with much weaker supervision and performs comparably well with the help of only a couple of full execution traces. We demonstrate the capability of our model to learn tasks like ADDITION and moving blocks in a grid-world. We show that by training mostly on unstructured operation sequences, NPL is able to extract the latent structures of sequences and learn to represent the program abstractions. Remarkably, NPL can achieve state-of-the-art performance with much weaker supervision than existing methods.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A critical component of learning to act in a changing and varied world is learning higher-level abstractions of sequences of elementary tasks. Without such abstractions we would be forced to reason at the level of individual muscle contractions, making everyday tasks such as getting ready for work and making dinner almost impossible. Instead, as humans, we learn a hierarchy of skills starting with basic limb movements and eventually getting to the level of tasks such as get ready for work or drive to the airport. These abstractions enable us to, for example, drive to a new location once we've learned how to drive to a few other locations. Such abstractions have many different names. In computer programming they are called functions or subroutines and in reinforcement learning they are called options or temporally extended actions.

The primary mechanism for learning is to observe others perform a task, and usually only a sequence of elementary operations (i.e., the most basic non-abstract actions we do) is observed. Pairing this with the generating abstractions (e.g., making coffee, filling the kettle, ...) has allowed Reed & de Freitas (2016) to train models with strong generalization, enabling, for example, the ability to add arbitrarily long numbers when trained only on relatively short numbers. More commonly, however, we only observe the elementary operations another person performed. We can see their limbs move, but we cannot see the abstractions which led to their elementary operations. For example we can capture users' click streams on an on-line application, or we can record their movements using a skeletal tracking depth camera (Microsoft Corp. Redmond WA). Existing techniques, however, cannot be applied on data like this because it does not contain the abstraction hierarchy.

We introduce NPL, a new framework for learning a hierarchical program structure based mostly on unstructured traces of elementary operations and associated environments. Similar to recent work on Neural Programmer-Interpreters (Reed & de Freitas, 2016), the core of NPL is an LSTM-based module that takes as input: (1) a learnable program (potentially with argument) embedding to execute and (2) an embedding of the current environment observation. Each module subsequently

generates an output flag indicating whether or not the current program should call a subprogram, perform an elementary operation or return control to its caller.

Our work focuses on the more realistic scenario where most of our data contains only sequences of elementary operations paired with environment observations, and we have access to just a couple of examples which include the full abstraction hierarchy. The main challenge arising in this scenario is that the standard LSTM training setup relies on a tight alignment between the inputs/outputs of the model and the input/outputs in the training data. However since the model can make arbitrarily many function calls and returns between each elementary operation in the training data, such an alignment cannot be generated.

We solve this problem by using a recurrent lattice of separate LSTM cell states, where each cell corresponds to a choice of both a location in the primitive operation sequence and a call stack depth. In this way any sequence of function calls and returns that generates the correct primitive operation sequence can be represented by some path through this lattice. We derive a fully differentiable objective function which maximizes the marginal probability of such paths, enabling training with standard backpropagation.

We demonstrate the capability of our model using the long-hand addition task from Reed & de Freitas (2016) and a newly-developed task involving a virtual agent building fences in a simple gridworld. We show that with only a couple training samples with full program traces but more with only elementary operation sequences, NPL is able to effectively infer the latent functional structure. Remarkably, NPL can achieve similar performance to NPI with much weaker supervision.

# 2 MODELBACKGROUND

In this section we give an overview of our model which is based directly on the neural programmer interpreter (NPI) Reed & de Freitas (2016) but differs in some of the details. NPI is an LSTM-based model which has been proposed and successfully applied to learn program representations and structures from full program traces (Reed & de Freitas, 2016). It learns the behavior of a library of programs which are allowed to call each other. Programs perform sequences of actions, controlled by the core NPI module, whose inputs are the current program (potentially with arguments) and environment observations. An action is either (1) calling a sub-program to execute; (2) performing an elementary operation<sup>1</sup> (e.g., write and output, move the pointer); or (3) returning to the caller. To support program calls and returns, the module contains a call stack. A program call pushes the current program state<sup>2</sup> to the call stack and starts a new module for the sub-program, and we refer to this action as PUSH. Its complement, POP, returns from a program by restarting the execution of its calling program using the information from the call stack, which is then removed. Finally, a STAY action allows the execution of an elementary operation, leaving the call stack unmodified. An overview of this process is displayed in Fig. 1.

Whenever we need to refer to a program, e.g., as input to the programmer module or when pushing onto and popping from the call stack, we will use a vector representation of it instead of its original discrete value. Thus we employ an embedding matrix  $E^{\mathcal{G}}$  to do this.

The concrete procedure for the programmer module to produce elementary operation sequences is as follows. We denote the (task-specific) environment observation as  $e^{t-1} \in \mathcal{E}$ , the program being executed as  $g^{t-1} \in \mathcal{G}$ , the call stack for program embeddings as  $S^{t-1}$  and that for LSTM hidden/cell states as  $M^{t-1}$ . We let  $S^{d,t-1}$  denote the program embedding stored at depth  $d$  of  $S^{t-1}$ . We let  $E^{\mathcal{G}}[g^{t-1}]$  denote the embedding for  $g^{t-1}$ . We employ a task-specific encoder  $f_{enc}: \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{G} \to \mathbb{R}^D$  and feed  $(e^{t-1}, E^{\mathcal{G}}[g^{t-1}])$  to get the encoding of current state  $u^t \in \mathbb{R}^D$ . Then we feed  $u^t$  through LSTM cells, the mapping of which we denote as  $f_{lstm}$ . Let  $h^{t-1}$  and  $c^{t-1}$  be the hidden states and cell states of  $f_{lstm}$ . By feeding  $u^t$  through  $f_{lstm}$  we get  $h^t$  and  $c^t$ . Finally, we decode  $h^t$  by applying three decoders:  $f_{stack}: \mathbb{R}^D \to \mathcal{P}^A = \mathcal{P}^{\{\text{PUSH,POP,STAY}\}}$ ,  $f_{prog}: \mathbb{R}^D \to \mathcal{P}^G$  and  $f_{op}: \mathbb{R}^D \to \mathcal{P}^O$ , where they decode  $h^t$  into probability distributions over program action space  $A$  (PUSH/POP/STAY), the program space  $G$  and the operation space  $O$ . Let  $a^t \in A$  be the program

action at time  $t$  in program traces. The feed-forward steps of program inference are summarized as follows:

# Encoding

$$
u ^ {t} = f _ {e n c} (e ^ {t - 1}, E ^ {\mathcal {G}} [ g ^ {t - 1} ]), \quad (h ^ {t}, c ^ {t}) = f _ {l s t m} (u ^ {t}, h ^ {t - 1}, c ^ {t - 1});
$$

# Decoding

$$
P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} = f _ {s t a c k} \left(h ^ {t}\right) \in \mathcal {P} ^ {\mathcal {A}}, \quad P ^ {\mathcal {G}, t} = f _ {p r o g} \left(h ^ {t}\right) \in \mathcal {P} ^ {\mathcal {G}}, \quad P ^ {\mathcal {O}, t} = f _ {o p} \left(h ^ {t}\right) \in \mathcal {P} ^ {\mathcal {O}};
$$

# Stack Update

$$
S ^ {d, t} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {P O P} \rrbracket S ^ {d + 1, t - 1} + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {S T A Y} \rrbracket S ^ {d, t - 1} + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {P U S H} \rrbracket E ^ {\mathcal {G}} [ g ^ {t - 1} ], & d = 1; \\ \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {P O P} \rrbracket S ^ {d + 1, t - 1} + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {S T A Y} \rrbracket S ^ {d, t - 1} + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {P U S H} \rrbracket S ^ {d - 1, t - 1}, & d > 1; \end{array} \right.
$$

$$
M ^ {d, t} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {P O P} \rrbracket M ^ {d + 1, t - 1} + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {S T A Y} \rrbracket M ^ {d, t - 1} + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {P U S H} \rrbracket (h ^ {t}, c ^ {t}), & d = 1; \\ \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {P O P} \rrbracket M ^ {d + 1, t - 1} + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {S T A Y} \rrbracket M ^ {d, t - 1} + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathsf {P U S H} \rrbracket M ^ {d - 1, t - 1}, & d > 1; \end{array} \right.
$$

If the module is given full program traces, training could be done by directly optimizing the log-probability of the module predicting the correct  $a^t \in \mathcal{A}$ ,  $g^t \in \mathcal{G}$  and  $o^t \in \mathcal{O}$  at each time step  $t$ . The objective then could be written as

$$
\mathcal {J} ^ {f u l l} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \log \mathcal {P} ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ a ^ {t} ] + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathrm {P U S H} \rrbracket \log \mathcal {P} ^ {\mathcal {G}, t} [ g ^ {t} ] + \llbracket a ^ {t} = \mathrm {S T A Y} \rrbracket \log \mathcal {P} ^ {\mathcal {O}, t} [ o ^ {t} ],
$$

where  $T$  is the length of program trace. However, as we have mentioned it may not be possible to get many samples with such rich supervision.

Clearly this objective is insufficient in the weakly supervised case, as it requires knowledge about the (latent) values of  $g^{t}$ . Moreover, when the NPI performs a PUSH or POP on the call stack, it does not perform a visible, elementary operation, and thus without knowing the values in  $g^{t}$  (and thus, the required PUSH and POP actions), matching timesteps to observed elementary actions is not straightforward. This is not a problem when doing inference since we can proceed greedily as choosing the program action with highest probability in  $P^{\mathcal{A},t}$  to proceed. However, when training only on operation sequences, the NPI cannot learn when and what to PUSH on or POP from the call stack due to the unstructured data and lack of supervision, neither does it know how deep its call stack is (which is an inherited problem since it confuses at whether to PUSH/POP). Such fact prevents the module from learning the latent representation and structure of the programs in an weakly supervised scenario.

# 3 NEURAL PROGRAM LATTICES

We now introduce an extension of the NPI model, together with a new objective function, that is able to learn from sequences of elementary actions, not requiring the strong supervision needed by the NPI.

# 3.1 PROBABILISTIC STACK AUGMENTATION

If only elementary operation sequences of programs are accessible, call stack updates cannot happen deterministically with the help of training signal in the forward pass of training. Recall that at each computation step, the LSTM controller module computes probability distributions over the next action, program and operation. Thus, we propose to manipulate the stack probabilistically, weighted by the distribution computed by  $P^{\mathcal{A},t}$ :

$$
S ^ {d, t} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {P O P} ] S ^ {d + 1, t - 1} + P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {S T A Y} ] S ^ {d, t - 1} + P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {P U S H} ] E ^ {\mathcal {G}, t - 1}, & d = 1; \\ P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {P O P} ] S ^ {d + 1, t - 1} + P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {S T A Y} ] S ^ {d, t - 1} + P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {P U S H} ] S ^ {d - 1, t - 1}, & d > 1; \end{array} \right.
$$

$$
M ^ {d, t} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathbb {P O P} ] M ^ {d + 1, t - 1} + P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {S T A Y} ] M ^ {d, t - 1} + P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathbb {P U S H} ] (h ^ {t}, c ^ {t}), & d = 1; \\ P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathbb {P O P} ] M ^ {d + 1, t - 1} + P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {S T A Y} ] M ^ {d, t - 1} + P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathbb {P U S H} ] M ^ {d - 1, t - 1}, & d > 1; \end{array} \right.
$$

Similarly, we set the vector representation of the predicted program at each time step as a weighted mixture of program embeddings, with weights corresponds to  $P^{\mathcal{G},t}$ :

$$
E ^ {\mathcal {G}, t} = \sum_ {g \in \mathcal {G}} P ^ {\mathcal {G}, t} [ g ] E ^ {\mathcal {G}} [ g ]
$$

We refer to the programmer module augmented with probabilistic stack as NPL module.

# 3.2 PROGRAM LATTICE MODULES

Using probabilistic stack manipulation, the NPL module is able to do the forward pass in training without the help of full program traces. However, there still remain ambiguities, specifically in the height of the call stack and the number of elementary operations performed so far.

More specifically, we choose limits  $I$  and  $L$  for the maximum length of the learned operation sequence and the maximal depth of the call stack. Then, there is a lattice of size  $(I + 1) \times (L + 1)$  representing the all possible program states, where a node  $(i,l)$  uniquely corresponds to a call stack depth  $l$  and position  $i$  in the operation sequence. If the next action is a PUSH, then the next corresponding node  $(i,l + 1)$  has call stack depth  $l + 1$  and is still at position  $i$ . Similarly, a POP leads to node  $(i,l - 1)$ , whereas a STAY (i.e., performing an operation) moves to the node  $(i + 1,l)$ . Every computation starts in node  $(0,0)$ , and ends in some  $(k,0)$ , where  $k$  is the number of operations

(a) Deterministic positions and transitions in lattice at each time step.

(b) Probabilistic positions and transitions in lattice at each time step.  
Figure 3: Locations and transitions of NPL module (denoted as the call stack) in the lattice. Within the lattice, horizontal positions indicate how many elementary operations have been done, vertical positions indicate how deep the current call stack is. When given full program traces (left), the module lies at one certain position in the lattice and move deterministically to another position; When given only operation sequences (right), the module lies at multiple possible positions and move probabilistically to other positions.

in the considered example. If a training examples contains all information, including PUSH/POP actions, we can uniquely determine the path through the lattice. Otherwise, we have a probability distribution indicating in which node of the lattice the program controller is for each time step.

To resolve such ambiguity, we assume that at each location in the lattice there lies one NPL module and in each time step we feed inputs to all of them. Since each of them comes with a probabilistic stack and will predict a distribution over  $\mathcal{A}$ ,  $\mathcal{G}$  and  $\mathcal{O}$ , we merge related probabilistic stacks by taking a weighted average of entries in stacks, where weights are related to the probabilities of the NPL module being in corresponding locations and being transited to the new location.

Concretely, we let  $i \in \{0, \dots, I\}$  denote the location in operation sequence,  $l \in \{0, \dots, L\}$  the depth of the call stack, and  $p_{i,l}^{*,t} \in \mathbb{R}$  where  $* \in \{\text{PUSH}, \text{POP}, \text{STAY}\}$  be the probabilities of transitioning from the module located at  $(i,l)$  in the lattice. Then we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} p _ {i, l} ^ {\mathrm {P U S H}, t} := P _ {i, l} ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {P U S H} ] (3.1) \\ p _ {i, l} ^ {\mathrm {P O P}, t} := P _ {i, l} ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \mathrm {P O P} ] (3.2) \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
p _ {i, l} ^ {\text {S T A Y}, t} := \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} P _ {i, l} ^ {\mathcal {A}, t} [ \text {S T A Y} ] P _ {i, l} ^ {\mathcal {O}, t} [ \mathrm {O P} _ {i + 1} ] & 0 \leq i \leq I - 1 \\ 0 & i = I \end{array} \right. \tag {3.3}
$$

where  $\mathsf{OP}_1, \ldots, \mathsf{OP}_I$  be the desired operation sequence of the program in consideration. We further construct  $y_{i,l}^{t}$  to be the probabilities of NPL module locating at position  $(i,l)$  in the lattice at  $t$ . Initially  $y_{0,0}^{0} = 1$ , which means the NPL module hasn't do any operation and its stack is empty (of depth 0) and all other  $y_{i,l}^{0}$  entries are 0's. The probability that at a new time step, the module locates at  $(i,l)$  is then given by

$$
y _ {i, l} ^ {t + 1} = \llbracket l <   L \rrbracket p _ {i, l + 1} ^ {\mathrm {P O P}, t} y _ {i, l + 1} ^ {t} + \llbracket 0 <   i \rrbracket p _ {i - 1, l} ^ {\mathrm {S T A Y}, t} y _ {i - 1, l} ^ {t} + \llbracket 0 <   l \rrbracket p _ {i, l - 1} ^ {\mathrm {P U S H}, t} y _ {i, l - 1} ^ {t} \tag {3.4}
$$

The conditions in Iverson brackets ensure that we don't push to an already full stack and don't pop from an already empty stack.

With these probabilities we are able to merge entries from different call stacks via their weighted summation and proceed the NPL module at each location of lattice as follows:

# Encoding

$$
u _ {i, l} ^ {t + 1} = f _ {e n c} (e ^ {i}, E _ {i, l} ^ {\mathcal {G}, t}), \quad (h _ {i, l} ^ {t + 1}, c _ {i, l} ^ {t + 1}) = f _ {l s t m} (u ^ {t}, H _ {i, l} ^ {t + 1}, C _ {i, l} ^ {t + 1});
$$

# Decoding

$$
P ^ {\mathcal {A}, t + 1} = f _ {s t a c k} (h ^ {t + 1}) \in \mathcal {P} ^ {\mathcal {A}}, P ^ {\mathcal {G}, t + 1} = f _ {p r o g} (h ^ {t + 1}) \in \mathcal {P} ^ {\mathcal {G}}, P ^ {\mathcal {O}, t + 1} = f _ {o p} (h ^ {t + 1}) \in \mathcal {P} ^ {\mathcal {O}};

Figure 4: Forward pass of NPL in training phase. Each frame (of lattice of call stacks) correspond to one time step. At time  $t$  we run modules at position  $(i,l)$  in the  $(I + 1)\times (L + 1)$  lattice with if  $y_{i,l}^{t} > 0$ , and do transitions probabilistically (PUSH/STAY/POP) by merging corresponding call stacks, hidden states and predicted mixed program embeddings. Note that in the graph we use blue arrows for PUSH transition, green for STAY and orange for POP. We only show partial transitions, other transitions follow the same way.

Figure 4 gives a visual illustration of the forwarding pass in training phase. At each time step, we run NPL module on each lattice position that has non-zero probabilities, do probabilistic transition based on prediction and merge corresponding stacks.

# 3.3 TRAINING OBJECTIVE

The objective is to maximize the probability of the NPL model correctly predicting all operations in the operation sequence and manipulate the stack properly. Recall that  $y_{i,l}^{t}$  is the probability of the NPL module having done  $i$  operations correctly and has stack of depth  $l$ . Thus, the probability of finishing all operations and returning properly at time  $t$  is given by  $p_{I,0}^{\mathrm{POP},t}y_{I,0}^{t}$ , namely the probability of NPL unit predicting POP when having finished  $I$  operations and call stack being empty. We maintain a summation of this quantity across all time steps as:

$$
y ^ {0} = 0, \quad y ^ {t + 1} = y ^ {t} + p _ {I, 0} ^ {\text {P O P}, t} y _ {I, 0} ^ {t}.
$$

Here  $y^{t}$  is essentially the marginal probability of model correctly finishing operation sequence and returning properly by time  $t$ . Consequently, the final objective to maximize is

$$
\mathcal {J} ^ {o p} = \log (y ^ {T})
$$

Remarks The set of parameters trained via optimizing  $\mathcal{I}^{full}$  and  $\mathcal{I}^{op}$  are same, thus NPL could be used to train simultaneously on samples with full program traces and those with elementary operation sequences, the latter of which can be much easier to get in practice. Later we will see that with training data having only a few full program traces we still obtain state-of-the-art with the help of samples with operation sequences.

# 3.4 NORMALIZATION

When the operation sequence is too long,  $y_{i,l}^{t}$  will become small quickly as  $i$  grows. To prevent the model from numerical underflow, instead of directly computing  $y_{i,l}^{t}$  we consider normalizing them and store the normalized values and normalization constant separately. The new update rule becomes:

$$
\bar {y} _ {i, l} ^ {t + 1} = \llbracket l <   L \rrbracket p _ {i, l + 1} ^ {\mathrm {P O P}, t} \hat {y} _ {i, l + 1} ^ {t} + \llbracket 0 <   i \rrbracket p _ {i - 1, l} ^ {\mathrm {S T A Y}, t} \hat {y} _ {i - 1, l} ^ {t} + \llbracket 0 <   l \rrbracket p _ {i, l - 1} ^ {\mathrm {P U S H}, t} \hat {y} _ {i, l - 1} ^ {t}, \tag {3.5}
$$

and we normalize the values and maintain a log-summation of the normalization constants

$$
Y ^ {t} = Y ^ {t - 1} + \log (\sum_ {i, l} \overline {{y}} _ {i, l} ^ {t}), \quad \hat {y} _ {i, l} ^ {t} = \overline {{y}} _ {i, l} ^ {t} / \sum_ {i, l} \overline {{y}} _ {i, l} ^ {t}.
$$

Then the original update for  $y^{t + 1}$  becomes

$$
\log (y ^ {t + 1}) = \log_ {-} \mathrm {s u m} _ {-} \exp (\log (y ^ {t}), \log (p _ {I, 0} ^ {\mathrm {P O P}, t}) + \log (\hat {y} _ {I, 0} ^ {t}) + Y ^ {t}),
$$

the computation of which can be done robustly.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we demonstrate the capability of NPL to learn the tasks of ADDITION and NANOCRAFT. We show that when dealing with these tasks, traditional sequence-to-sequence method fails in generalization even with large amount of training data, while existing methods like NPI that explicitly learn programs need strong supervision to give promising results. In contrast to these methods, NPL, with a fairly small amount of supervision, learns the latent structure of operation sequences and represents the program well. Remarkably, by learning from only a few training samples with full program traces but many ones with elementary operation sequences, NPL performs comparably well as the one that learns from samples that are all with full program traces and much better than sequence-to-sequence models.

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

As mentioned before, NPL can be used to train on samples with full program traces (referred to as FULL) and operation sequences (referred to as OP) jointly. When trained on FULL, it is similar to NPI in the sense that it learns to predict both programs and elementary operations simultaneously. We pick this setting of NPL as one of our baselines. For each of datasets on which we test NPL(), we only include a small number of FULL samples and all the others be OP. At each step we train with one batch of data purely from FULL with probability  $|FULL| / (|FULL| + |OP|)$  or OP with remaining probability and we optimize the corresponding objective in that step. We pre-train the model solely on FULL for some iterations to get a good initialization before the whole training procedure begins. For all tasks, we trained the NPL using the ADAM solver (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with base learning rate of  $10^{-4}$  and batch size of 1. We decay the learning rate by a factor of 0.95 every 10,000 iterations.

# 4.2 TASKS

NANOCRAFT In this task we consider an environment similar to those utilized in the reinforcement learning literature. The perceptual input comes from a 2-D grid world where each grid cell can be either empty or contain a block with both color and material attributes. The task is to move around the grid world and place blocks in the appropriate grid cells to form a rectangular fence. The fence must have a set of provided attributes: (1) color, (2) material, (3) location, and sizes in the

Figure 5: An illustrative example program for NANOCRAFT, where the agent (denoted as “*”) is required to build a rectangular red wooden fence at a certain location in a  $6 \times 6$  grid world. The agent (program) first makes several calls of MOVE MANY to move to the place and then call BUILD_FENCE four times to build fence in four cardinal directions. Note that there have been some pre-built fence where the person shouldn’t build anything.

Figure 6: An illustrative example program for ADDITION, where we are required to get result of adding 25 to 48. We have four pointers (denoted as “*”) for each row of the scratch pad. At the very beginning, all pointers are at the rightmost cells. We repeatedly call ADD1, which in turn calls ACT_WRITE to write the result, CARRY to take the carry digit and LSHIFT to shift all pointers left so as to work on next digits, until we hit the left most part of the scratch pad. The digit sequence on the fourth row of scratch pad is the result of addition.

(4) X and (5) Y dimensions. As shown in the example in Figure 5, at each step the agent can take one of two primitive actions, place a block at the current grid cell with a specific color and material, or move in one of the four cardinal directions. We explored both a fully observable setting, and a partially observable setting. In the fully observable setting, the world is presented as a stack of 3 grids, one indicating the material of the block at each location (or empty), a similar one for color and a final one-hot grid indicating the agent's location. In the partially observable setting, the agent is provided only two integers, indicating the color and material of the block (if any) at the current location. Finally, in both settings the world input state contains an auxiliary vector specifying the five attributes of the fence to be built. To ensure that the sequence of actions depends on the grid state, in each sample, a random subset of the necessary blocks have already been placed, and the agent must walk right over these locations with without placing a block.

Figure 7: Sample Complexity on NANOCRAFT: The x-axis varies the number of samples containing full program abstractions, while the y-axis shows the accuracy. NPL-{64,128,256} shows the accuracy of our model when trained with 64/128/256 training samples. NPL-Full shows the accuracy of NPI, which can utilize only the samples containing full program abstractions. Finally, Seq-{64,128,256} shows the accuracy of a seq2seq baseline when trained on 64/128/256 samples. It's performance does not change as we vary the number of samples with full program abstractions since it cannot utilize the additional supervision they provide.

ADDITION The task of ADDITION is to read in two numbers represented in digit sequences and compute the digit sequence of summation of these two numbers. The goal is to let the model learn the basic procedure of addition: Repeatedly adding two one-digit numbers, writing down result and carrying if necessary until we reach the very beginning of two digit sequences given. The whole procedure could be described as operating on a four-row scratch pad, where the first and second rows are input digit sequences, the third one is the carry digit and forth one the result. The environment observation is the numbers under four pointers, on on each row of scratch pad moving left and right. The pointers starts from the rightmost locations, and gradually move to the left most as the procedure goes. Figure 6 gives an example of full program traces as well as status of scratch pad at specific point.

# 4.3 SAMPLE COMPLEXITY

We assume that data with full programmatic abstractions is much more difficult to obtain than data containing only flat operation sequences, so we study the sample complexity in terms of the number of such samples. Figure 7 shows sample complexity for the NANOCRAFT task in the fully observable setting. We can see that for all training regimes with a small number of samples with full abstractions, NPL significantly outperforms the NPI baseline (NPL-Full). NPL similarly outperforms a seq2seq baseline (Seq-*) trained on all of the available data. We also performed preliminary experiments for the partially observable setting, and obtained similar results. All experiments were run with 10 different random seeds, and the best model was chosen using a separate validation set which is one-quarter the size of the training set.

# 4.4 GENERALIZATION ABILITY

A primary advantage of learning programmatic abstractions over sequences is an increased generalization capability. Figure 8 shows the generalization capabilities of our model on the ADDITION task. We train our model on samples with the number of input digits ranging from 1 to 5. The training data contains an equal number of samples for each digit, and includes full program abstractions for only one randomly chosen sample for each number of digits such that  $|FULL| = 5$ . We

Figure 8: Generalization performance on ADDITION: The x-axis varies the number of input digits for the samples in the test set, while the y-axis shows the accuracy. All models are trained on addition programs with inputs of 1 to 5 digits. NPL-X-Y shows the accuracy of our model when trained with  $X$  total samples (per number of digits), of which  $Y$  samples (per number of digits) include full program abstractions. Thus NPL-1-1 represents the performance of the NPI baseline. BiSeq-\{64,128\} shows the performance of the BiSeq baseline when trained with 64/128 samples per digit.

then test NPL using samples containing a much larger number of digits, ranging up to 1,000. We compare the performance of our model against three different models: (1) a sequence-to-sequence baseline specially designed for the addition task as described in the appendix of (Reed & de Freitas, 2016) (BiSeq-*), (2) the NPI baseline trained using only the single sample with full abstractions (NPL-1-1), and (3) a pair of oracle NPI models trained with full program abstractions for all samples (NPL-64-64 and NPL-128-128). For all settings, our model with "one-shot" strong supervision (NPL-*-1) significantly outperforms both baselines, and performs on par with the oracle NPL model which is provided much stronger supervision. As with NANOCRAFT, all experiments were run with 10 different random seeds, and the best model was chosen using a separate validation set which is one-quarter the size of the training set. However, for ADDITION the validation sets consisted entirely of 5-digit samples.

# 5 RELATED WORK

Many of the ideas in our approach have been studied extensively in past work. The most closely related work falls into four categories:

Reinforcement Learning Options Sutton et al. (1999) developed the options framework for building abstractions over elementary actions in a reinforcement learning setting. This framework bears many similarities ours. Specifically, at each time step the agent can choose either a one-step primitive action or a multi-step action policy called an option. As with our procedures, each option defines a policy over actions (either primitive or other options) and terminates according to some function. Much of the work on options has focused on the tabular setting where the set of possible states is small enough to consider them independently. More recent work has developed option discovery algorithms where the agent is encouraged to explore regions that were previously out of reach (Machado & Bowling, 2016) while other work has shown the benefits of manually chosen abstractions in large state spaces (Kulkarni et al., 2016). However, option discovery in large state spaces where non-linear state approximations are required is still an open problem, and our work can be viewed as a method for learning such options from expert trajectories.

Connectionist Temporal Classification Graves et al. (2006) introduced Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to enable the learning of RNNs for speech recognition from unsegmented training data. The training data for speech contains sequences of sound samples paired with a sequence of words often aligned only at the level of sentences. Training an RNN in this scenario runs into an alignment problem very similar to ours, where the exact alignment between individual sound samples and words must be treated as latent at training time. Although the speech problem is quite different from ours, they solve the underlying alignment problem using a very similar technique.

Neural Program Induction Much recent work has explored architectures for inducing a neural program given simply a set of input and output examples. (Graves et al., 2014) introduced Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) in this setting, and their encouraging results have inspired much follow-on work. Similar to NTMs, many of the proposed architectures have used differentiable memory (Kurach et al., 2016; Graves et al., 2016; Weston et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Neelakantan et al., 2016), while others have used the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992) to train neural networks that contain sampling based components in the memory (Andrychowicz & Kurach, 2016; Zaremba & Sutskever, 2015). While related to this work, our method is leverages stronger supervision in the form of elementary action sequences rather than just input-output examples. Such sequences are relatively easy to gather in many natural settings, and the additional supervision improves the data efficiency and allows our technique to scale to more complicated problems. Finally, there are many domains (e.g., learning to dance) where learning the correct sequence of actions is an important part of the task, further motivating this line of work.

Using Attention and Memory to Improve Learning with Sequence Data The most directly related past work augments RNNs with various attention and memory architectures in order to improve performance when training on sequence data. The original work in this area involved attentional processes in a sequence-to-sequence decoder which directly utilize a weighted version of the input during decoding, rather than forcing all relevant information from the input to be encoded into the hidden state (Bahdanau et al., 2015). More recently, Joulin & Mikolov (2015) considered augmenting an RNN with a differentiable stack, while Grefenstette et al. (2015) propose a similar architecture with deques which achieves more promising results. Our work distinguishes itself from this line of work in our use of explicit functional abstraction. The one exception to this is the NPI work which we have already discussed at length (Reed & de Freitas, 2016). Our main contribution on top of NPI is a training framework which mostly avoids the need for the functional abstractions to be included in the training data.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose NPL, a neural network with grid-structured modules that learns a hierarchical program structure based mostly on elementary operation sequences. The exact same model can be trained with different objective functions to handle samples with full program traces, further enhancing its flexibility and allowing us to train it simultaneously on two types of data. We test our model on the NANOCRAFT and ADDITION tasks and show that by training mostly on flat operation sequences, NPL is able to extract the latent structures of sequences and learn to represent the program well. Remarkably, NPL achieves state-of-the-art performances with much less supervision compared to existing models, making itself more applicable to real-world applications where full program traces are hard to get.
