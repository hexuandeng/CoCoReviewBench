# Abstract

Transformer-based object detectors have shown competitive performance recently. Compared with convolutional neural networks limited by the relatively small receptive fields, the advantage of transformer for visual tasks is the capacity to perceive long-range dependencies among all image patches, while the deficiency is that the local fine-grained information is not fully excavated. In this paper, we introduce the Fine-grained and Coarse-grained crossing representations for building an efficient Detection Transformer (FCDT). Specifically, we propose a local-global cross fusion module to establish the connection between local fine-grained features and global coarse-grained features. Besides, we propose a Fine-Coarse Aware Neck which enables det tokens to interact with both coarse-grained and fine-grained features. Furthermore, we present an efficient feature integration module to fuse multi-scale representations from different stages. Experimental results on Microsoft COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, our FCDT model achieves 48.1 AP with 173G FLOPs, which possesses higher accuracy and less computation compared with the state-of-the-art fully transformer-based detector ViDT.

# 1 Introduction

Object detection is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision. In the past decade, models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] used to be the mainstream architecture for object detection tasks [6, 7]. With the pioneering work of transformer [8] from natural language processing [9, 10] into object detection by DETR [11], its variants [12, 13, 14] show competitive detection performance [15], which can be attributed to the strong long-range dependency capturing ability.

Modern CNN-based object detectors, such as Faster-RCNN [16], YoloV3 [17], FCOS [18], and EfficientDet [19], can be divided into three parts: backbone, neck and head. With the development of transformer used for vision tasks, there are two common manners to deploy transformer for object detection. One is to replace the backbone with transformer variants in CNN-based object detectors. For example, some recently proposed transformer architectures like Swin Transformer [20], PVT [21, 22] and CMT [23] are utilized as backbone in the Mask-RCNN [24] or RetinaNet [25] detection frameworks. However, this manner heavily relies on the original detection frameworks, while anchor generation and post-processing with non-maximum suppression [26] are still indispensable. The role of transformer in this pattern is just backbone for feature extraction. The other manner is to replace the neck part with transformer [11], which can discard the post-processing and anchor setting in conventional detection framework. The typical representatives of this approach are DETR [11] and its variants, such as Deformable-DETR [12], Efficient DETR [13], and DAB-DETR [27].

Carion et al. propose DETR [11] to firstly combine CNN and transformer to build an end-to-end detector. In DETR, ResNet [2] is used as backbone for extracting features and transformer is proposed to integrate the relations between learnable object queries and extracted image features. However, DETR has two limitations. The first is the redundant computation brought by the encoder-decoder architecture of neck. The other is the slow convergence, which requires 500 epochs for training. Inspired by deformable convolution networks [28], Zhu et al. propose Deformable DETR [12], which replaces the original Multi-Head Attention Transformer with Deformable Attention Module. Besides, it aggregates multiscale features in different stages of backbone, which is effective for object detection. With this Multi-scale Deformable Attention Module, Deformable DETR greatly exceeds

DETR in both accuracy and training speed. To fully dig the potential of transformer in object detection, Song et al. construct an efficient and effective fully transformer-based (both backbone and neck are transformer-based architectures) object detector called ViDT [14]. It adopts Swin-Transformer [20] as backbone and reconfigures the attention module to support standalone object detection. In addition, it incorporates an encoder-free neck structure to boost the detection performance without much increase in computational load. ViDT obtains the best AP and latency trade-off among existing transformer-based object detectors. Furthermore, some recently proposed transformer-based object detectors [29, 30, 31, 32] show better performance than original CNN-based detectors.

For transformer-based detection models like DETR [11] and ViDT[14], the typical strategy is to perform long-range attention on the divided feature patches. Compared with convolutional neural networks limited by small receptive field scale, the advantage of transformer-based models is the capacity to perceive long-range dependencies among all image patches. However, these models ignore the spatial local information within each patch. There are more useful fine-grained features inside each divided patch, which are rarely considered. Considering the general object detection task[6], there are objects of various sizes. The fine-grained features can help to recognize multi-scale and irregular objects. For the previous transformer-based detectors, excessive pursuit of global feature representations yet paying less attention to local representations limits them for multi-scale perception. Therefore, it is crucial for object detectors to capture and fuse both fine-grained features inside the image patches and the global coarse-grained features to better detect objects with different scales.

In this paper, we propose to fully leverage both local Fine-grained and global Coarse-grained features to build an efficient Detection Transformer (FCDT) for object detection, which is a fully transformer-based detector with transformer backbone and transformer neck. In the backbone, we maintain both fine-grained and coarse-grained features and introduce a lightweight Local-Global Cross Fusion (LGCF) module. In this way, a fully bidirectional cross fusion between local fine-grained and global coarse-grained informations is carried out in each stage. In terms of neck, we propose Fine-Coarse Aware Neck (FCAN) which allows detection tokens to make attention-based interaction with fine-grained representations firstly, and then perform further interaction with coarse-grained representations. Finally, we design a lightweight bottom-up feature integration algorithm called Efficient Multiscale Feature Intergration (EMFI) to enrich high resolution feature maps in the early stages. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. As shown in Fig. 1, our FCDT detectors obtain the best AP and FLOPs trade-off among existing transformer-based object detectors.

# 2 Preliminaries

In this section, we briefly revisit the fine-grained representations in transformer and detection transformer frameworks.

# 2.1 Fine-grained Representations in Transformer

Transformer-based models are effective in visual tasks because they divide the original images into  $N$  patches and capture long-range dependencies between these  $N$  patches [33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. However, such a framework destroys the internal relationship and ignores the fine-grained representations inside each patch. Han et al. [38] propose Transformer iN Transformer (TNT) that not only constructs the global connection among outer patches, but also the inner attention mechanism of each patch. The outer patches describe global coarse-grained features while the inner patches represent local fine-grained information. We use  $\mathcal{F}_O^{l-1}$  and  $\mathcal{F}_I^{l-1}$  to represent outer patches and inner patches input to the  $l$  stage, and the outputs correspond to  $\mathcal{F}_O^l$  and  $\mathcal{F}_I^l$ . So the basic TNT block can be written as follows:

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l} = \mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l - 1} + M L P \left(L N \left(\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l - 1} + M S A \left(L N \left(\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l - 1}\right)\right)\right)\right) \tag {1}
$$

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l} = \mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l - 1} + M L P (L N (\mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l - 1} + M S A (L N (\mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l - 1} + F C (\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l})))) \tag {2}
$$

Eq. 1 is inner transformer and Eq. 2 is outer transformer with inner attention. In the above equations,  $MLP$ ,  $LN$  and  $MSA$  respectively represent Multi-Layer Perceptron, Layer Normalization [39] and Multi-head Self-Attention.  $FC$  is the linear projection layer. With TNT block, each outer patch can not only obtain the long-range dependency with other outer patches, but also integrate its corresponding finer-grained inner representations.

PyramidTNT [40] is the improvement model on TNT, which introduces pyramid architecture and convolutional stem. With the relatively small amount of computation, PyramidTNT achieves higher accuracy in ImageNet benchmark [41]. Besides, the pyramid architecture is more suitable as the backbone of object detection and instance segmentation. With PyramidTNT as backbone, we obtain multi-scale inner fine-grained features and outer coarse-grained features.

# 2.2 Detection Transformer

DETR. DETR utilizes ResNet as backbone to extract features. In the neck part, it uses  $6 \times$  transformer blocks for features self-attention, and uses  $6 \times$  transformer blocks to perform cross attention between object queries and feature memory. After transformer-based neck, the final classification and regression results are predicted directly through MLP detection head. For training sample selection, DETR constructs the matching cost matrix object queries and ground truths, and uses Hungarian algorithm to efficiently calculate the optimal assignment [42]. This detector is an end-to-end framework, which does not build anchor boxes and non-maximum suppression.

Deformable DETR. There are still two deficiencies for DETR, including slow convergence and relatively poor detection performance for small objects. Deformable DETR utilizes Deformable Attention module, which attends to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Besides, the Deformable Attention module can be naturally extended to aggregate multi-scale features, which is effective for object detection. Compared with DETR, Deformable DETR only needs 50 epochs to converge and greatly improve the detection performance of small objects.

ViDT. Compared with DETR or Deformable DETR, ViDT is a fully transformer-based detector. For the backbone, ViDT employs Swin-Transformer rather than ResNet. To fully utilize the transformer-based backbone, det tokens and patches share the same attention weights. In the last stage, ViDT constructs reconfigured attention module to make cross attention between det tokens and patches. As for neck, ViDT only maintains the decoder part of Deformable DETR and its structure is computationally efficient. Compared with DETR series frameworks and other transformer-based detectors, ViDT obtains the best AP and latency trade-off.

# 3 Approach

In this section, we describe the proposed modules in detail. Firstly, we present the Local-Global Cross Fusion module to improve the backbone for object detection. Then, we illustrate the Fine-Coarse Aware Neck to further make det tokens interact with inner and outer patches. Finally, we introduce the lightweight bottom-up feature integration algorithm Efficient Multi-scale Feature Integration module.

# 3.1 Local-Global Cross Fusion

![](images/a35464b7b5fc9dcb614fd4bba653d0ae762d91d24640dc16ed98b16390fca8ff.jpg)  
Figure 2: Illustration of LGCF embedded in the backbone of PyramidTNT in FCDT. Patch Aggr represents patches aggregation, which is used to merge and reduce patches. Down-Trans. and Up-Trans. respectively indicate spatial down-transform and up-transform of patches.

Although the outer patches can acquire fine-grained inner representations from TNT blocks (as well PyramidTNT blocks), the restricted receptive field of inner patches and the unidirectional "Inner to Outer" strategy limit the performance of inner features. Besides, the inner patches corresponding to each outer patch can only make self-attention in a fixed  $4 \times 4$  region. As a result, they have no connection with inner patches that belong to other outer patches. We propose an effective module called Local-Global Cross Fusion (LGCF), as shown in Fig. 2. LGCF is divided into two sub-modules, including Local Cross Fusion (LCF) and Global Cross Fusion (GCF).

Given a 2D image  $\mathcal{I} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$ , we use  $\mathcal{F}_O^l \in \mathbb{R}^{\frac{H}{2l + 2} \times \frac{W}{2l + 2} \times C_l}$  and  $\mathcal{F}_I^l \in \mathbb{R}^{\frac{H}{2l} \times \frac{W}{2l} \times \frac{C_l}{16}}$  to represent outer coarse-grained patches and inner fine-grained patches output by the  $l$  stage, respectively.

For inner patches, we propose LCF to fuse them with long-range dependency to expand receptive field. Since the relationship between outer patches is global, LCF brings the perception of global information to the original inner patches which only attach fixed  $4 \times 4$  internal self-attention. The LCF can be illustrated as following equations:

$$
C r o s s _ {I} ^ {l} = \mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l} + U p s a m p l e \left(\operatorname {C o n v} _ {1 \times 1} \left(\mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l}\right)\right)) \tag {3}
$$

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l} = \mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l} + G E L U (L N (\operatorname {C o n v} _ {3 \times 3} (\operatorname {C r o s s} _ {I} ^ {l}))) \tag {4}
$$

Eq. 3 describes the cross operation from outer to inner. In the equation,  $Conv_{1\times 1}$  and Upsample represent convolution with kernel size  $1\times 1$  and upsampling with bilinear interpolation respectively. We use point convolution to keep the number of feature maps of outer patches consistent with inner patches, and expand its spatial scale to 16 times through upsampling. The transformed outer patches are in line with inner patches both in spatial dimension and channel dimension.  $Cross_{I}^{l}$  is the summation of inner patches and transformed outer patches. Then, we use the combination

of "Convolution-Normalization-Activation" to further fuse the crossed features, as shown in Eq. 4.  $Conv_{3 \times 3}$  is the convolution with  $3 \times 3$  kernel size. We use  $LN$  and  $GELU$  to represent Layer Normalization [39] and Gaussian Error Linear Unit activation [43].

Although the outer patches acquire fine-grained inner representations with original PyramidTNT block, the fusion method of simple flattening and addition ignores spatial information. Similar to LCF, we propose GCF to integrate inner features into outer patches in the feature map dimension. This process can be described as follows:

$$
C r o s s _ {O} ^ {l} = \mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l} + C o n v _ {4 \times 4} \left(\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l}\right) \tag {5}
$$

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l} = \mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l} + G E L U (L N (\operatorname {C o n v} _ {3 \times 3} (C r o s s _ {O} ^ {l}))) \tag {6}
$$

Eq. 5 represents the cross from operation inner patches to outer patches. Different from the combination of point convolution and upsample in Eq. 3, we directly use a  $Conv_{4 \times 4}$  to make transformed  $\mathcal{F}_I^l$  consistent with  $\mathcal{F}_Q^l$  both in spatial shape and feature channel. In Eq. 6, we also use the combination of "Convolution-Normalization-Activation" to further fuse the crossed features.

With this module, bidirectional cross fusion is carried out between local features and global features after each stage. The local representations integrate more global information and the original global coarse-grained representations fuse the fine-grained information. Experimental results show that the LGCF greatly improves the performance of object detector.

# 3.2 Fine-Coarse Aware Neck

![](images/d6e274ca2b67d8fa627965c894a32c6966a6da1badbf92376dd32a2c2975b2b8.jpg)  
Figure 3: Illustration of Fine-Coarse Aware Neck Structure in FCDT. MSDA is the abbreviation of Multi-Scale Deformable Attention. The small brown star indicates sampling point.

No matter DETR or ViDT, the neck part is always cross attention between det tokens and global long-range dependency features. In terms of object detection, there are usually targets with different scales in different positions. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to multi-scale and multi-source useful features. We propose Fine-Coarse Aware Neck (FCAN), which allows det tokens to interact with not only coarse-grained outer patches but also with fine-grained inner patches. We perform Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) [12] between det tokens and local fine-grained features firstly, then is the further attention mechanism between det tokens and global coarse-grained features, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The cross attention between det tokens and inner patches can be described as follows:

$$
M S D A \left(Q _ {d e t}, \left\{\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l} \right\} _ {l = 1} ^ {L}\right) = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M _ {I}} W _ {m} \left[ \sum_ {l = 1} ^ {L} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K _ {I}} A _ {m l k} \cdot W _ {m} ^ {\prime} \mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l} \left(\phi_ {l} (p) + \Delta p _ {m l k}\right) \right] \tag {7}
$$

$$
Q _ {d e t} = Q _ {d e t} + M S D A \left(Q _ {d e t}, \left\{\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l} \right\} _ {l = 1} ^ {L}\right) \tag {8}
$$

In the above equations, we use  $Q_{det}$  to represent det tokens. Eq. 7 is the Multi-Scale Deformable Attention between det tokens and inner patches.  $M_I$  indices the attention head and  $K_I$  is the total number of sampled keys in inner patches. Besides, we use  $\phi_l(p)$  to represent the reference point in the  $l$  stage feature, while  $\Delta p_{mk}$  is the corresponding sampling offset for deformable attention; and  $A_{mk}$  is the attention weights of the  $K$  sampled contents.  $W_m$  and  $W_m'$  are the projection matrices

for multi-head attention. After the deformable cross attention of det tokens and inner patches, we combine the  $MSDA(Q_{det},\{\mathcal{F}_I^l\}_{l = 1}^L)$  to  $Q_{det}$  and interact with  $\mathcal{F}_O$ . This process is as follows:

$$
M S D A \left(Q _ {d e t}, \left\{\mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l} \right\} _ {l = 1} ^ {L}\right) = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M _ {O}} W _ {m} \left[ \sum_ {l = 1} ^ {L} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K _ {O}} A _ {m l k} \cdot W _ {m} ^ {\prime} \mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l} \left(\phi_ {l} (p) + \Delta p _ {m l k}\right) \right] \tag {9}
$$

where  $M_O$  indices the attention head and  $K_O$  is the total number of sampled keys in outer patches. Consistent with the original MSDA in Deformable DETR [12], we set the default values of  $M_I$  and  $M_O$  to 8.

# 3.3 Efficient Multi-scale Feature Integration

For a 2D image  $\mathcal{I} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$ , the output spatial shapes of four stages in our method are set as  $\frac{H}{8} \times \frac{W}{8}$ ,  $\frac{H}{16} \times \frac{W}{16}$ ,  $\frac{H}{32} \times \frac{W}{32}$ ,  $\frac{H}{64} \times \frac{W}{64}$ . In contrast, the outputs spatial shapes of Swin-Transformer or ResNet are set as  $\frac{H}{4} \times \frac{W}{4}$ ,  $\frac{H}{8} \times \frac{W}{8}$ ,  $\frac{H}{16} \times \frac{W}{16}$ ,  $\frac{H}{32} \times \frac{W}{32}$ . Utilizing Swin-Transformer or ResNet as backbone in ViDT or Deformable DETR, output of the first stage is not used by the neck because of the insufficient feature extraction ability, and downsampling the features of the last stage are set as an additional feature maps. Therefore, the final output spatial shapes are set as  $\frac{H}{8} \times \frac{W}{8}$ ,

![](images/52a2de8896e22375289d8370fc30d0effa50eecda6b0277e114167cb9b1f7401.jpg)

$\frac{H}{16} \times \frac{W}{16}$ ,  $\frac{H}{32} \times \frac{W}{32}$ ,  $\frac{H}{64} \times \frac{W}{64}$ . In object detection, the scale of feature maps has a great impact on detection performance. It is more effective to use large-scale feature maps for small object detection. Therefore, although the feature extraction capability of the first stage is limited, we still cannot ignore the output features of this stage.

To utilize the output of the first stage, we design an Efficient Multiscale Feature Integration (EMFI) to enhance the feature richness of the early stages, as shown in Fig. 4. In order not to increase too much calculation, EMFI is extremely lightweight. We insert this module into inner fine-grained and outer coarse-grained respectively. This module can be described as follows:

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l} = \mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l} + U p s a m p l e \left(\operatorname {C o n v} _ {1 \times 1} \left(\mathcal {F} _ {O} ^ {l + 1}\right)\right) \tag {10}
$$

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l} = \mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l} + U p s a m p l e \left(\operatorname {C o n v} _ {1 \times 1} \left(\mathcal {F} _ {I} ^ {l + 1}\right)\right) \tag {11}
$$

The  $l$  stage output is the summation of original features and transformed  $l + 1$  stage output. The transformed operation is consist of bilinear interpolation and point convolution, which bring less computational cost. Such a bottom-up structure enables the high-resolution feature maps of the early stages to integrate the later features with low resolution but stronger semantic ability.

# 4 Experiments

In this section, we show the great performance with FCDT through the comparison of experimental results. We also illustrate the ablation study about LGCF and sampling points of FCAN. Finally, we provide a complete analysis of all components in our method.

# 4.1 Dataset and Implementation Details

We conduct experiments on Microsoft COCO 2017 benchmark [6]. Following the usual practice, we utilize 118K training images to train object detectors and perform test experiments under 5K validation images.

We follow the training strategy provided in ViDT [14], including AdamW [44] with the initial learning rate of  $1 \times 10^{-4}$ , training with multi-scale input sizes and total training epoch is set as 50, etc. All the experiments are conducted in PyTorch [45] 1.8 deep learning framework and  $8 \times$  NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs. We use PyramidTNT series models pretrained on ImageNet-1K as initial backbones of detectors. The results are reported over three backbones: PyramidTNT-Tiny (P-Tiny), PyramidTNT-Small (P-Small), and PyramidTNT-Medium (P-Medium). Considering the existence of Batch Normalization [46] in the Stem of backbone and the batch size of training object detection network is much smaller than that in image classification, we freeze all parameters of Batch Normalization layers in the training process. Besides, the training batch size per GPU of P-Tiny and P-Small is set as 2, while that of P-Medium is 1.

For evaluation, we follow the definition of Average Precision (AP) in COCO. Due to the difference of computing power in various hardware devices, we show floating point operations (FLOPs) to reflect the inference speed of our models. During the test, the shortest side is set as 800 pixels while the longest side is at most 1333 pixels.

*FT is the abbreviation of Fully Transformer-based.

We compare our method with latest Transformer based detectors, including DETR[11], SMCA[52], UP DETR[49], Efficient DETR[13], Conditional DETR[48], DAB DETR[27], DN DETR[50], SAM DETR[51], YOLOS[47] and ViDT[14], as shown in Tab. 1. The proposed FCDT shows great performance both in accuracy and computation. With the lightweight P-Tiny as backbone, our method achieves 43.0 AP with only 33G FLOPs. The comparison lightweight model is ViDT based on Swin-Nano, which reaches 40.4 AP with 37G FLOPs. Our method not only obviously surpasses ViDT with Swin-Nano in AP, but also needs less computation cost. While for P-Small, our method achieves 45.8 AP with 77G FLOPs. This model still exceeds the corresponding ViDT with Swin-Tiny 1.0 AP, and the amount of calculation is significantly reduced by 37G FLOPs. For the largest model with P-Medium, our method achieves 48.1 AP with 173G FLOPs. In terms of AP, the detectors close to our method are DN DETR with DC5-ResNet-101 and ViDT with Swin-Small. Compared with them, the computational complexity of our method is lower than these detectors 109G FLOPs and 35G FLOPs respectively. Besides, our method still reaches a better detection accuracy than theirs.

In addition, compared with those detectors with ResNet as backbone, fully transformer-based models like ViDT and FCDT show better performance (higher AP and less FLOPs). This also reveals that fully transformer-based frameworks possess great potential for efficient object detection. Our proposed FCDT obtains the best trade-off between AP and FLOPs among other detectors.

# 4.3 Ablations

Comparison between PyramidTNT and Swin-Transformer. In order to illustrate that our detection performance is not due to the backbone replacement of PyramidTNT, we firstly show the comparison of PyramidTNT and Swin-Transformer in Tab. 2. Although the Top-1 accuracy of PyramidTNT series on ImageNet is slightly higher than that of the corresponding sized Swin-Transformer models, AP of directly taking PyramidTNT-Small or PyramidTNT-Medium as backbone of ViDT is significantly lower than that of Swin-Transformer. For further analysis, compared with PyramidTNT, Swin

Transformer utilizes the "Shift Window" to obtain multi-scale features, which is effective for object detection. So for fully transformer-based object detection, it is not good enough to directly deploy PyramidTNT as backbone. This also reflects that our proposed method is more suitable for object detection task, which greatly improves the accuracy of detectors.

Local-Global Cross Fusion. We analyze the impact of different elements in LGCF, as shown in Tab. 3. The baseline of our method with backbone of P-Tiny is 40.8 AP. After introducing the LCF to fuse the outer coarse-grained patches into fine-grained inner patches, AP is improved to 41.3. Correspondingly, it is more effective to embed GCF in the detector. After the introduction of GCF, we achieve an AP improvement of 1.2 compared with baseline. For further analysis, the improvement of GCF is higher than LCF, but it is also accompanied by a higher amount of calculation. The reason is that the channels of outer patches are 16 times that of inner. So the convolution operation in GCF brings more computation. Finally, we combine the two cross fusion strategies together and achieve an improvement of 1.4 AP compared with baseline.

$\star$  AP is obtained by taking ViDT as detection framework and the corresponding models set as backbone.

Sampling Points of FCAN. We conduct an ablation experiment on the sampled points number  $K_{I}$  of inner fine-grained patches. The baseline is the P-Tiny backbone with LGCF whose AP is 42.2. For outer patches, we set  $K_{O}$  as 4, which is consistent with Deformable DETR and ViDT. Considering that one outer patch corresponds to 16 inner patches, so  $K_{I}$  is set to an integer multiple of 16. The result is as shown in Tab. 4. When  $K_{I}$  is set to 0, there is no cross attention between det tokens and fine-grained patches in the neck part. At this time, det tokens directly interact with outer global coarse-grained patches through Multi-Scale Deformable Cross Attention modules. When  $K_{I}$  equals to 32, AP increases to 42.3 with det tokens interacting with 32 sampled keys of inner patches. The best performance is  $K_{I}$  set to 64, which obtains 42.6 AP and 0.4 higher than baseline. At this time,  $K_{I}$  equals 64 inner points that 4 sampled outer keys correspond to.

Complete Component Analysis. We analyze all components in FCDT, and the detailed result is as shown in Tab. 5. For Tiny model as backbone, we find that the LGCF, FCAN and EMFI improve the AP of 1.4, 0.4, 0.4 respectively. Combining the optimization strategies, our method achieve 43.0 AP, which is 2.2 AP higher than baseline. In addition, the increase of computation brought by the introduction of these three modules is reasonable. Compared with ViDT based on Swin-Nano (40.4 AP, 37G FLOPs), our method has less computation, but possesses 2.6 AP higher than Swin-Nano. For other backbones of our method, although the proposed modules add a little computation on the baseline, the FLOPs of FCDT is still less than that of other models. Compared with other transformer-based detectors, our method achieve a better AP.

# 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose an efficient object detector called FCDT with Fine-grained and Coarse-grained cross representations. In order to further improve the performance of detector, we propose Local-Global Cross Fusion Module, Fine-Coarse Aware Neck and Efficient Multi-scale Feature Intergration. Compared with the state-of-the-art fully transformer-based detector ViDT, the combination of our approach achieves better detection performance with less computation. Among other transformer-based detectors, our method obtains the best AP and FLOPs trade-off. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FCDT. For future research, we hope to transfer this idea to more transformer-based models, so as to improve the performance of various visual tasks with transformer.
