# ABSTRACT

Deep neural networks based on unfolding an iterative algorithm, for example, LISTA (learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm), have been an empirical success for sparse signal recovery. The weights of these neural networks are currently determined by data-driven "black-box" training. In this work, we propose Analytic LISTA (ALISTA), where the weight matrix in LISTA is computed as the solution to a data-free optimization problem, leaving only the step-size and threshold parameters to data-driven learning. This significantly simplifies the training. Specifically, the data-free optimization problem is based on coherence minimization. We show our ALISTA retains the optimal linear convergence proved in (Chen et al., 2018) and has a performance comparable to LISTA. Furthermore, we extend ALISTA to convolutional linear operators, again determined in a data-free manner. We also propose a feed-forward framework that combines the data-free optimization and ALISTA networks from end to end, one that can be jointly trained to gain robustness to small perturbations in the encoding model.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Sparse vector recovery, or sparse coding, is a classical problem in source coding, signal reconstruction, pattern recognition and feature selection. There is an unknown sparse vector  $\mathbf{x}^{*} = [x_{1}^{*},\dots ,x_{M}^{*}]^{T}\in \mathbb{R}^{M}$ . We observe it noisy linear measurements:

$$
\mathbf {b} = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \mathbf {d} _ {m} x _ {m} ^ {*} + \varepsilon = \mathbf {D} \mathbf {x} ^ {*} + \varepsilon , \tag {1}
$$

where  $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ ,  $\mathbf{D} = [\mathbf{d}_1, \dots, \mathbf{d}_M] \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times M}$  is the dictionary, and  $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}^N$  is additive Gaussian white noise. For simplicity, each column of  $\mathbf{D}$ , named as a dictionary kernel, is normalized, that is,  $\| \mathbf{d}_m \|_2 = \| \mathbf{D}_{:,m} \|_2 = 1$ ,  $m = 1, 2, \dots, M$ . Typically, we have  $N \ll M$ , so Equation (1) is an under-determined system.

However, when  $\mathbf{x}^*$  is sufficiently sparse, it can be recovered faithfully. A popular approach is to solve the LASSO problem below (where  $\lambda$  is a scalar):

$$
\underset {\mathbf {x}} {\operatorname {m i n i m i z e}} \frac {1}{2} \| \mathbf {b} - \mathbf {D x} \| _ {2} ^ {2} + \lambda \| \mathbf {x} \| _ {1} \tag {2}
$$

using iterative algorithms such as the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA):

$$
\mathbf {x} ^ {(k + 1)} = \eta_ {\lambda / L} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} + \frac {1}{L} \mathbf {D} ^ {T} (\mathbf {b} - \mathbf {D} \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)})\right), \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots \tag {3}
$$

where  $\eta_{\theta}$  is the soft-thresholding function and  $L$  is usually taken as the largest eigenvalue of  $\mathbf{D}^T\mathbf{D}$ .

Inspired by ISTA, the authors of (Gregor & LeCun, 2010) proposed to learn the weights in the matrices in ISTA rather than fixing them. Their methods is called Learned ISTA (LISTA) and resembles a recurrent neural network (RNN). If the iteration is truncated to  $K$  iterations, LISTA becomes a  $K$ -layer feed-forward neural network with side connections. Specifically, LISTA is:

$$
\mathbf {x} ^ {(k + 1)} = \eta_ {\theta^ {(k)}} \left(\mathbf {W} _ {1} ^ {(k)} \mathbf {b} + \mathbf {W} _ {2} ^ {(k)} \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)}\right), \quad k = 0, 1, \dots , K - 1. \tag {4}
$$

If we set  $\mathbf{W}_1^{(k)} \equiv \frac{1}{L}\mathbf{D}^T$ ,  $\mathbf{W}_2^{(k)} \equiv \mathbf{I} - \frac{1}{L}\mathbf{D}^T\mathbf{D}$ ,  $\theta^{(k)} \equiv \frac{1}{L}\lambda$ , then LISTA recovers ISTA. Given each pair of sparse vector and its noisy measurements  $(\mathbf{x}^*,\mathbf{b})$ , applying (4) from some initial point  $\mathbf{x}^{(0)}$  and using  $\mathbf{b}$  as the input yields  $\mathbf{x}^{(k)}$ . Our goal is to choose the parameters  $\Theta = \{\mathbf{W}_1^{(k)},\mathbf{W}_w^{(k)},\theta^{(k)}\}_{k = 0,1,\dots,K - 1}$  such that  $\mathbf{x}^{(k)}$  is close to  $\mathbf{x}^*$  for all sparse  $\mathbf{x}^*$  following some distribution  $\mathcal{P}$ . Therefore, given the distribution  $\mathcal{P}$ , all parameters in  $\Theta$  are subject to learning:

$$
\underset {\Theta} {\operatorname {m i n i m i z e}} \mathbb {E} _ {\mathbf {x} ^ {*}, \mathbf {b} \sim \mathcal {P}} \left\| \mathbf {x} ^ {(K)} \left(\Theta , \mathbf {b}, \mathbf {x} ^ {(0)}\right) - \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \right\| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {5}
$$

This problem is approximately solved over a training dataset  $\{(\mathbf{x}_i^*,\mathbf{b}_i)\}_{i = 1}^N$  sampled from  $\mathcal{P}$ .

Many empirical results, e.g., (Gregor & LeCun, 2010; Sprechmann et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016), show that a trained  $K$ -layer LISTA (with  $K$  usually set to  $10 \sim 20$ ) or its variants can generalize more than well to unseen samples  $(\mathbf{x}', \mathbf{b}')$  from the same distribution and recover  $\mathbf{x}'$  from  $\mathbf{b}'$  to the same accuracy within one or two order-of-magnitude fewer iterations than the original ISTA. Additionally, the accuracies of the outputs  $\{\mathbf{x}^{(k)}\}$  of the layers  $k = 1, \dots, K$  gradually improve. However, such networks will generalize worse when the input deviates from the training distribution (e.g., when  $\mathbf{D}$  varies), in contrast to the classical iterative algorithms such as ISTA that are training-free and thus agnostic to the input distribution.

More recently, the convolutional sparse coding (CSC), an extension of the sparse coding (1), gains increasingly attention in the machine learning area. (Sreter & Giryes, 2018) showed that the CSC could be similarly approximated and accelerated by a LISTA-type feed-forward network. (Tolooshams et al., 2018) designed a structure of sparse auto-encoder inspired by multi-layer CSC. (Papyan et al., 2016; Sulam et al., 2017) also revealed CSC as a potentially useful tool for understanding general convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

# 1.1 RELATED WORK

Despite the empirical success (Sprechmann et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Zhang & Ghanem, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Ito et al., 2018) in constructing fast trainable regressors for approximating iterative sparse optimization solvers, the theoretical understanding of such approximations remains limited.

A handful of recent works have been investigating the theory of LISTA. (Moreau & Bruna, 2017) re-factorized the Gram matrix of dictionary, by trying to nearly diagonalize the Gram matrix with a basis, subject to a small  $\ell_1$  perturbation. They thus re-parameterized LISTA a new factorized architecture that achieved similar acceleration gain to LISTA, hence ending up with an "indirect" proof. They concluded that LISTA can converge faster than ISTA, but still sublinearly. (Giryes et al., 2018) interpreted LISTA as a projected gradient descent descent (PGD) where the projection step was inaccurate, which enables a trade-off between approximation error and convergence speed. The latest work (Chen et al., 2018) presented the more related results to ours: they introduced necessary conditions for the LISTA weight structure in order to achieve asymptotic linear convergence of LISTA, which also proved to be a theoretical convergence rate upper bound. They also introduced a thresholding scheme for practically improving the convergence speed. Note that, none of the above works extended their discussions to CSC and its similar LISTA-type architectures.

Several other works examined the theoretical properties of some sibling architectures to LISTA. (Xin et al., 2016) studied the model proposed by (Wang et al., 2016), which unfolded/truncated the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm instead of ISTA, for approximating the solution to  $\ell_0$ -minimization. They showed that the learnable fast regressor can obtain a transformed dictionary with improved restricted isometry property (RIP). However, their discussions are not applicable to LISTA directly, although IHT is linearly convergent (Blumensath & Davies, 2009) under rather strong assumptions. Their discussions were also limited to linear sparse coding and resulting fully-connected networks only. (Borgerding et al., 2017; Metzler et al., 2017) studied a similar learning-based model inspired from another LASSO solver, called approximated message passing (AMP). (Borgerding et al., 2017) showed the MMSE-optimality of an AMP-inspired model, but not accompanied with any convergence rate result. Also, the popular assumption in analyzing AMP algorithms (called "state evolution") does not hold when analyzing ISTA.

# 1.2 MOTIVATION AND CONTRIBUTIONS

This paper presents multi-fold contributions in advancing the theoretical understanding of LISTA, beyond state-of-the-art results. Firstly, we show that the layer-wise weights in LISTA need not be learned from data. That is based on decoupling LISTA training into a data-free analytic optimization stage followed by a lighter-weight data-driven learning stage without compromising the optimal linear convergence rate proved in (Chen et al., 2018). We establish a minimum-coherence criterion between the desired LISTA weights and the dictionary  $\mathbf{D}$ , which leads to an efficient algorithm that can analytically solve the former from the latter, independent of the distribution of  $\mathbf{x}$ . The data-driven training is then reduced to learning layer-wise step sizes and thresholds only, which will fit the distribution of  $\mathbf{x}$ . The new scheme, called Analytic LISTA (ALISTA), provides important insights into the working mechanism of LISTA. Experiments show ALISTA to perform comparably with previous LISTA models (Gregor & LeCun, 2010; Chen et al., 2018) with much lighter-weight training. Then, We extend the above discussions and conclusions to CSC, and introduce an efficient algorithm to solve the convolutional version of coherence minimization. Further, we introduce a new robust LISTA learning scheme benefiting from the decoupled structure, by adding perturbations to  $\mathbf{D}$  during training. The resulting model is shown to possess much stronger robustness when the input distribution varies, even when  $\mathbf{D}$  changes to some extent, compared to classical LISTA models that learn to (over-)fit one specific  $\mathbf{D}$ .

# 2 ANALYTIC LISTA: CALCULATING WEIGHTS WITHOUT TRAINING

We theoretically analyze the LISTA form defined in (Chen et al., 2018):

$$
\mathbf {x} ^ {(k + 1)} = \eta_ {\theta^ {(k)}} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} - \left(\mathbf {W} ^ {(k)}\right) ^ {T} \left(\mathbf {D} \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} - \mathbf {b}\right)\right), \tag {6}
$$

where  $\mathbf{W}^{(k)} = [\mathbf{w}_1^{(k)},\dots ,\mathbf{w}_M^{(k)}]\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times M}$  is a linear operator with the same dimensionality with  $\mathbf{D},\mathbf{x}^{(k)} = [x_1^{(k)},\dots ,x_M^{(k)}]$  is the  $k^{\mathrm{th}}$  layer node. In (6),  $\Theta = \{\mathbf{W}^{(k)},\theta^{(k)}\}_{k}$  are parameters to train. Model (6) can be derived from (4) with  $\mathbf{W}_1^{(k)} = (\mathbf{W}^{(k)})^T,\mathbf{W}_2^{(k)} = \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{W}_1^{(k)}\mathbf{D}$ . (Chen et al., 2018) showed that (6) has the same representation capability with (4) on the sparse recovery problem, with a specifically light weight structure.

Our theoretical analysis will further define and establish properties of "good" parameters  $\Theta$  in (6), and then discuss how to analytically computer those good parameters rather than relying solely on black-box training. In this way, the LISTA model could be further significantly simplified, without little performance loss. The proofs of all the theorems in this paper are provided in the appendix.

# 2.1 RECOVERY ERROR UPPER BOUND

We start with an assumption on the "ground truth" signal  $\mathbf{x}^*$  and the noise  $\varepsilon$ .

Assumption 1 (Basic assumptions). Signal  $\mathbf{x}^*$  is sampled from the following set:

$$
\mathbf {x} ^ {*} \in \mathcal {X} (B, s) \triangleq \left\{\mathbf {x} ^ {*} \left| | x _ {i} ^ {*} | \leq B, \forall i, \| \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \| _ {0} \leq s \right. \right\}. \tag {7}
$$

In other words,  $\mathbf{x}^*$  is bounded and  $s$ -sparse<sup>2</sup> ( $s \geq 2$ ). Furthermore, we assume  $\varepsilon = 0$ .

The zero-noise assumption is for simplicity of the proofs. Our experiments will show that our models are robust to noisy cases.

Definition 1. Given  $\mathbf{D} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times M}$  with each of its column normalized, a weight matrix  $\mathbf{W}$  is "good" if it belongs to

$$
\mathcal {W} (\mathbf {D}) = \underset {\substack {\mathbf {W} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {N \times M} \\ \left(\mathbf {W} _ {:, i}\right) ^ {T} \mathbf {D} _ {:, i} = 1, 1 \leq i \leq M}} {\arg \min } \left\{\underset {1 \leq i, j \leq M} {\max } \left(\mathbf {W} _ {:, i}\right) ^ {T} \mathbf {D} _ {:, j} \right\}, \tag{8}
$$

Taking a  $\mathbf{W} \in \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{D})$ , we define the generalized mutual coherence:

$$
\tilde {\mu} (\mathbf {D}) = \max  _ { \begin{array}{c} i \neq j \\ 1 \leq i, j \leq M \end{array} } \left| \left(\mathbf {W} _ {:, i}\right) ^ {\top} \mathbf {D} _ {:, j} \right|. \tag {9}
$$

Theorem 1 (Recovery error upper bound). Take any  $\mathbf{x}^* \in \mathcal{X}(B, s)$ , any  $\mathbf{W} \in \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{D})$ , and any sequence  $\gamma^{(k)} \in (0, \frac{2}{2\tilde{\mu}s - \tilde{\mu} + 1})$ . Using them, define the parameters  $\{\mathbf{W}^{(k)}, \theta^{(k)}\}$ :

$$
\mathbf {W} ^ {(k)} = \gamma^ {(k)} \mathbf {W}, \quad \theta^ {(k)} = \gamma^ {(k)} \tilde {\mu} (\mathbf {D}) \sup  _ {\mathbf {x} ^ {*} \in \mathcal {X} (B, s)} \left\{\| \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {*}\right) - \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \| _ {1} \right\}, \tag {10}
$$

while the sequence  $\{\mathbf{x}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x}^*)\}_{k = 1}^{\infty}$  is generated by (6) using the above parameters and  $\mathbf{x}^{(0)} = \mathbf{0}$ . (Each  $\mathbf{x}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x}^*)$  depends only on  $\theta^{(k - 1)},\theta^{(k - 2)},\ldots$  and defines  $\theta^{(k)}$ .) Let Assumption 1 hold with any  $B > 0$  and  $s < (1 + 1 / \tilde{\mu}) / 2$ . Then, we have

$$
\operatorname {s u p p o r t} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {*}\right)\right) \subset \mathbb {S}, \quad \| \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {*}\right) - \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \| _ {2} \leq s B \exp \left(- \sum_ {\tau = 0} ^ {k - 1} c ^ {(\tau)}\right), \quad k = 1, 2, \dots \tag {11}
$$

where  $\mathbb{S}$  is the support of  $\mathbf{x}^*$  and  $c^{(k)} = -\log \left((2\tilde{\mu}s - \tilde{\mu})\gamma^{(k)} + |1 - \gamma^{(k)}|\right)$  is a positive constant.

In Theorem 1, Eqn. (10) defines the properties of "good" parameters:

- The weights  $\mathbf{W}^{(k)}$  can be separated as the product of a scalar  $\gamma^{(k)}$  and a matrix  $\mathbf{W}$  independent of layer index  $k$ .  
- W has small coherence with D.  
-  $\gamma^{(k)}$  is bounded in an interval.  
-  $\theta^{(k)} / \gamma^{(k)}$  is proportional to the  $\ell_1$  error of the output of the  $k^{\mathrm{th}}$  layer.

The factor  $c^{(k)}$  takes the maximum at  $\gamma^{(k)} = 1$ . If  $\gamma^{(k)} \equiv 1$ , the recovery error converges to zero in a linear rate (Chen et al., 2018):

$$
\left\| \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {*}\right) - \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \right\| _ {2} \leq s B \exp (- c k),
$$

where  $c = -\log (2\tilde{\mu} s - \tilde{\mu})\geq c^{(k)}$ . Although  $\gamma^{(k)}\equiv 1$  gives the optimal theoretical upper bound if there are infinitely many layers  $k = 0,1,2,\dots$ , it is not the optimal choice for finite  $k$ . Practically, there are finitely many layers and  $\gamma^{(k)}$  obtained by learning is bounded in an interval.

# 2.2 RECOVERY ERROR LOWER BOUND

In this subsection, we introduce a lower bound of the recovery error of LISTA, which illustrates that the parameters analytically given by (10) are optimal in the convergence order (linear) too.

Assumption 2. The signal  $\mathbf{x}^*$  is a random variable following the distribution  $P_{X}$ . Let  $\mathbb{S} = \text{support}(\mathbf{x}^*)$ .  $P_{X}$  satisfies:  $2 \leq |\mathbb{S}| \leq s$ ;  $\mathbb{S}$  uniformly distributes on the whole index set; nonzero part  $\mathbf{x}_{\mathbb{S}}^*$  satisfies the uniform distribution with bound  $B$ :  $|x_i^*| \leq B, \forall i \in \mathbb{S}$ . Moreover, the observation noise  $\varepsilon = 0$ .

Definition 2. Given  $\mathbf{D} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times M}$ ,  $s \geq 2$ ,  $\bar{\sigma}_{\min} > 0$ , we define a set that  $\mathbf{W}^{(k)}$  are chosen from:

$$
\bar {\mathcal {W}} (\mathbf {D}, s, \bar {\sigma} _ {\min }) = \left\{\mathbf {W} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {N \times M} \Big | \sigma_ {\min } \left(\mathbf {I} - \left(\mathbf {W} _ {:, \mathbb {S}}\right) ^ {T} \mathbf {D} _ {:, \mathbb {S}}\right) \geq \bar {\sigma} _ {\min }, \forall \mathbb {S} s. t. 2 \leq | \mathbb {S} | \leq s \right\}. \tag {12}
$$

Theorem 1 tells that an ideal weight  $\mathbf{W} \in \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{D})$  satisfies  $\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{D} \approx \mathbf{0}$ . But this cannot be met exactly in the overcomplete  $\mathbf{D}$  case, i.e.,  $N < M$ . Definition 2 addresses this point.

Definition 3. Based on Definition 2, we define a set that  $\Theta = \{\mathbf{W}^{(k)},\theta^{(k)}\}_{k = 0}^{\infty}$  are chosen from:

$$
\mathcal {T} = \left\{\left\{\mathbf {W} ^ {(k)}, \theta^ {(k)} \right\} _ {k = 0} ^ {\infty} \mid \mathbf {W} ^ {(k)} \in \bar {\mathcal {W}} (\mathbf {D}, s, \bar {\sigma} _ {\min }) \text {, s u p p o r t} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {*}\right)\right) \subset \mathbb {S}, \forall \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \in \mathcal {X} (B, s), \forall k \right\} \tag {13}
$$

The conclusion (11) demonstrates that  $\mathcal{T}$  is nonempty because “ $\mathrm{support}(\mathbf{x}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x}^{*})) \subset \mathbb{S}$ ” (no false positive) is satisfied as long as  $\theta^{(k)}$  large enough. Actually,  $\mathcal{T}$  contains almost all “good” parameters because considerable false positives lead to large recovery errors. With  $\mathcal{T}$  defined, we have:

Theorem 2 (Recovery error lower bound). Let the sequence  $\{\mathbf{x}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x}^*)\}_{k = 1}^{\infty}$  be generated by (6) with  $\{\mathbf{W}^{(k)},\theta^{(k)}\}_{k = 0}^{\infty}$  and  $\mathbf{x}^{(0)} = \mathbf{0}$ . Under Assumption 2, for all parameters  $\{\mathbf{W}^{(k)},\theta^{(k)}\}_{k = 0}^{\infty}\in \mathcal{T}$  and any sufficient small  $\epsilon >0$ , we have

$$
\left\| \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {*}\right) - \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \right\| _ {2} \geq \epsilon \left\| \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \right\| _ {2} \exp (- \bar {c} k), \tag {14}
$$

with probability at least  $(1 - \epsilon s^{3 / 2} - \epsilon^2)$ , where  $\bar{c} = s\log (3) - \log (\bar{\sigma}_{min})$

This theorem illustrates that, with high probability, the convergence rate of LISTA cannot be faster than a linear rate. Thus, the parameters given in (10), that leads to the linear convergence if  $\gamma^k$  is bounded within an interval near 1, are optimal with respect to the order of convergence of LISTA.

# 2.3 ANALYTIC LISTA: LESS PARAMETERS TO LEARN

Following Theorems 1 and 2, we set  $\mathbf{W}^{(k)} = \gamma^{(k)}\mathbf{W}$ , where  $\gamma^{(k)}$  is a scalar, and propose Tied LISTA:

$$
\mathbf {x} ^ {(k + 1)} = \eta_ {\theta (k)} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} - \gamma^ {(k)} \mathbf {W} ^ {T} \left(\mathbf {D} \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} - \mathbf {b}\right)\right), \tag {15}
$$

where  $\Theta = \{\{\gamma^{(k)}\}_{k}, \{\theta^{(k)}\}_{k}, \mathbf{W}\}$  are parameters to train. The matrix  $\mathbf{W}$  is tied over all the layers. Further, we notice that the selection of  $\mathbf{W}$  from  $\mathcal{W}(\mathbf{D})$  depends on  $\mathbf{D}$  only. Hence we propose the analytic LISTA (ALISTA) that decomposes tied-LISTA into two stages:

$$
\mathbf {x} ^ {(k + 1)} = \eta_ {\theta^ {(k)}} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} - \gamma^ {(k)} \tilde {\mathbf {W}} ^ {T} \left(\mathbf {D} \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} - \mathbf {b}\right)\right), \tag {16}
$$

where  $\tilde{\mathbf{W}}$  is pre-computed by solving the following problem (Stage 1):

$$
\tilde {\mathbf {W}} \in \underset {\mathbf {W} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {N \times M}} {\arg \min } \| \mathbf {W} ^ {T} \mathbf {D} \| _ {F} ^ {2}, \quad \text {s . t .} (\mathbf {W} _ {:, m}) ^ {T} \mathbf {D} _ {:, m} = 1, \forall m = 1, 2, \dots , M. \tag {17}
$$

Then with  $\tilde{\mathbf{W}}$  fixed,  $\{\gamma^{(k)},\theta^{(k)}\}_{k}$  in (16) are learned from end to end (Stage 2). (17) reformulates (8) to minimizing the Frobenius norm of  $\mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{D}$  (a quadratic objective), over linear constraints. This is a standard convex quadratic program, which is easy to solve.

# 3 CONVOLUTIONAL ANALYTIC LISTA

We extend the analytic LISTA to the convolutional case in this section, starting from discussing the convolutional sparse coding (CSC). Many works studied CSC and proposed efficient algorithms for that (Bristow et al., 2013; Heide et al., 2015; Wohlberg, 2014; 2016; Papyan et al., 2017; Garcia-Cardona & Wohlberg, 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017; 2018). In CSC, the general linear transform is replaced by convolutions in order to learn spatially invariant features:

$$
\mathbf {b} = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \mathbf {d} _ {m} * \mathbf {x} _ {m} ^ {*} + \varepsilon , \tag {18}
$$

where each  $\mathbf{d}_m$  is a dictionary kernel (or filter).  $\{\mathbf{d}_m\}_{m = 1}^M$  is the dictionary of filters,  $M$  denotes the number of filters.  $\{\mathbf{x}_m^*\}_{m = 1}^M$  is the set of coefficient maps that are assumed to have sparse structure, and  $*$  is the convolution operator. Now we consider 2D convolution. Let  $\mathbf{b}\in \mathbb{R}^{N^2}$ ,  $\mathbf{d}_m\in \mathbb{R}^{D^2}$ ,  $\mathbf{x}_m\in \mathbb{R}^{(N + D - 1)^2}$ . Equation (18) is pointwisely defined as:

$$
\mathbf {b} (i, j) = \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {D - 1} \sum_ {l = 0} ^ {D - 1} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \mathbf {d} _ {m} (k, l) \mathbf {x} _ {m} (i + k, j + l) + \varepsilon (i, j), \quad 0 \leq i, j \leq N - 1. \tag {19}
$$

We vectorize  $\mathbf{b},\mathbf{d}_m,\mathbf{x}_m$  and let  $\mathbf{d} = [\mathbf{d}_1,\dots ,\mathbf{d}_M]^T$  and  $\mathbf{x} = [\mathbf{x}_1,\dots ,\mathbf{x}_M]^T$ . Then the above transform can be written as

$$
\mathbf {b} = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \mathbf {D} _ {\operatorname {c o n v}, m} ^ {N} \left(\mathbf {d} _ {m}\right) \mathbf {x} _ {m} + \varepsilon = \mathbf {D} _ {\operatorname {c o n v}} ^ {N} (\mathbf {d}) \mathbf {x} + \varepsilon , \tag {20}
$$

where  $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{d}) = [\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{conv},1}^N (\mathbf{d}_1),\dots ,\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{conv},M}^N (\mathbf{d}_M)]\in \mathbb{R}^{N^2\times (N + D - 1)^2 M}$  is a matrix depending on the signal size  $N$  and the dictionary  $\mathbf{d}$ .

From (18), the convolutional LISTA becomes a natural extension of the fully-connected LISTA (6):

$$
\mathbf {x} _ {m} ^ {(k + 1)} = \eta_ {\theta^ {(k)}} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {m} ^ {(k)} - \mathbf {w} _ {m} ^ {(k)} * \left(\sum_ {\bar {m} = 1} ^ {M} \mathbf {d} _ {\bar {m}} * \mathbf {x} _ {\bar {m}} ^ {(k)} - \mathbf {b}\right)\right), \quad m = 1, 2, \dots , M, \tag {21}
$$

where  $\{\mathbf{w}_m^{(k)}\}_{m = 1}^M$  share the same sizes with  $\{\mathbf{d}_m\}_{m = 1}^M$ . Let  $\mathbf{w}^{(k)} = [\mathbf{w}_1^{(k)},\dots ,\mathbf{w}_M^{(k)}]^T\in \mathbb{R}^{D^2 M}$ . Parameters to train are  $\Theta = \{\mathbf{w}^{(k)},\theta^{(k)}\}_{k}$ .

Let  $\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{w}^{(k)})$  be the matrix induced by dictionary  $\mathbf{w}^{(k)}$  with the same dimensionality as  $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{d})$ . Since convolution can be written as a matrix form (20), (21) is equivalent to

$$
\mathbf {x} ^ {(k + 1)} = \eta_ {\theta^ {(k)}} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} - \left(\mathbf {W} _ {\operatorname {c o n v}} ^ {N} \left(\mathbf {w} ^ {(k)}\right)\right) ^ {T} \left(\mathbf {D} _ {\operatorname {c o n v}} ^ {N} (\mathbf {d}) \mathbf {x} ^ {(k)} - \mathbf {b}\right)\right). \tag {22}
$$

Then by just substituting  $\mathbf{D}$ ,  $\mathbf{W}^{(k)}$  with  $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{d})$ ,  $\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{w}^{(k)})$  respectively, Theorems 1 and 2 can be applied to the convolutional LISTA.

Proposition 1. Let  $\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{conv}}^{N}(\mathbf{d})$  and  $\mathbf{W}^{(k)} = \mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{conv}}^{N}(\mathbf{w}^{(k)})$ . With Assumption 1 and other settings the same with those in Theorem 1, (11) holds. With Assumption 2 and other settings the same with those in Theorem 2, (14) holds.

Similar to the fully connected case (16), based on the results in Proposition 1, we should set  $\mathbf{w}_m^{(k)} = \gamma_m^{(k)}\tilde{\mathbf{w}}_m$ ,  $m = 1,2,\dots ,M$ , where  $\tilde{\mathbf{w}} = [\tilde{\mathbf{w}}_1,\dots ,\tilde{\mathbf{w}}_M]^T$  is chosen from

$$
\tilde {\mathbf {w}} \in \mathcal {W} _ {\text {c o n v}} ^ {N} = \underset { \begin{array}{l} \mathbf {w} _ {m} \cdot \mathbf {d} _ {m} = 1, 1 \leq m \leq M \\ \end{array} } {\arg \min } \left\| \left(\mathbf {W} _ {\text {c o n v}} ^ {N} (\mathbf {w})\right) ^ {T} \mathbf {D} _ {\text {c o n v}} ^ {N} (\mathbf {d}) \right\| _ {F} ^ {2}. \tag {23}
$$

However, (23) is not as efficient to solve as (17). To see that, matrices  $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{d})$  and  $\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{w})$  are both of size  $N^2\times (N + D - 1)^2 M$ , the coherence matrix  $\left(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{w})\right)^T\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{d})$  is thus of size  $(N + D - 1)^2 M\times (N + D - 1)^2 M$ . In the typical application setting of CSC,  $\mathbf{b}$  is usually an image rather than a small patch. For example, if the image size is  $100\times 100$ , dictionary size is  $7\times 7\times 64$ ,  $N = 100$ ,  $D = 7$ ,  $M = 64$ , then  $(N + D - 1)^2 M\times (N + D - 1)^2 M\approx 5\times 10^{11}$ .

# 3.1 CALCULATING CONVOLUTIONAL WEIGHTS ANALYTICALLY AND EFFICIENTLY

To overcome the computational challenge of solving (23), we exploit the following circular convolution as an efficient approximated way:

$$
\mathbf {b} (i, j) = \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {D - 1} \sum_ {l = 0} ^ {D - 1} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \mathbf {d} _ {m} (k, l) \mathbf {x} _ {m} \left((i + k) _ {\mathrm {m o d} N}, (j + l) _ {\mathrm {m o d} N}\right) + \varepsilon (i, j), \quad 0 \leq i, j \leq N - 1, \tag {24}
$$

where  $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{N^2}$ ,  $\mathbf{d}_m \in \mathbb{R}^{D^2}$ ,  $\mathbf{x}_m \in \mathbb{R}^{N^2}$ . The corresponding matrix form of (24) is:

$$
\mathbf {b} = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {M} \mathbf {D} _ {\operatorname {c i r}, m} ^ {N} (\mathbf {d} _ {m}) \mathbf {x} _ {m} + \varepsilon = \mathbf {D} _ {\operatorname {c i r}} ^ {N} (\mathbf {d}) \mathbf {x} + \varepsilon ,
$$

where  $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N (\mathbf{d}):\mathbb{R}^{N^2 M}\to \mathbb{R}^{N^2}$  is a matrix depending on the signal size  $N$  and the dictionary  $\mathbf{d}$ . Then the coherence minimization with the circular convolution is given by

$$
\mathcal {W} _ {\operatorname {c i r}} ^ {N} = \underset {\substack {\mathbf {w} _ {m} \cdot \mathbf {d} _ {m} = 1, 1 \leq m \leq M}} {\arg \min } \left\| \left(\mathbf {W} _ {\operatorname {c i r}} ^ {N} (\mathbf {w})\right) ^ {T} \mathbf {D} _ {\operatorname {c i r}} ^ {N} (\mathbf {d}) \right\| _ {F} ^ {2}. \tag{25}
$$

The following theorem motivates us to use the solution to (25) to approximate that of (23).

Theorem 3. The solution sets of (23) and (25) satisfy the following properties:

1.  $\mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{cir}}^N = \mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{cir}}^{2D - 1},\forall N\geq 2D - 1.$  
2. If at least one of the matrices  $\{\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{cir},1}^{2D - 1},\dots ,\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{cir},M}^{2D - 1}\}$  is non-singular,  $\mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{cir}}^{2D - 1}$  involves only a unique element. Furthermore,

$$
\lim  _ {N \rightarrow \infty} \mathcal {W} _ {\text {c o n v}} ^ {N} = \mathcal {W} _ {\text {c i r}} ^ {2 D - 1}. \tag {26}
$$

The solution set  $\mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{cir}}^N$  is not related with the image size  $N$  as long as  $N \geq 2D - 1$ , thus one can deal with a much smaller-size problem (let  $N = 2D - 1$ ). Further, (26) indicates that as  $N$  gets (much) larger than  $D$ , the boundary condition becomes less important. Thus, one can use  $\mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{cir}}^{2D - 1}$  to approximate  $\mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N$ . In Appendix D, we introduce the algorithm details of solving (25).

Based on Proposition 1 and Theorem 3, we obtain the convolutional ALISTA:

$$
\mathbf {x} _ {m} ^ {(k + 1)} = \eta_ {\theta^ {(k)}} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {m} ^ {(k)} - \gamma_ {m} ^ {(k)} \tilde {\mathbf {w}} _ {m} * \left(\sum_ {\bar {m} = 1} ^ {M} \mathbf {d} _ {\bar {m}} * \mathbf {x} _ {\bar {m}} ^ {(k)} - \mathbf {b}\right)\right), \quad m = 1, 2, \dots , M, \tag {27}
$$

where  $\tilde{\mathbf{w}} = [\tilde{\mathbf{w}}_1,\dots ,\tilde{\mathbf{w}}_M]^T\in \mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{cir}}^{2D - 1}$  and  $\Theta = \{\{\gamma_m^{(k)}\}_{m,k},\{\theta^{(k)}\}_k\}$  are the parameters to train. (27) is a simplified form, compared to the empirically unfolded CSC model recently proposed in (Sreter & Giryes, 2018)

# 4 ROBUST ALISTA TO MODEL PERTURBATION

Many applications, such as often found in surveillance video scenarios (Zhao et al., 2011; Han et al., 2013), can be formulated as sparse coding models whose dictionaries are subject to small dynamic perturbations (e.g., slowly varied over time). Specifically, the linear system model (1) may have uncertain  $\mathbf{D}$ :  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}} = \mathbf{D} + \varepsilon_{D}$ , where  $\varepsilon_{D}$  is some small stochastic perturbation. Classical LISTA entangles the learning of all its parameters, and the trained model is tied to one static  $\mathbf{D}$ . The important contribution of ALISTA is to decompose fitting  $\mathbf{W}$  w.r.t.  $\mathbf{D}$ , from adapting other parameters  $\{\gamma^{(k)},\theta^{(k)}\}_{k}$  to training data.

In this section, we develop a robust variant of ALISTA that is a fast regressor not only for a given  $\mathbf{D}$ , but all its randomly perturbations  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$  to some extent. Up to our best knowledge, this approach is new. Robust ALISTA can be sketched as the following empirical routine (at each iteration):

- Sample a perturbed dictionary  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$ . Sample  $\mathbf{x}$  and  $\varepsilon$  to generate  $\mathbf{b}$  w.r.t.  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$ .  
- Apply Stage 1 of ALISTA w.r.t.  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$  and obtain  $\tilde{\mathbf{W}}$ ; however, instead of an iterative minimization algorithm, we use a neural network that unfolds that algorithm to produce  $\tilde{\mathbf{W}}$ .  
- Apply Stage 2 of ALISTA w.r.t.  $\tilde{\mathbf{W}}$ ,  $\mathbf{D}$ ,  $\mathbf{x}$ , and  $\mathbf{b}$  to obtain  $\{\gamma^{(k)}, \theta^{(k)}\}_{k}$ .

In Robust ALISTA above,  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$  becomes a part of the data for training the neural network that generates  $\tilde{\mathbf{W}}$ . This neural network is faster to apply than the minimization algorithm. One might attempt to use  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$  in the last step, rather than  $\mathbf{D}$ , but  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$  makes training less stable, potentially because of larger weight variations between training iterations due to the random perturbations in  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$ . We observe that using  $\mathbf{D}$  stabilizes training better and empirically achieves a good prediction. More details of training Robust ALISTA are given in Appendix E.

# 5 NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthesized and real data to demonstrate:

- We experimentally validate Theorems 1 and 2, and show that ALISTA is as effective as classical LISTA (Gregor & LeCun, 2010; Chen et al., 2018) but is much easier to train.  
- Similar conclusions can be drawn for convolutional analytic LISTA.  
- The robust analytic LISTA further shows remarkable robustness in sparse code prediction, given that  $\mathbf{D}$  is randomly perturbed within some extent.

Notation For brevity, we let LISTA denote the vanilla LISTA model (4) in (Gregor & LeCun, 2010); LISTA-CPSS refers to the lately-proposed fast LISTA variant (Chen et al., 2018) with weight coupling and support selection; TiLISTA is the tied LISTA (15); and ALISTA is our proposed Analytic LISTA (16). If the model is for convolutional case, then we add "Conv" as the prefix for model name, such as "Conv ALISTA" that represents the convolutional analytic LISTA.

# 5.1 VALIDATION OF THEOREMS 1 AND 2 (ANALYTIC LISTA)

We follow the same  $N = 250$ ,  $M = 500$  setting as (Chen et al., 2018) by default. We sample the entries of  $\mathbf{D}$  i.i.d. from the standard Gaussian distribution,  $\mathbf{D}_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1/N)$  and then normalize its columns to have the unit  $\ell_2$  norm. We fix a dictionary  $\mathbf{D}$  in this section. To generate sparse vectors  $\mathbf{x}^*$ , we decide each of its entry to be non-zero following the Bernoulli distribution with  $p_b = 0.1$ . The values of the non-zero entries are sampled from the standard Gaussian distribution. A test set of 1000 samples generated in the above manner is fixed for all tests in our simulations. The analytic weight  $W$  that we use in the ALISTA is obtained by solving (17).

All networks used (vanilla LISTA, LISTA-CPSS, TiLISTA and ALISTA) have the same number of 16 layers. We also include two classical iterative solvers: ISTA and FISTA. We train the networks with four different levels of noises: SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) = 20, 30, 40, and  $\infty$ . While our theory mainly discussed the noise-free case ( $SNR = \infty$ ), we hope to empirically study the algorithm performance under noise too. As shown in Figure 1, the x-axes denotes the indices of layers for the networks, or the number of iterations for the iterative algorithms. The y-axes represent the NMSE (Normalized Mean Squared Error) in the decibel (dB) unit:

$$
\mathrm {N M S E} _ {\mathrm {d B}} (\hat {\mathbf {x}}, \mathbf {x} ^ {*}) = 1 0 \log_ {1 0} \left(\mathbb {E} \| \hat {\mathbf {x}} - \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \| ^ {2} / \mathbb {E} \| \mathbf {x} ^ {*} \| ^ {2}\right),
$$

where  $\mathbf{x}^*$  is the ground truth and  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$  is the estimated one.

(d) Noisy Case:  $\mathrm{SNR} = 20\mathrm{dB}$

In Figure 1 (a) noise-less case, all four learned models apparently converge much faster than two iterative solvers (ISTA/FISTA curves almost overlap in this y-scale, at the small number of iterations). Among the four networks, classical-LISTA is inferior to the other three by an obvious margin. LISTA-CPSS, TiLISTA and ALISTA perform comparably: ALISTA is observed to eventually achieve the lowest NMSE. Figure 1(a) (a) also supports Theorem 2, that all networks have at most linear convergence, regardless of how freely their parameters can be end-to-end learned.

Figure 1 (b) - (d) further show that even in the presence of noise, ALISTA can empirically perform comparably with LISTA-CPSS and TiLISTA, and stay clearly better than LISTA and ISTA/FISTA. Always note that ALISTA the smallest amount of parameters to learn from the end-to-end training

(Stage 2). The above results endorse that: i) the optimal LISTA layer-wise weights could be structured as  $\mathbf{W}^{(k)} = \gamma^{(k)}\mathbf{W}$ ; and ii)  $\mathbf{W}$  could be analytically solved rather than learned from data, without incurring performance loss. We also observe the significant reduction of training time for ALISTA: while LISTA-CPSS of the same depth took 6.5 hours to train, ALISTA was trained with 1.5 hours, on the same hardware (one 1080 Ti on server).

(b)  $\theta^k /\gamma^k$

We further supply Figures 2 and 3 to support Theorem 1 from different perspectives. Figure 2 plots the learned parameters  $\{\gamma^{(k)},\theta^{(k)}\}$  in ALISTA (Stage 2), showing that they satisfy the properties proposed in Theorem 1:  $\gamma^{(k)}$  bounded;  $\theta^{(k)}$  and  $\gamma^{(k)}$  is proportional to  $\sup_{\mathbf{x}^*}\| \mathbf{x}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x}^*) - \mathbf{x}^*\| _1$  ("sup  ${}_{\mathbf{x}^{*}}$  ) is taken over the test set). Figure 3 reports the average magnitude of the

false positives and the true positives in  $\mathbf{x}^k (\mathbf{x}^*)$  of ALISTA: the "true positives" curve draws the values of  $\mathbb{E}\{\| \mathbf{x}_{\mathbb{S}}^k (\mathbf{x}^*)\| _2^2 /\| \mathbf{x}^k (\mathbf{x}^*)\| _2^2\}$  w.r.t.  $k$  (the expectation is taken over the test set), while "false positives" for  $\mathbb{E}\{\| \mathbf{x}_{\mathbb{S}^c}^k (\mathbf{x}^*)\| _2^2 /\| \mathbf{x}^k (\mathbf{x}^*)\| _2^2\}$ . The results support the Theorem 1 conclusion that support  $(\mathbf{x}^{k}(\mathbf{x}^{*}))\subset \mathbb{S}$ .

# 5.2 VALIDATION OF THEOREM 3 (CONVOLUTIONAL ANALYTIC LISTA)

For convolutional cases, we use real image data to verify Theorem 3. We train a convolutional dictionary  $\mathbf{d}$  with  $D = 7$ ,  $M = 64$  on the BSD500 training set (400 images), using the Algorithm 1 in (Liu et al., 2018). We then use it for problems (23) and (25) and solve them with different  $N$ s.

In Table 1, we take  $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{cir}}^N \in \mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{cir}}^N$ ,  $\mathbf{w}^* \in \mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{cir}}^{50}$  (consider 50 as large enough) For this example,  $\mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{cir}}^N$  has only one element. Table 1 shows that  $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{cir}}^N = \mathbf{w}^*$  for  $N \geq 13$ , i.e., the solution of the problem (25) is independent of  $N$  if  $N \geq 2D - 1$ , justifying the first conclusion in Theorem 3. In Table 2, we take  $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N \in \mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N$  and  $\mathbf{w}^* \in \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{cir}}^{13}$ , where  $\mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N$  also has only one element. Table 2 shows  $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{conv}}^N \rightarrow \mathbf{w}^*$ , i.e., the solution of the problem (23) converges to that of (25) as  $N$  increases, validating the second conclusion of Theorem 3. Visualized  $\mathbf{w}^* \in \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{cir}}^{13}$  is displayed in Appendix F.

Besides validating Theorem 3, we also present a real image denoising experiment to verify the effectiveness of Conv ALISTA. The detailed settings and results are presented in Appendix G.

# 5.3 VALIDATION OF ROBUST ALISTA

We empirically verify the effectiveness of Robust ALISTA, by sampling the dictionary perturbation  $\varepsilon_{D}$  entry-wise i.i.d. from another Gaussian distribution  $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_{max}^{2})$ . We choose  $\sigma_{max} = 0.02$  and 0.03. Other simulation settings are by default the same as in Section 5.1. We then build the Robust ALISTA model, following the strategy in Section 4 and using a 4-layer encoder for approximating its second step (see Appendix E for details). Correspondingly, we compare Robust ALISTA with TiLISTA and ALISTA with specific data augmentation: we straightforwardly augment their training sets, by including all data generated with randomly perturbed  $\tilde{\mathbf{D}}$ s when training Robust ALISTA. We also include the data-free FISTA algorithm into the comparison.

Figure 4 plots the results when the trained models are applied on the testing data, generated with the same dictionary and perturbed by  $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_t)$ . We vary  $\sigma_t$  from zero to slightly above  $\sigma_{max}$ . Not surprisingly, FISTA is unaffected, while the other three data-driven models all slight degrade as  $\sigma_t$  increases. Compared to the augmented TiLISTA and ALISTA whose performance are both inferior to FISTA, the proposed Robust ALISTA appears to be much more favorable in improving robustness to model perturbations. In both  $\sigma_{max}$  cases, it consistently achieves much lower NMSE than FISTA, even when  $\sigma_t$  has slightly surpassed  $\sigma_{max}$ . Although the NMSE of ALISTA may decrease faster if  $\sigma_t$  continues growing larger, such decrease could be alleviated by improving  $\sigma_{max}$  in training, e.g., by comparing  $\sigma_{max} = 0.02$  and 0.03. Robust ALISTA demonstrates remarkable robustness and maintains the best NMSE performance, within at least the  $[0,\sigma_{max}]$  range.

# 6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Based on the recent theoretical advances of LISTA, we have made further steps to reduce the training complexity and improve the robustness of LISTA. Specifically, we no longer train any matrix for LISTA but directly use the solution to an analytic minimization problem to solve for its layer-wise weights. Therefore, only two scalar sequences (stepsizes and thresholds) still need to be trained. Excluding the matrix from training is backed by our theoretical upper and lower bounds. The resulting method, Analytic LISTA or ALISTA, is not only faster to train but performs as well as the state-of-the-art variant of LISTA by (Chen et al., 2018). This discovery motivates us to further replace the minimization algorithm by its unfolding neural network, and train this neural network to more quickly produce the weight matrix. The resulting algorithm is used to handle perturbations in the model dictionary — we only train once for a dictionary with all its small perturbations. Our future work will investigate the theoretical sensitivity of ALISTA (and its convolutional version) to noisy measurements.
