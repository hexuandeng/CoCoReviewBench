# ABSTRACT

Adversarial training is the standard to train models robust against adversarial examples. However, especially for complex datasets, adversarial training incurs a significant loss in accuracy and is known to generalize poorly to stronger attacks, e.g., larger perturbations or other threat models. In this paper, we introduce confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT) where the key idea is to enforce that the confidence on adversarial examples decays with their distance to the attacked examples. We show that CCAT preserves better the accuracy of normal training while robustness against adversarial examples is achieved via confidence thresholding. Most importantly, in strong contrast to adversarial training, the robustness of CCAT generalizes to larger perturbations and other threat models, not encountered during training. We also discuss our extensive work to design strong adaptive attacks against CCAT and standard adversarial training which is of independent interest. We present experimental results on MNIST, SVHN and Cifar10.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep neural networks have shown tremendous improvements in various learning tasks including applications in computer vision, natural language processing or text processing. However, the discovery of adversarial examples, i.e., nearly imperceptibly perturbed inputs that cause mis-classification, has revealed severe security threats, as demonstrated by attacking popular computer vision services such as Google Cloud Vision (Ilyas et al., 2018a) or Clarifai (Liu et al., 2016; Bhagoji et al., 2017). As the number of safety- and privacy-critical applications is increasing, e.g., autonomous driving or medical imaging, this problem becomes even more important.

While defenses promising certified robustness against adversarial examples have received considerable attention (Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017; Wong & Kolter, 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2018), such approaches are limited to small networks and often lead to significantly increased test error. In practice, adversarial training, i.e., training on adversarial examples as proposed by Madry et al. (2018), can be regarded as the state-of-the-art and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been broken so far. However, adversarial training is known to increase test error significantly. Only on simple datasets such as MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), adversarial training is able to preserve accuracy. This observation is typically described as a trade-off between robustness and accuracy (Schmidt et al., 2018; Stutz et al., 2019). Furthermore, the success of adversarial training strongly depends on the attack used during training. The achieved robustness does not translate to novel attacks, e.g., allowing larger adversarial perturbations at test time or different threat models (Song et al., 2018; Sharma & Chen, 2017).

Contributions: We aim to address both problems: the robustness-accuracy trade-off and the poor generalization to other or stronger attacks. To this end, we introduce confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT) based on the idea that the confidence in an adversarial example should decrease as a function of the distance to the attacked data point. Specifically, we bias the network to predict for the adversarial example a convex combination of the uniform distribution over the labels and the label of the attacked point, which tends to become uniform as the distance to the attacked point increases. We show that this novel procedure of adversarial training leads to better "generalization" of the robustness to both stronger attacks and other threat models. This is in contrast to

standard adversarial training, which does not in general generalize to other attacks. The main reason is that adversarial training does not tell the network how to extrapolate beyond the specific perturbations seen during training, which we overcome with CCAT. We show that our approach allows to detect adversarial examples based on their confidence while better preserving the accuracy of normal training, thereby improving also upon the robustness-accuracy trade-off of regular adversarial training. We will make our code and results publicly available.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Adversarial examples are roughly divided into white-box attacks, i.e., with access to the models, its weights and gradients, e.g. (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Madry et al., 2017; Carlini & Wagner, 2017), and black-box attacks, i.e., only with access to the output of the model, e.g. (Chen et al., 2017; Brendel & Bethge, 2017; Su et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018b; Sarkar et al., 2017; Narodytska & Kasiviswanathan, 2017). White-box attacks utilizing projected gradient ascent to maximize the training loss or surrogate objectives, e.g., (Madry et al., 2017; Carlini & Wagner, 2017), have become state-of-the-art. In contrast, we directly maximize the confidence in any class different from the true class, similar to (Hein et al., 2019), to attack our proposed training procedure. Additionally, momentum (Dong et al., 2018), backtracking and alternative initializations than used in the literature are required for successful attacks against our models.

Many defenses against adversarial attacks have been proposed, e.g. (Yuan et al., 2017; Akhtar & Mian, 2018; Biggio & Roli, 2018), of which some have been shown to be ineffective, e.g., in (Athalye et al., 2018; Athalye & Carlini, 2018). Other methods aiming at certified robustness (Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017; Wong & Kolter, 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018), adversarial training is the standard to achieve robust models. While adversarial training was proposed in different variants (Zantedeschi et al., 2017; Miyato et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2015; Shaham et al., 2018; Sinha et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017; Madry et al., 2017), the formulation by Madry et al. (2017) received considerable attention and has been extended in various ways, e.g., to universal adversarial examples (Shafahi et al., 2018; Pérolat et al., 2018), using a curriculum learning scheme (Cai et al., 2018) or ensembles of networks (Tramér et al., 2017; Grefenstette et al., 2018). Our CCAT differs from regular adversarial training in the imposed distribution over the labels enforced during training on adversarial examples and by the attack objective. These seemingly simple modifications lead to a classifier which can extrapolate its robustness to other attack models.

# 3 CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION OF ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES

Adversarial training, specifically the robust optimization formulation proposed by Madry et al. (2018), has become standard for obtaining neural networks robust against adversarial examples. In fact, adversarial training is among the few approaches that have not been shown to be ineffective. However, it is known to reduce the accuracy significantly, especially on challenging tasks. Similarly, the robustness obtained through adversarial training is argued to generalize poorly to stronger attacks and other threat models. Our goal is to overcome these problems with our proposed confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT).

We consider a classifier  $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^K$  where  $K$  is the number of classes and  $f_k$  denotes the confidence for class  $k$ . We assume that the cross-entropy loss is used during training, even though our approach can be used with other losses as well. Given  $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$  classified correctly as  $y = \operatorname{argmax}_k f_k(x)$ , an adversarial perturbation  $x + \delta$  is defined as a "small" change  $\delta$  such that  $\operatorname{argmax}_k f_k(x + \delta) \neq y$ , i.e., the classifier changes its decision. The strength of the change  $\delta$  is measured by some  $l_p$ -norm with  $p \in \{1, 2, \infty\}$ .  $p = \infty$  is a popular choice in the literature as this leads to the smallest perturbation per feature/pixel.

# 3.1 ROBUST LOSS FORMULATION OF ADVERSARIAL TRAINING

The successful and theoretically elegant robust optimization formulation by Madry et al. (2018) is given as the following min-max problem:

$$
\min  _ {w} \mathbb {E} \left[ \max  _ {\| \delta \| _ {\infty} \leq \epsilon} \mathcal {L} (f (x + \delta ; w), y) \right] \tag {1}
$$

with  $w$  being the classifier's parameters and  $\mathcal{L}$  being the cross-entropy loss. During mini-batch training the inner maximization problem, i.e.,

$$
\max  _ {\| \delta \| _ {\infty} \leq \epsilon} \mathcal {L} (f (x + \delta ; w), y), \tag {2}
$$

is approximately solved. In addition to the  $l_{\infty}$ -constraint, a box constraint, i.e.,  $\tilde{x}_i = (x + \delta)_i \in [0,1]$ , is enforced for images. Note that for the cross-entropy loss, Eq. (2) is equivalent to finding the point  $x + \delta$  with minimal confidence in the true class  $y$ . Finally, for neural networks, we note that Eq. (2) is a non-convex optimization problem. In (Madry et al., 2018) the problem is tackled using projected gradient descent (PGD), which is typically initialized using a random  $\delta$  with  $\| \delta \|_{\infty} \leq \epsilon$ . At test time one uses the best out of several random restarts of Eq. (2) to assess robustness.

In contrast to adversarial training as proposed in (Madry et al., 2018), which computes adversarial examples for the full mini-batch, others compute adversarial examples only for  $50\%$  of the minibatch, e.g. (Szegedy et al., 2013). Compared to Eq. (1), this approach effectively minimizes

$$
\min  _ {w} \left(\mathbb {E} \left[ \max  _ {\| \delta \| _ {\infty} \leq \epsilon} \mathcal {L} (f (x + \delta ; w), y) \right] + \mathbb {E} \left[ \mathcal {L} (f (x; w), Y) \right]\right). \tag {3}
$$

This improves test accuracy on clean examples compared to Eq. (1) but typically leads to worse robustness. Intuitively, this variant already optimizes the mentioned robustness-accuracy trade-off.

There are two problems of adversarial training in Eq. (1). First, the  $\epsilon$ -ball around training examples might include examples from other classes. Then, Eq. (2) will focus on these regions such that adversarial training for these examples gets "stuck". This case is illustrated in our theoretical toy dataset in Sec. 3.3. Here, both  $100\%$  and  $50\%$  adversarial training, cf. Eq. (1) and (3), are not able to find the Bayes optimal classifier in a fully deterministic problem, i.e., zero Bayes error. This might contribute to the observed drop in accuracy for adv. training on datasets such as Cifar10 (Krizhevsky, 2009). Second and most importantly, adversarial training as in Eq. (1) does not give any guidance to the classifier how to extrapolate the classifier beyond the used  $\epsilon$ -ball during training. Even worse, it enforces high confidence predictions everywhere inside the  $\epsilon$ -ball but clearly one cannot extrapolate high-confidence predictions to increasingly larger neighborhoods. Thus, it is not surprising that adversarial examples can often be found right beyond the  $\epsilon$ -ball, i.e., there is no generalization of robustness to stronger attacks of the same type or other threat models, e.g., other  $p$ -norm balls.

# 3.2 CONFIDENCE-CALIBRATED ADVERSARIAL TRAINING

We address both problems of adversarial training: the tension between accuracy and robustness and the poor generalization to larger  $\epsilon$ -balls and other threat models. The required modifications as outlined in Alg. 1 are small but effective. During training, instead of searching for an adversarial

The main changes compared to regular adversarial training as, e.g., described in (Madry et al., 2018) or (Szegedy et al., 2013), are in the attack (line 4) and the probability distribution over the classes (line 6,7), which becomes more uniform as distance  $\| \delta \|_{\infty}$  increases.

Figure 1: Illustration of Confidence Calibration. For adversarial training (AT) and our confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT) with  $\rho_{\mathrm{pow}} = 10$  using the power transition in Eq. (6), both trained with  $\epsilon = 0.03$  on SVHN, we show the probabilities for all ten classes along adversarial directions. Adversarial examples were computed using our  $L_{\infty}$ -PGD-Conf attack. The robustness of AT does not generalize as directly after or in the  $\epsilon$ -ball the classifier attains high confidence in a different class, whereas CCAT predicts close to uniform confidence after some transition phase and thus adversarial samples can be easily distinguished from test examples due to their low confidence.

example  $x + \delta$  that minimizes the confidence in the true label  $y$ , as in Eq. (2), we search for an adversarial example that maximizes the confidence in an arbitrary other label  $k \neq y$ :

$$
\max  _ {\| \delta \| _ {\infty} \leq k \neq y} \max  _ {k \neq y} f _ {k} (x + \delta ; w) \tag {4}
$$

This is motivated by our defense strategy to detect adversarial examples based on their (low) confidence. Thus, a natural adaptive attack against this strategy is maximizing the target confidence, similar to (Goodfellow et al., 2019). During training, CCAT biases the classifier by feeding back adversarial examples into the training process with label distribution shifted to the uniform distribution on adversarial examples, given as:

$$
\hat {p} (k) = \lambda p _ {y} (k) + (1 - \lambda) u (k), \quad k = 1, \dots , K. \tag {5}
$$

Here,  $p_{y}(k)$  is the original "one-hot" distribution, i.e.,  $p_{y}(k) = 1$  iff  $k = y$  and  $p_{y}(k) = 0$  otherwise, and  $u(k) = \frac{1}{K}$  is the uniform distribution. Thus, we enforce a convex combination of the original label distribution and the uniform distribution which is controlled by the parameter  $\lambda$ . We choose  $\lambda$  to decrease with the distance  $\| \delta \|_{\infty}$  of the adversarial example to the attacked example  $x$ . We consider two similar variants of transitions:

$$
\lambda = e ^ {- \rho \| \delta \| _ {\infty}} \quad \text {(“ e x p o n e n t i a l t r a n s i t i o n ” (e x p)} \tag {6}
$$

$$
\lambda = (1 - \min  (1, \| \delta \| _ {\infty} / \epsilon)) ^ {\rho} \quad \left(\text {＂ p o w e r t r a n s i t i o n ＂ (p o w)}\right)
$$

This ensures that for  $\delta = 0$  we impose the original (one-hot) label. For growing  $\delta$ , however, the influence of the original label decays proportional to  $\|\delta\|_{\infty}$ . The speed of decay is controlled by the parameter  $\rho$ . For the exponential transition, we always have a bias towards the true label as even for large  $\rho$ ,  $\lambda$  will be non-zero. In case of the power transition,  $\lambda = 0$  for  $\|\delta\|_{\infty} \geq \epsilon$ , meaning a pure uniform distribution is enforced. We call this procedure confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT). Both transitions used in CCAT guide the classifier to decrease its confidence to uniform when leaving the "data manifold" in an adversarial way – we note that adversarial examples leave the data-manifold (Stutz et al., 2019). In this way the classifier can generalize its robustness to stronger attacks and other threat models as it predicts simply uniform confidence there, see Fig. 1. It is important to note that in CCAT in Alg. 1 we train on  $50\%$  clean and  $50\%$  adversarial examples in each mini-batch. Training only on adversarial examples will not work as we loose signal where the true data manifold lies.

As backtracking needs an additional forward pass per iteration, we compare  $T = 200$  with backtracking to  $T = 300$  without. Attacks on AT succeed within a few iterations, but are more difficult against CCAT and require initialization at zero.

# 3.3 CONFIDENCE-CALIBRATED ADVERSARIAL TRAINING YIELDS ACCURATE MODELS

The following Proposition analyzes  $100\%$  adversarial training, cf., Eq. (1) as proposed by Madry et al. (2018) and its  $50\%$  variant, cf. Eq. (3), and our confidence-calibrated variant:

Proposition 1. We consider a classification problem with two points  $x = 0$  and  $x = \epsilon$  in  $\mathbb{R}$  with deterministic labels, that is  $p(y = 2|x = 0) = 1$  and  $p(y = 1|x = \epsilon) = 1$  and the problem is fully determined by the probability  $p_0 = p(x = 0)$  as  $p(x = \epsilon) = 1 - p_0$ . The Bayes error of this classification problem is zero. The Bayes optimal classifier of

-  $100\%$  adversarial training yields an error of  $\min \{p_0, 1 - p_0\}$ .  
- adversarial training with  $50\%$  adversarial and  $50\%$  clean examples yields an error of  $\min \{p_0, 1 - p_0\}$ .  
- Our confidence-calibrated adversarial training with  $50\%$  clean and  $50\%$  adversarial examples yields zero error if  $\lambda < \min \left\{\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}, \frac{1 - p_0}{p_0}\right\}$ .

This proposition shows a clear advantage of our confidence-calibrated adversarial training over regular adversarial training. It reconfirms that there is indeed a tension between accuracy and robustness when using adversarial training both in the  $100\%$  and the  $50\%$  variants as it has recently been discussed (Tsipras et al., 2018; Stutz et al., 2019). However, our confidence-calibrated adversarial training can resolve this if  $\lambda$  and thus  $\rho$  in Eq. (6) is chosen appropriately.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate our CCAT based on the ability to reject adversarial examples by their confidence and generalize robustness to larger  $\epsilon$ -balls and other threat models. Thus, we use a two-stage approach: first, we decide whether a given (potentially adversarial) example is rejected or classified; second, we evaluate the robustness and accuracy on the non-rejected examples. We present experiments on MNIST, (LeCun et al., 1998) SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011) and Cifar10 (Krizhevsky, 2009).<sup>1</sup>

Attacks: We follow (Madry et al., 2018) and use projected gradient descent (PGD) to minimize the negatives of Eq. (2) and (4); we denote them as PGD-CE and PGD-Conf. The perturbation  $\delta$  is initialized uniformly over direction and distance; for PGD-Conf, we additionally use  $\delta = 0$  as initialization. Different from (Madry et al., 2018), we run exactly  $T$  iterations (no early stopping) and take the perturbation corresponding to the best objective of the  $T$  iterations. In addition to momentum, as in (Dong et al., 2018), we propose to use an adaptive learning rate in combination with a backtracking scheme to improve the attacks: after each iteration, the computed update is only applied if it improves the objective; otherwise the learning rate is reduced. For evaluation, we use  $T = 2000$  iterations, 10 random retries and learning rate of 0.001 for PGD-Conf and  $T = 200$  with 50 random retries and learning rate 0.05 for PGD-CE. As black-box attacks, we additionally use random sampling, the attack by Ilyas et al. (2018a), adapted with momentum and backtracking optimizing Eq. (4) for  $T = 2000$  iterations with 10 attempts, a variant of (Narodytska & Kasiviswanathan,

2017) with  $T = 2000$  iterations and the "cube" attack Andriushchenko (2019) with  $T = 5000$  iterations. The black-box attacks ensure that our defense avoids, e.g., gradient masking as described in (Athalye et al., 2018). In addition to  $L_{\infty}$  attacks, we also consider PGD-CE, PGD-Conf and the cube attack for  $L_{2}$ -attacks. For each model, we attack the first 1000 test examples and evaluate on the per-example worst-case adversarial examples, i.e., the adversarial examples with highest confidence per example but across all attacks and attempts.

Training: We use ResNet-20 (He et al., 2016) on all datasets, implemented in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017). The networks are initialized using (He et al., 2015) and trained using stochastic gradient descent with batch size of 100 for 100 or 200 epochs (MNIST and SVHN/Cifar10, respectively). We use  $T = 40$  iterations,  $\epsilon = 0.3$  on MNIST and  $\epsilon = 0.03$  on SVHN and Cifar10 for the attacks during training - images are normalized to [0, 1]. For CCAT we initialize perturbations uniformly or at zero.

Evaluation Metrics: We evaluate our proposed approach in terms of detection of adversarial examples: successful adversarial examples are considered negatives and correctly classified test examples are considered positives. We report the area under the ROC curve, i.e., ROC AUC. For fair comparison with regular adversarial training (AT), we report both test error (Err) and robust test error (RErr) and also extend these metrics to our detection setting; specifically, we report both Err and RErr for a confidence threshold  $\tau$  resulting in a true positive rate (TPR) of  $99\%$ , i.e., the network is allowed to reject only up to  $1\%$  of correctly classified test examples. Then,  $\mathrm{RErr}(\tau)$  is calculated as:

$$
\operatorname {R E r r} (\tau) = \frac {\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \mathbb {1} _ {f \left(x _ {n}\right) \neq y _ {n}} \mathbb {1} _ {c \left(x _ {n}\right) \geq \tau} + \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \mathbb {1} _ {f \left(x _ {n}\right) = y _ {n}} \mathbb {1} _ {f \left(\tilde {x} _ {n}\right) \neq y _ {n}} \mathbb {1} _ {c \left(\tilde {x} _ {n}\right) \geq \tau}}{\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \mathbb {1} _ {c \left(x _ {n}\right) \geq \tau} + \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \mathbb {1} _ {c \left(x _ {n}\right) <   \tau} \mathbb {1} _ {c \left(\tilde {x} _ {n}\right) \geq \tau} \mathbb {1} _ {f \left(x _ {n}\right) = y _ {n}} \mathbb {1} _ {f \left(\tilde {x} _ {n}\right) \neq y _ {n}}}, \tag {7}
$$

Here,  $\tau$  is the confidence-threshold fixed on the held-out last 1000 test examples,  $\{(x_n,y_n)\}_{n = 1}^N$  are test examples,  $c(x_{n})$  denotes the classifier's confidence on  $x_{n}$ , and  $\tilde{x}_n$  are adversarial examples. The enumerator counts the number of incorrectly classified test examples  $x_{n}$  with  $c(x_{n})\geq \tau$  (first term) and the number of successful adversarial examples  $\tilde{x}_n$  on correctly classified test examples with  $c(\tilde{x}_n)\geq \tau$  (second term). The denominator counts test examples  $x_{n}$  with  $c(x_{n})\geq \tau$  (first term) and the number of successful adversarial examples  $\tilde{x}_n$  with  $c(\tilde{x}_n)\geq \tau$  but where the corresponding test example  $x_{n}$  has  $c(x_{n}) < \tau$  (second term). The latter takes care of the special case where adversarial examples have higher confidence than their corresponding test examples, which is encouraged by the objective of our PGD-Conf attack, see Eq. (4). In total this yields a correct fraction within [0, 1]. For  $\tau = 0$ , Eq. (7) reduces to the "regular" RErr. The confidence-thresholded  $\mathrm{Err}(\tau)$  corresponds to taking only the first terms in both enumerator and denominator. We also note that  $\mathrm{RErr}(\tau)$  naturally subsumes the false positive rate (FPR). RErr is always computed on the 1000 attacked test examples; Err is computed on all test examples (without the held-out part for determining  $\tau @99\% \mathrm{TPR}$ ).

Table 2: Main results on MNIST, SVHN and Cifar10. Comparison of AT and CCAT on MNIST (top), SVHN (middle) and Cifar10 (bottom). We report worst-case results across all tested attacks, for  $L_{\infty}$  and  $L_{2}$  attacks; the used  $\epsilon$  values are reported in the left most column. During training,  $L_{\infty}$  attacks with  $\epsilon = 0.3$  on MNIST and  $\epsilon = 0.03$  on SVHN/Cifar10 were used. In all cases we report "regular" Err and RErr, their confidence-thresholded variants for  $\tau @99\%$ TPR as well as ROC AUC.

# 4.1 ABLATION STUDY

Momentum and Backtracking: Fig. 2 illustrates the advantage of momentum and the proposed backtracking scheme for PGD-Conf with  $T = 40$  iterations on 10 test examples of SVHN. As shown in Fig. 2 and Tab. 1, better objective values can be achieved within fewer iterations and avoiding oscillation which is important at training time. However, also at test time, Tab. 1 shows that attacking our CCAT model effectively requires up to  $T = 2000$  iterations and zero initialization so that RErr for  $\tau @99\%$ TPR stagnates. In contrast, PGD-Conf performs better against AT even for smaller  $T$  and without momentum or backtracking. Thus, finding high-confidence adversarial examples against CCAT is more difficult than for AT. Overall, this illustrates our immense effort put into attacking our proposed defense with an adapted attack, novel optimization techniques together with large number of iterations and black box attacks for avoiding gradient obfuscation. We are sure that our defense cannot be easily broken and thus our reported performance is reliable.

Evaluation Metrics: Fig. 4 shows ROC and RErr curves on SVHN, considering AT and CCAT with  $\rho_{\mathrm{pow}} = 10$ , i.e., using the power transition from Eq. (6). The ROC curves, and the corresponding AUC value, quantify how well (successful) adversarial examples can be distinguished from (correctly classified) test examples. Note our conservative choice to use the confidence threshold  $\tau$  at  $99\%$  TPR ( $\tau$  depends only on correctly classified test examples, not adversarial examples), loosing at most  $1\%$  correctly classified examples. We note that RErr implicitly includes FPR as well as Err; additionally, allowing confidence thresholding will naturally also improve robustness for AT. On SVHN and Cifar10, we found the power transition with  $\rho_{\mathrm{pow}} = 10$  from Eq. (6) to work best. Up to  $\rho = 10$ , performance regarding RErr for  $\tau@99\%$  TPR continuously improves and after  $\rho_{\mathrm{pow}} = 10$  performance stagnates, as shown in detail in the appendix. On MNIST, interestingly, exponential transition with  $\rho_{\mathrm{exp}} = 7$  performs best; we assume that the slight bias towards the true label preserved in the exponential transition helps.

Table 3: Noise and distal adversarial example results on MNIST, SVHN and Cifar10. Robustness against uniform noise (Rand) and distal adversarial examples (Dist), i.e., high-confidence adversarial computed on uniform noise using our  $L_{\infty}$  PGD-Conf attack by considering Eq. (4) without any true label; we use  $\epsilon = 0.3$  on MNIST,  $\epsilon = 0.03$  on SVHN/Cifar10. We report ROC AUC and FPR for a confidence threshold of  $\tau @99\%$ TPR.

# 4.2 RESULTS

In Tab. 2, we report the main results of our paper, namely robustness across all evaluated  $L_{\infty}$  attacks for the same  $\epsilon$  used during training and an increased  $\epsilon$ . As RErr for  $\tau @99\%$  TPR is always lower than its unthresholded variant for  $\tau = 0$ , showing the general advantage of allowing rejection of adversarial examples, we concentrate on the newly introduced thresholded metrics. While on MNIST, CCAT incurs a drop of roughly  $6\%$  in RErr, and on Cifar10 a drop of roughly  $5\%$  against  $L_{\infty}$  with the same  $\epsilon$  as during training, it significantly outperforms AT on SVHN, by more than  $16\%$ . On SVHN and Cifar10, Err is additionally improved - on Cifar10, the improvement is particularly significant with roughly  $6\%$ . For larger  $\epsilon$ , robustness of AT degrades significantly, while CCAT is able to preserve robustness to some extent, especially on SVHN. Only on Cifar10, RErr degrades similarly to AT. In terms of generalization to another threat model, here  $L_{2}$  attacks, CCAT outperforms AT significantly. We note that on all datasets, the considered  $\epsilon$  values of 3 on MNIST and 1 on SVHN/Cifar10 correspond to  $L_{2}$ -balls which are not contained in the  $L_{\infty}$ -ball used during training. Robustness of AT degrades significantly, while CCAT generalizes to this new attack model. Here one can clearly see the effect of better extrapolation properties of CCAT.

As second experiment we report in Tab. 3 results for detecting uniform noise and adversarial uniform noise (i.e., distal adversarial examples) based on their confidence. For the latter, we sample uniform noise and subsequently use PGD-Conf to maximize the confidence (without considering any true label in Eq. (4)) in the  $L_{\infty}$ -ball around the noise point. We use the same hyper-parameters and  $\epsilon$  values as used for PGD-Conf in Tab. 2. Although ROC AUC values are high on uniform noise, an FPR of  $40\%$  or higher shows that AT assigns high confidence to uniform noise. When maximizing confidence on uniform noise, FPR approaches  $100\%$  on all datasets. In contrast CCAT allows to separate these attacks perfectly from test examples. This further supports that CCAT induces a bias beyond the  $\epsilon$ -ball used for training.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We proposed confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT) which addresses two limitations of regular adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018; Szegedy et al., 2013): an apparent accuracy-robustness problem, i.e., adversarial training tends to worsen accuracy; and, more importantly, the lack of "generalizable" robustness, i.e., obtaining robust models against a larger class of adversarial attacks than used during training (e.g., by allowing larger adversarial perturbations or other threat models). CCAT achieves comparable or better robustness against the threat model at training time with better test accuracy on SVHN and Cifar10. However, in strong contrast to adversarial training, CCAT is able to generalize to stronger attacks in  $L_{\infty}$ ,  $L_{2}$ -attacks and reduces confidence on (adversarial) uniform noise as it naturally extrapolates beyond the  $L_{\infty}$ -ball used during training. This opens up new directions of research aiming at models which are robust in a broad sense.
