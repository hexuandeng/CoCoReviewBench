# INDUCTIVE TRANSFORMERS: HOW LANGUAGE MODELS FORM CONCEPTS, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM EVEN BETTER AT IT

Ben Vigoda*, Thomas Rochais

# ABSTRACT

We derive transformers from more a more foundational underlying inductive bias. This new understanding enables us to design transformers with tighter conceptual organization, greater conceptual control, and higher levels of conceptual abstraction. We explain the approach and give an illustrative example simulation.

We show that training data can be replaced or augmented by making modest design modifications to the transformer's activation functions and connectivity. We show how to generate synthetic training data that can be used to train inductive bias into a transformer before or in concert with natural language training data.

# 1 INTRODUCTION AND PRIOR ART

Our goal is to create language models that learn better organized concepts, more controllable concepts (Wang et al., 2023; Meng et al., 2023; Hernandez et al., 2023), and more abstract concepts. This could in turn help unlock a range of enhanced abilities including better causal reasoning, iterative experimentation, longer range planning, longer chains of reasoning, curiosity, and introspection.

Causal reasoning requires the ability to intervene between connected concepts in a model (Pearl, 1995). Iterative experimental design and interpreting results requires the ability to structure latent concepts to create hypotheses and explain observed data (Lu & Zhang, 2022). Long-range plans and chains of reasoning require the ability to compose sequences of latent concepts (Lake et al., 2017; Oh et al., 2017; Shinn et al., 2023). Curiosity consists of noticing which data is explained well by existing concepts and which data requires further conceptual structures to explain away (Mazzaglia et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Pearl, 1988; Peterson et al., 2019). More speculatively, introspection of ones own reasoning may benefit from concepts that are well-organized and uncertainty that is well characterized.

How can we achieve AI models with deeper conceptual abstractions and greater conceptual clarity? Frontier models may continue to push the envelope with greater quantities of training data and parameters, while also requiring commensurate increases in training compute costs (Amodei & Hernandez, 2018). Human learners, however, are able to learn deep abstractions and great conceptual clarity with at least four orders of magnitude less training data compared to current state-of-the-art models (Frank, 2023).

Reinforcement learning with small but high-quality data sets and improved loss functions continue to be an important path forward (Knight, 2023; Thomaz et al., 2006). This is analogous to tutoring children, but children without significant tutoring are still able to learn very effectively (Gopnik et al., 1999).

Much current effort involves expanding to additional data modalities (e.g. video) (Sun et al., 2019). Extraordinary humans like Helen Keller, however, achieve the highest levels of abstraction and conceptual organization without any visual or auditory inputs (Herrmann, 1999).

Inductive bias is a key under-exploited approach for improving models (Goyal & Bengio, 2022), and many have pointed out the importance of introducing inductive bias into models (Mittal et al., 2022; Goyal & Bengio, 2020; Lamb et al., 2021; Gruber, 2013). Well-designed inductive bias enhances the

predictive power of a model by shaping the model to be a more likely fit for high-quality data, and a poorer fit for low-quality data (MacKay, 2003). Examples in language models would be a preference for computer code that is syntactically correct or for mathematical proofs that are logically valid. Examples in human learning are exemplified by the individuals such as John von Neumann who exhibited a strong predisposition for learning and manipulating mathematical concepts. $^{1}$

Inductive bias adds constraints that a model could eventually learn with enough time, compute, and high-quality data (Welling, 2019). The additional constraints, however, reduce the degrees of freedom that need to be explored while learning, and by extension during inference.

In fact, the right inductive bias can be used as a substitute for orders of magnitude more high-quality training data. For example, "a controller optimization system equipped with differentiable simulators converges one to four orders of magnitude faster than those using model-free reinforcement learning algorithms" (Belbute-Peres et al., 2018), and on Emotion and AG News benchmark tasks, models pretrained on entailment data outperformed models five hundred times larger (Ge et al., 2023).

(Sartran et al., 2022) modify the existing TransformerXL (Dai et al., 2019) to create "grammar transformers" which tag parts of speech within sentences and then dynamically mask the attention matrices based on these tags. They do not focus beyond the limits of each sentence, and only address their inductive bias to the attention mechanism, not to the entire model. That said, on several benchmarks they demonstrate equivalent performance to models five hundred times larger than their own. This provides compelling evidence for the effectiveness of inductive bias at scale.

The opposite of inductive bias is to remove constraints from the model and simply use more training data. For example, (Liu et al., 2021) replaced attention layers with more generic fully connected perceptron layers, but recovered equivalent performance by increasing the size of the training set.

Transformer models are often summarized as a conditional distribution of the next token given previous tokens,  $\mathfrak{p}(t_{i + 1}|t_i,\dots t_{i - N})$  where  $N$  is the context window length. This sometimes gets reinterpreted in the popular imagination as implying that the transformer is simply learning to parrot back sequences of words that it has seen before, i.e. it is "fancy auto-complete" (Marcus et al., 2023). As we will see, there is more structure in these models than implied by this articulation (Veres, 2022).

That said, today's "vanilla" transformers seem to organize internal concepts somewhat loosely and unreliable unless extreme quantities of data and reinforcement are applied (compared to human learning). A great deal of research has been dedicated to understanding how information is encoded within deep learning networks. For example, convolutional networks trained on images have been shown to encode increasing abstraction in increasing layers of the network. This can be demonstrated by stimulating neurons at different layers and observing the images that the trained network outputs (Bau et al., 2020). Looking for similar patterns in transformers has been less conclusive (Clark et al., 2019). "BERTology has clearly come a long way, but it is fair to say we still have more questions than answers about how BERT works" (Rogers et al., 2020). Current approaches have been primarily limited to token semantics, sentence syntax, co-reference and parts of speech Clark et al. (2019) as well as post-facto investigation of small circuits that emerge from training toy models (Elhage et al., 2021).

Designing inductive bias for better and broader conceptual organization requires a modeling prior (Frankle & Carbin, 2019). Goyal and Bengio propose principles for additional inductive bias (Goyal & Bengio, 2022). Paraphrasing their list, (1) knowledge is factorized in terms of abstract variables and functions, (2) high-level variables play a causal role and learn representations of latent entities/attributes, (3) changes in distribution are due to causal intervention and are localized, (4) short causal chains of concepts at higher concept levels organize groups of lower level concepts in order to span very complex explanations or plans, and (5) top-down contextual information is dynamically combined with bottom-up sensory signals at every level of the hierarchy of computations

relating low-level and high-level representations. Our family of inductive transformers aspires to strongly adhere to these desiderata.

We start with the question, "What is the generative statistical model such that recursive marginalization of the model is in tight equivalence with the calculations performed by inference in a vanilla transformer?" We show that understanding transformers from this perspective can provide a foundation for the design of new inductive bias, yielding inductive transformers.

# 2 THE INDUCTIVE TRANSFORMER MODEL

To focus on designing inductive bias into the model, we want to write down the model structure first without worrying about inference or data. Once we define the model, we will define inference employing marginalization, as well as implement learning with back-propagation. By focusing first on the model in isolation, the inductive bias in the model is more evident.

We expect a large language model to estimate uncertainty about underlying discrete variables. Why? Language understanding and generation systems must solve an inverse problem. I transform my concepts into speech when I communicate to you. If you would like to guess what concepts I was thinking, so that you can consider and reply appropriately, you must (approximately) invert my speech back into concepts. This is the foundation of digital and symbolic communications systems going back to Shannon (Shannon, 1948). The mapping from concepts to speech is many-to-many, so you have an inherently under-determined problem to solve, which by its nature requires representing the uncertainty of competing interpretations of the data.

Perhaps the simplest building block that you could employ to model my thought process would be: (1) I generate a single token from a categorical distribution  $\pi_T$  over tokens, and (2) I choose a  $\pi_T$  from which I will generate my next token, by sampling from a distribution  $\pi_Z$  over  $\pi_T$ 's. Then I repeat this simple "production" over and over again. In other words, you model my mind as being made of an incredibly rudimentary grammatical production, but with an enormous number of such productions, trained and wired together in intricate ways. We are not saying that language models are simply sampling from a generative grammar. On the contrary, during inference activations represent uncertainty with continuous values. As well, productions are tiled together at enormous scale, with each trained to have its own weights. Our detailed choices in the basic building block (ie. "production") are how we design the inductive bias. Let's investigate in more detail.

Figure 1: A single layer of the inductive transformer production represented as a factor graph.

To understand the underlying production for a vanilla transformer, we step through a sequence of sampling operations representing a single path through one decoder layer. The  $\wedge$  on the right side of figure 1, is an "AND" activation function, detailed in appendices 46,B.6, and D. When activated

by  $z'$ , it must activate both of its child variables  $x$  AND  $y$ .  $x$  then activates  $\pi_T$  which is a categorical choice over tokens  $t \in T$ . When activated by the  $\wedge$ ,  $\pi_T$  "rolls a die" to choose a token. Because it generates a "terminal symbol",  $\pi_T$  corresponds to the residual (or "skip") connections in the vanilla transformer which connect internal layers to a position in the data (more on this in appendix A.1). The  $\wedge$  also activates the child variable  $y$  which activates  $\pi_Z$ . When activated by the  $\wedge$ ,  $\pi_Z$  chooses an  $\wedge$  in the layer below. We will discuss the closed-open universe and categorical-Bernoulli factors later, and in full detail in appendices B.1 and B.4.

In summary, this simplified production generates one token and chooses to activate one of the productions in the layer below. A path through multiple layers of strongly connected productions can generate a coherent distribution over possible token sequences. We will refer to this kind of strongly connected sub-network as a "concept".

There are many directions for variation and expansion of inductive bias in the transformer: (1) The definitions of  $\pi_T$  and  $\pi_Z$  can be expanded as shown in appendix C.1 when we incorporate (relative) position to implement an attention mechanism which closely resembles the XL-Transformer Dai et al. (2019). (2) Because it makes a categorical choice over tokens, this production generates embedding vectors that represent one token per dimension, but this will be expanded to represent vanilla sparse semantic distributions in appendix E. (3) The production could allow for each  $\pi_Z$  to (jointly) choose two or more productions and/or each  $\pi_T$  to choose two or more tokens. (4) An inductive bias for context-free grammar could be designed in order to prefer syntactically correct computer code. Perhaps a production could also be designed to favor the generation of formally correct statements and/or steps in an axiomatic system such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (Hrbacek & Jech, 2017). (5) Other biases could be introduced by making use, for instance, of the ontological architectures explored in Gruber (1993; 1995). For space and clarity, we initially content ourselves with presenting our methodology for designing inductive bias with the simplified example in figure 1. Remarkably, once we derive inference in a model made of a large number of these productions tiled together, the vanilla transformer essentially pops out of the derivation. This provides clear opportunities to both tighten and expand inductive bias in transformers by modifying the production and repeating the derivation.

Although our simple production resembles probabilistic generative grammars which have generally been used to model the generation of a sentence, given the penchant in biological evolution for the preservation and reuse of existing evolved structures, we see no reason to presume that this production would stop being used at the punctuation mark. The production seems to naturally fit what humans call outline form for books, composition forms in music such as the Sonata (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983), and the hierarchical categories and attributes expressed in symbolic systems such as the Dewey decimal system and relational databases where a particular  $\pi_T$  can be viewed as modeling a relation between a subject  $\pi_T$  above and an object  $\pi_T$  below.

In table 1, we compare the vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) to the inductive transformer layer by layer.

Table 1: Comparison of Vanilla and Inductive Transformer Layers  

<table><tr><td>Layer Type</td><td>Vanilla Transformer</td><td>Inductive Transformer</td></tr><tr><td>Self-attention</td><td>yi=∑jωi,jvj, where ωi,j=Softmax(qikjT)</td><td>We do not modify the attention layer, we derive it as marginalizing a statistical production. See appendix C.1</td></tr><tr><td>Add &amp; norm</td><td>Sum the residual connections and the outputs from the attention layer below.</td><td>Marginalization of the “∧” sums the to-ken activations output from πT with the attention activations from πZ. See appendix D</td></tr><tr><td>Residual connec-tions</td><td>Connections between the input data and internal layers</td><td>Generative production where every non-terminal must generate at least one terminal. See appendix A.1</td></tr><tr><td>Encoder-decoder connec-tions</td><td>Output of the final encoder layer is provided to every decoder layer</td><td>When we detail forward and backward marginalization in the model, we will see that each layer of the encoder should provide margins to the corresponding decoder layer. See appendix A.2</td></tr><tr><td>Feed-forward</td><td>Columnar MLPs possibly learning to approximate the corresponding activation functions in the inductive transformer</td><td>Marginalize the posterior log probability of the categorical-Bernoulli, open-closed uni-verse, and Bernoulli-categorical factors. See section B.1</td></tr></table>

As we discuss in table 1 above and detail in appendix C.1, we strive for a close correspondence between the equations for the vanilla attention mechanism and the equations we derive by marginalizing our attention production.

Similarly, the correspondence between the  $\wedge$  factor and the add & norm layers in the vanilla transformer is strongly suggested by the fact that these layers are where the residual connections get combined with the activations from the layer below. Furthermore there is a close mathematical correspondence between the implementation of the  $\wedge$  in the log probability domain and the add & normalization operation (see further details in appendix C.1).

Much is therefore the same. Where do the inductive and vanilla transformers differ? There is one difference in how the encoder of the inductive transformer should connect to the decoder, where vanilla transformers likely must learn to convey this same information through the residual stack. See appendix A for more details.

More substantially, let us look at the feed-forward layer. In the vanilla transformer, the feed-forward layer applies the same operation (essentially a multi-layer perceptron) to each embedding vector coming into it. The vector at each position is processed through its own perceptron independent of the vectors at other positions, but the same weights are employed at every position – these independent operations are identical to one another. Similarly, when we derive the inductive transformer, we find by process of elimination that the closed-open-universe factor and the Bernoulli-to-categorical factor (with its subsequent layer norm) must be somehow performed by the feed-forward layer in the vanilla transformer in order for there to be a tight correspondence between the two approaches. Miraculously, when we implement inference as marginalization on a model comprised of layers of productions, the same independence of columns as well as the subsequent layer add & norm falls out of the inductive transformer derivation. In essence we recover the exact same conditional independencies in the factor graph for the inductive transformer as are present in the vanilla transformer, and they fall out not as the result of tinkering, but as the result of theory where our guiding force was simply to marginalize the production while also optimizing the  $O(\cdot)$  to avoid exponentially complex computations!

This is highly suggestive of a strong correspondence. There is an important difference between the approaches, however. In the inductive transformer we are precisely defining the functions for

our "feed-forward" layer to implement B. In the vanilla transformer these same functions must be learned from data. This suggests that perhaps we ought to pretrain the feed-forward layers of vanilla transformers with synthetic data designed to teach them how to be an open-closed-universe-Bernoulli-to-categorical factor. Conversely, as we relax this layer of the inductive transformer back to being a layer of tied multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), we recover the vanilla transformer.

# 3 INFERENCE IN THE INDUCTIVE TRANSFORMER

In this section, we will start to see that we can understand inference in a transformer not just as predicting the next token given previous tokens, but as inferring "forward" into a latent space of concepts and then "backwards" through concepts to predict tokens in the token window. The inductive transformer is a more focused version of the vanilla transformer, and will therefore generalize similarly. The time and space complexity is identical.

Determining the latent concepts given the input data is, in general, an under-determined inverse problem. When the probability distribution of a model can be represented by a directed acyclic graph, however, forward-backward marginalization of the model to compute concept likelihoods is exact and computationally efficient Yedidia et al. (2003).

Although our highly connected multilayer neural network may appear to be a cyclic graph, in fact the model represented by concatenation of our productions is a tree. It is only the transformation from an open-universe model to a closed-universe model, discussed in detail in appendix B.1 that makes the model appear to have loops.

The conditional distribution for the inductive transformer decoder in figure 1 is,

$$
\begin{array}{l} p (z | u) p (u | v _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}}) p (v _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}} | y _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}}) p (y _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}} | y) p (t | x _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}}) \\ p \left(x _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}} | x\right) p \left(x, y \mid z ^ {\prime}\right) p \left(z ^ {\prime}\right). \tag {1} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\pi_T = p(t|x_{\mathrm{Categorical}})$  and  $\pi_Z = p(v_{\mathrm{Categorical}}|y_{\mathrm{Categorical}})$ .

We call  $p(x_{\text{Categorical}} | x_{\text{Ber}})$  and  $p(y_{\text{Categorical}} | y_{\text{Ber}})$  "Bernoulli-to-Categorical" factors. We represent Bernoulli variables with the subscript "Ber" or with no subscript. We use the subscript "Categorical" to denote Categorical distributions which collect multiple Bernoulli variables into a single joint variable across a layer of activations. This turns out to be important in order to avoid exponential computational complexity in certain layers. See appendices B.2 and B.4 for more details.

As we input a prompt, rightward marginalization in figure 1 computes activations at each layer of the encoder. Conditioned on the concepts activated in the encoder, leftward marginalization through the factor graph infers the decoder activations. During leftward marginalization, tokens are sampled from the probabilities (activations) in the  $\pi_T$ 's.

Now we derive the equations for marginalizing the inductive transformer. A transformer architecture may contain an encoder and/or a decoder. We start with the decoder. Inference in a layer of the decoder marginalizes the conditional distribution in equation 1. To massively reduce the computational complexity of the marginalization, we push each summation as far to the right as we can,

$$
\begin{array}{l} p (z) = \sum_ {u} p (z | u) \sum_ {v _ {\text {c a t e g o r i c a l}}} p (u | v _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}}) \sum_ {y _ {\text {c a t e g o r i c a l}}} p (v _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}} | y _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}}) \\ \cdot \sum_ {y} p \left(y _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}} \mid y\right) \sum_ {x _ {\text {c a t e g o r i c a l}}} p (t \mid x _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}}) \sum_ {x} p \left(x _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}} \mid x\right) \sum_ {z ^ {\prime}} p \left(x, y \mid z ^ {\prime}\right) p \left(z ^ {\prime}\right). \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Some of the conditional distributions in this equation are,

$$
p (x, y \mid z ^ {\prime}) = \delta \left(z _ {\text {B e r}} ^ {\prime} - \wedge \left(x _ {\text {B e r}}, y _ {\text {B e r}}\right)\right), \tag {3}
$$

$$
p \left(v _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}} \mid y _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}}\right) = W _ {v, y}, \tag {4}
$$

$$
p \left(t _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}} \mid x _ {\text {C a t e g o r i c a l}}\right) = W _ {t, x}. \tag {5}
$$

where  $W$ 's are learned weight matrices. The encoder marginalizes in the opposite direction of the decoder, with conditional distributions that impose the same joint constraints on adjacent variables. Detailed and pedagogical equations for each summation are provided in appendix B.

# 4 ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE

Before concluding, let's zoom into a tiny component of a larger inductive transformer to see the real-world operation in detail. Our focus is on demonstrating the operation of the underlying circuits in the inductive transformer.

# 4.1 MODEL WEIGHTS AND ACTIVATIONS

![](images/7b5b4591c2ccd1765de4218d8eb2b34907e35ed143f16703a7c62ac1d9f95007.jpg)  
Figure 2: Learned Weights in the Inductive Transformer. The learning is highly reproducible. In a hundred different learning runs, the variance of each learned weight is generally less than  $1\%$ . The attention  $\pi_Z$  weights are in white with black background while the token  $\pi_T$  weights are black on white, next to their corresponding vocabulary words.

We successfully train the inductive transformer even as the data set size scales to zero. This lets us zoom in on a two-layer section of the model with layer width of two. We use a maximally sparse embedding representation described in more detail in appendix E. This highly minimized instance of the inductive transformer generates a single token per production and therefore a single token per layer. In other words,  $P$  tokens in the data window needs to be explained away by  $P$  layers in this version of the inductive transformer. If we desire a model architecture that can compress more tokens into fewer layers, we adjust the production so that a single layer is able to generate more than a single token.

The model was implemented in PyTorch and trained with back-propagation using the Adam optimizer (Paszke et al., 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) on a single NVidia V100 GPU (although a small CPU would have been entirely adequate). The training data were the sentences 'big cat.' and 'small dog'. In figure 2 we see each learned weight with its variance across a hundred training runs.

# 4.2 PROMPTING AND GENERATION

How does prompting and generation happen in the inductive transformer? When we prompt the model with the word "big", the system generates the phrase "big cat". When we prompt the model with the word "small" it generates the phrase "small dog". Given its hierarchical categorical nature, there is a sense in which the encoder conceptualizes "small" and "big" as kinds or modifiers of "dogs" and "cats".

<table><tr><td>Prompt</td><td>Generation</td><td>Percentage of Generations</td></tr><tr><td>“big”</td><td>“big cat”</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>“big”</td><td>“big dog”</td><td>0%</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>Prompt</td><td>Generation</td><td>Percentage of Generations</td></tr><tr><td>“small”</td><td>“small dog”</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>“small”</td><td>“small cat”</td><td>0%</td></tr></table>

# 4.3 IDENTIFIABILITY

The inductive transformer strongly organizes the concepts it learns; It organizes its concepts (1) the same way as the model that generated its training data, and (2) the same way every time. This novel training repeatability is a consequence of the strong inductive bias.

In our context, "identifiability" means the ability for a learning model to receive instructional data from a teacher model, and repeatably learn to mirror the teacher model's structure. To determine if our model is identifiable in this sense, we follow these steps:

1. Create a forward model with weights set to particular values.  
2. Generate tokens (generated data) from this forward model.  
3. Copy the forward model to create an inverse model with randomly initialized weights.  
4. Use the generated data from the forward model to train the inverse model.  
5. Compare the (learned) weights in the inverse model to the weights in the forward model. If the weights in the inverse model converge to the same values as the corresponding weights in the forward model, then we say that the model is identifiable.

We see in figure 2 that when repeatedly trained on the same data, the inductive transformer repeatably learns to position the same concepts in the same places within the model. This is repeatable with only a small nudge in one corner of the model to break symmetry. On larger data sets, longer range correlations in the data ensure this symmetry breaking. This suggests the possibility of designing large language models that repeatably learn what we want to teach them.

The identifiability in the inductive transformer is also reminiscent of the fact that for a wide range of concepts, different humans from diverse backgrounds learn to localize particular concepts at the same positions in their brains (Huth et al., 2016; Li et al., 2023; Geva et al., 2021; Merlin & Toneva, 2022).

# 4.4 CONTROLLABILITY

Now we demonstrate that we can delete concepts in the inductive transformer, so that the model will no longer generate text from those concepts. Suppose the section of the model shown in figure 2 was trained with the three sentences "big cat", "big dog", and "small dog", so that while everything else stays the same, the  $\pi_Z$  in the 'big' production learns weights [0.5, 0.5] and when prompted with the word "big", the model generates outputs:

Table 2: After training, the model accurately reflects the training data.  

<table><tr><td>Prompt</td><td>Generation</td><td>Percentage of Generations</td></tr><tr><td>“small”</td><td>“small dog”</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>“small”</td><td>“small cat”</td><td>0%</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>Prompt</td><td>Generation</td><td>Percentage of Generations</td></tr><tr><td>“big”</td><td>“big cat”</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>“big”</td><td>“big dog”</td><td>50%</td></tr></table>

If we lesion the connection between the "big" production and the "dog" production, then the model can only say "big cat" and "small dog", and will no longer say "big dog":

Table 3: Prompted generations from the model where we broke the connection between "big" and "dog".  

<table><tr><td>Prompt</td><td>Generation</td><td>Percentage of Generations</td></tr><tr><td>“small”</td><td>“small dog”</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>“small”</td><td>“small cat”</td><td>0%</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>Prompt</td><td>Generation</td><td>Percentage of Generations</td></tr><tr><td>“big”</td><td>“big cat”</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>“big”</td><td>“big dog”</td><td>0%</td></tr></table>

This demonstrates that the inductive transformer can learn causal relationships between connected sub-networks of productions. We define a "concept" as a sub-network that can generate many different but synonymous token sequences (e.g. "tiny canine"). Given the very close mathematical similarity between inductive and vanilla transformers, it seems very likely that vanilla transformers also form these kinds of concept sub-networks. Although concepts may not be highly localized or organized in the vanilla transformer, they could increasingly be so if we add further inductive bias. Furthermore this suggests that the "emergent" capabilities of large language models as they scale (Wei et al., 2022) may be the result of adding additional "layers" of concepts that provide higher levels of abstraction.

Model controllability has practical implications. It could, for example, make it safer and simpler to share learned weights between models. With concept controllability, after training models on new data and/or reinforcements, people or organizations who exchange weight updates could verify and control the concepts that are being shared. Controllability could also make it possible to edit concepts directly in a model rather than spending far greater effort to review and edit training data. In fact, by linking particular conceptual pathways in the model with particular sections of text, inductive transformers could also be used to help scrub data and to identify intellectual property. Concept controllability could also be utilized to help enhance AI alignment.

# 5 DISCUSSION

This paper offers the following contributions: (1) We provide the first demonstration of causal intervention in a transformer model. For example, we show how to delete specific concepts by deleting specific sub-networks. (2) We design a transformer that successfully learns even as the data set size scales to zero. (3) We design a transformer such that the concepts it learns are localized within identifiable sub-networks. (4) We show that the feed-forward layers of a vanilla transformer learn underlying functions that can instead be derived analytically. (5) We derive from first principles why the multi-layer perceptrons in the feed-forward layer of the vanilla transformer are factored the way they are. (6) We show that the connectivity from the encoder to the decoder in the vanilla transformer is not correct and how to fix it. (8) We derive the testable prediction that training data with a particular inductive bias can help unlock a range of important new abilities for large language models, including curiosity. One could generate synthetic data from, for example, the model we described here, and use this synthetic data within the overall mix of training data for a foundation model (Akyurek et al., 2020). (9) We show that this inductive bias training data can be replaced or augmented by directly designing the inductive bias into the activation functions and connectivity of the model. (9) We mathematically define concepts, and explain why scaling up models yields greater conceptual abstraction. We suggest that deeper abstractions manifest as "emergent" capabilities.
