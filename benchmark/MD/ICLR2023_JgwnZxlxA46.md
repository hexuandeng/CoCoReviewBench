# ON GRADIENT DESCENT CONVERGENCE BEYOND THE EDGE OF STABILITY

Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review

# ABSTRACT

Gradient Descent (GD) is a powerful workhorse of modern machine learning thanks to its scalability and efficiency in high-dimensional spaces. Its ability to find local minimisers is only guaranteed for losses with Lipschitz gradients, where it can be seen as a 'bona-fide' discretisation of an underlying gradient flow. Yet, many ML setups involving overparametrised models do not fall into this problem class, which has motivated research beyond the so-called "Edge of Stability" (EoS), where the step-size crosses the admissibility threshold inversely proportional to the Lipschitz constant above. Perhaps surprisingly, GD has been empirically observed to still converge regardless of local instability and oscillatory behavior.

The incipient theoretical analysis of this phenomena has mainly focused in the overparametrised regime, where the effect of choosing a large learning rate may be associated to a 'Sharpness-Minimisation' implicit regularisation within the manifold of minimisers, under appropriate asymptotic limits. In contrast, in this work we directly examine the conditions for such unstable convergence, focusing on simple, yet representative, learning problems. Specifically, we characterize a local condition involving third-order derivatives that stabilizes oscillations of GD above the EoS, and leverage such property in a teacher-student setting, under population loss. Finally, focusing on Matrix Factorization, we establish a non-asymptotic 'Local Implicit Bias' of GD above the EoS, whereby quasi-symmetric initializations converge to symmetric solutions — where sharpness is minimum amongst all minimisers.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Given a differentiable objective function  $f(\theta)$ , where  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$  is a high-dimensional parameter vector, the most basic and widely used optimization method is gradient descent (GD), defined as

$$
\theta^ {(t + 1)} = \theta^ {(t)} - \eta \nabla_ {\theta} f (\theta^ {(t)}), \tag {1}
$$

where  $\eta$  is the learning rate. For all its widespread application across many different ML setups, a basic question remains: what are the convergence guarantees (even to a local minimiser) under typical objective functions, and how they depend on the (only) hyperparameter  $\eta$ ? In the modern context of large-scale ML applications, an additional key question is not only to understand whether or not GD converges to minimisers, but to which ones, since overparametrisation defines a whole manifold of global minimisers, all potentially enjoying drastically different generalisation performance.

The sensible regime to start the analysis is  $\eta \rightarrow 0$ , where GD inherits the local convergence properties of the Gradient Flow ODE via standard arguments from numerical integration. However, in the early phase of training, a large learning rate has been observed to result in better generalization (LeCun et al., 2012; Bjorck et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019; Jastrzebski et al., 2021), where the extent of "large" is measured by comparing the learning rate  $\eta$  and the curvature of the loss landscape, measured with  $\lambda(\theta) \coloneqq \lambda_{\max}[\nabla_\theta^2 f(\theta)]$ , the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian with respect to learnable parameters. Although one requires  $\sup_\theta \lambda(\theta) < 2/\eta$  to guarantee the convergence of GD (Bottou et al., 2018) to (local) minimisers<sup>1</sup>, the work of (Cohen et al., 2020) noticed a remarkable phenomena in the context

of neural network training: even in problems where  $\lambda (\theta)$  is unbounded (as in NNs), for a fixed  $\eta$ , the curvature  $\lambda (\theta^{(t)})$  increases along the training trajectory (1), bringing  $\lambda (\theta^{(t)})\geq 2 / \eta$  (Cohen et al., 2020). After that, a surprising phenomena is that  $\lambda (\theta^{(t)})$  stably hovers above  $2 / \eta$  and the neural network still eventually achieves a decreasing training loss — the so-called "Edge of Stability". We would like to understand and analyse the conditions of such convergence with a large learning rate under a variety models that capture such observed empirical behavior.

Recently, some works have built connections between EoS and implicit bias (Arora et al., 2022; Lyu et al., 2022; Damian et al., 2021) in the context of large, overparametrised models such as neural networks. In this setting, GD is expected to converge to a manifold of minimisers, and the question is to what extent a large learning rate 'favors' solutions with small curvature. In essence, these works show that under certain structural assumptions, GD is asymptotically tracking a continuous sharpness-reduction flow, in the limit of small learning rates. Compared with these, we study non-asymptotic properties of GD beyond EoS, by focusing on certain learning problems (e.g., single-neuron ReLU networks and matrix factorization). In particular, we characterize a range of learning rates  $\eta$  above the EoS such that GD dynamics hover around minimisers. Moreover, in the matrix factorization setup, where minimisers form a manifold with varying local curvature, our results give a non-asymptotic analogue of the 'Sharpness-Minimisation' arguments from Arora et al. (2022); Lyu et al. (2022).

The straightforward starting point for the local convergence analysis is via Taylor approximations of the loss function. However, in a quadratic Taylor expansion, gradient descent diverges once  $\lambda (\theta) > 2 / \eta$  (Cohen et al., 2020), indicating that a higher order Taylor approximation is required. By considering a 1-D function with local minima  $\theta^{*}$  of curvature  $\lambda^{*} = \lambda (\theta^{*})$ , we show that it is possible to stably oscillate around the minima with  $\eta$  slightly above the threshold  $2 / \lambda^{*}$ , provided its high order derivative satisfies mild conditions as in Theorem 1. A typical example of such functions is  $f(x) = \frac{1}{4} (x^2 -\mu)^2$  with  $\mu >0$ . Furthermore, we prove that it converges to an orbit of period 2 from a more global initialization rather than the analysis of high-order local approximation.

As it turns out, the analysis of such stable one-dimensional oscillations is sufficiently intrinsic to become useful in higher-dimensional problems. First, we leverage the analysis to a two-layer single-neuron ReLU network, where the task is to learn a teacher neuron with data on a uniform high-dimensional sphere. We show a convergence result under population loss with GD beyond EoS, where the direction of the teacher neuron can be learnt and the norms of two-layer weights stably oscillate. We then focus on matrix factorization, a canonical non-convex problem whose geometry is characterized by a manifold of minimisers having different local curvature. Our techniques allow us to establish a local, non-asymptotic implicit bias of GD beyond EoS, around certain quasi-symmetric initialization, by which the large learning rate regime 'attracts' the dynamics towards symmetric minimisers — precisely those where the local curvature is minimal.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Implicit regularization. Due to its theoretical closeness to gradient descent with a small learning rate, gradient flow is a common setting to study the training behavior of neural networks. Barrett & Dherin (2020) suggests that gradient descent is closer to gradient flow with an additional term regularizing the norm of gradients. Through analysing the numerical error of Euler's method, Elkabetz & Cohen (2021) provides theoretical guarantees of a small gap depending on the convexity along the training trajectory. Neither of them fits in the case of our interest, because it is hard to track the parametric gap when  $\eta > 1 / \lambda$ . For instance, in a quadratic function, the trajectory jumps between the two sides once  $\eta > 1 / \lambda$ . Damian et al. (2021) shows that SGD with label noise is implicitly subjected to a regularizer penalizing sharp minimizers but the learning rate is constraint strictly below the edge of stability threshold.

Balancing effect. Du et al. (2018) proves that gradient flow automatically preserves the norms' differences between different layers of a deep homogeneous network. (Ye & Du, 2021) shows that gradient descent on matrix factorization with a constant small learning rate still enjoys the auto-balancing property. Also in matrix factorization, Wang et al. (2021) proves that gradient descent with a relatively large learning rate leads to a solution with a more balanced (perhaps not perfectly balanced) solution while the initialization can be in-balanced. In a similar spirit, we extend their finding to a larger learning rate, with which the perfect balance may be achieved in our setting. We

estimate our learning rate is at least  $3 \times$  theirs (Wang et al., 2021). Note that the implication of balancing effect is to get close to a flatter solution in the global minimum manifold, which may help improve generalization in some common arguments in the community.

Edge of stability. Cohen et al. (2020) observes a two-stage process in gradient descent, where the first is loss curvature grows until the sharpness touches the bound  $2 / \eta$ , and the second is the curvature hovers around the bound and training loss still decreases in a macro view regardless of local instability. Gilmer et al. (2021) reports similar observations in stochastic gradient descent and conducts comprehensive experiments of loss sharpness on learning rates, architecture choices and initialization. Lewkowycz et al. (2020) argues that gradient descent would "catapult" into a flatter region if loss landscape around initialization is too sharp.

Some concurrent works (Ahn et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022; Arora et al., 2022) are also theoretically investigating the edge of stability. Ahn et al. (2022) suggests that unstable convergence happens when the loss landscape of neural networks forms a local forward-invariant set near the minima due to some ingredients, such as tanh as the nonlinear activation. Ma et al. (2022) empirically observes a multi-scale structure of loss landscape and, with it as an assumption, shows that gradient descent with different learning rates may stay in different levels. Arora et al. (2022) shows the training provably enters the edge of stability with modified gradient descent or modified loss, and then its associated flow goes to flat regions.

Learning a single neuron. Yehudai & Ohad (2020) studies necessary conditions on both the distribution and activation functions to guarantee a one-layer single student neuron aligning with the teacher neuron under gradient descent, SGD and gradient flow. Vardi et al. (2021) extends the investigation into a neuron with a bias term. Vardi & Shamir (2021) empirically studies the training dynamics of a two-layer single neuron, focusing on its implicit bias. In this work, we present a convergence analysis of a two-layer single-neuron ReLU network trained with population loss in a large learning rate beyond the edge of stability.

# 3 PROBLEM SETUP

We consider a differentiable objective function  $f(\theta)$  with  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , and the GD algorithm from (1).

Definition 1. A differentiable function  $f$  is  $L$ -gradient Lipschitz if

$$
\left\| \nabla f \left(\theta_ {1}\right) - \nabla f \left(\theta_ {2}\right) \right\| \leq L \left\| \theta_ {1} - \theta_ {2} \right\|, \quad \forall \theta_ {1}, \theta_ {2}. \tag {2}
$$

The above definition is equivalent to saying that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by  $L$ , or the local curvature at each point is bounded by  $L$ . Then  $\eta$  needs to be bounded by  $1 / L$  in GD so that it is guaranteed to visit an approximate first-order stationary point (Nesterov, 1998). The perturbed GD requires  $\eta = 1 / L$  to visit an approximate second-order stationary point (Jin et al., 2021), and stochastic variants share similar assumptions (Ghadimi & Lan, 2013; Jin et al., 2021).

However, in practice, such an assumption may be violated, or even impossible to satisfy when  $\| \nabla^2 f \|$  is not uniformly bounded. Cohen et al. (2020) observes that, with learning rate  $\eta$  fixed, the largest eigenvalue  $\lambda_1$  of the loss Hessian of a neural network is below  $2 / \eta$  at initialization, but it grows above the threshold along training. Such a phenomena is more obvious when the network is deeper or narrower. This reveals the non-smooth nature of the loss landscape of neural networks.

Furthermore, another observation from Cohen et al. (2020) is that once  $\lambda_{1} \geq 2 / \eta$ , the training loss starts to perturb sharply. This is not surprising because GD would diverge in a quadratic function with such a large curvature. However, despite of local instability, the training loss still decreases in a longer range of steps, during which the local curvature stays around  $2 / \eta$ . A further phenomena is that, when GD is at the edge of stability, if the learning rate suddenly changes to a smaller value  $\eta_{s} < \eta$ , then the local curvature quickly grows to  $2 / \eta_{s}$  — indicating the ability to 'manipulate' the local curvature by adjusting the learning rate.

Besides the analysis of GD, the local curvature itself has also received a lot of attention. Due to the nature of over-parameterization in modern neural networks, the global minimizers of the objective  $f$  form a manifold of solutions. There have been active directions to understand the implicit bias of GD methods, namely where do they converge to in the manifold, and why some points in the manifold

are more preferable than others. For the former question, it is believed that (stochastic) GD prefers flatter minima (Barrett & Dherin, 2020; Smith et al., 2021; Damian et al., 2021; Ma & Ying, 2021). For the latter, flatter minima brings better generalization (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Li et al., 2018; Keskar et al., 2016; Ma & Ying, 2021; Ding et al., 2022). It would be meaningful if flatter minima could be obtained via GD with a large learning rate.

More specifically, it has been shown that the eigenvalues of the hessian of a deep homogeneous network could be manipulated to infinity via rescaling the weights of each layer (Elkabetz & Cohen, 2021). Fortunately, gradient flow preserves the difference of norms across layers along the training (Du et al., 2018). As a result, a balanced initialization induces balanced convergence, while GD would break this balancing effect due to finite learning rate. However, recently it has been observed that GD with large learning rates enjoys a balancing effect (Wang et al., 2021), where it converges to a (not perfect) balanced result despite of inbalanced initialization.

Motivated by the connections of optimization, loss landscape and generalization, we would like to understand the training behavior of gradient descent with a large learning rate, from low-dimensional to representative models.

# 4 STABLE OSCILLATION ON 1-D FUNCTIONS

We initiate our analysis of the stable oscillation phenomenon in 1-D. Starting from a condition on general 1-D functions, we look into several specific 1-D functions to verify our arguments. Then, focusing on a function in the form of  $f(x) = (x^{2} - \mu)^{2}$ , we present the convergence analysis as a foundation for the following discussions. Furthermore, to shed light on the multi-layer setting, we propose a balancing effect to make a connection to the 1-D analysis, as shown in Appendix A.1.

General 1-D functions. Consider a 1-D function  $f(x)$  with a learnable parameter  $x \in \mathbb{R}$ . The parameter updates following GD with the learning rate  $\eta$  as

$$
x ^ {(t + 1)} := x ^ {(t)} - \eta f ^ {\prime} \left(x ^ {(t)}\right). \tag {3}
$$

Assuming  $f$  is differentiable and all derivatives are bounded, the function value in the next step can be approximated by

$$
f \left(x ^ {(t + 1)}\right) = f \left(x ^ {(t)}\right) - \eta \left[ f ^ {\prime} \left(x ^ {(t)}\right) \right] ^ {2} \left(1 - \frac {\eta}{2} f ^ {\prime \prime} \left(x ^ {(t)}\right)\right) + o \left(\left(x ^ {(t + 1)} - x ^ {(t)}\right) ^ {2}\right). \tag {4}
$$

If  $\eta < 2 / f^{\prime \prime}(x^{(t)})$ , this approximation reveals that the function monotonically decreases for each step of GD, ignoring higher terms. Such an assumption would guarantee the convergence to a global minimum in a convex function. However, our interest is what happens if  $\eta > 2 / f^{\prime \prime}(x)$ . For instance, if  $f$  is a quadratic function, the second-order derivative  $f^{\prime \prime}$  is constant. As a result, once  $\eta > 2 / f^{\prime \prime}$ , GD diverges except when being initialized at the optimum. However, when trained with a large learning rate  $\eta > 2 / f^{\prime \prime}(\bar{x})$ , there is still some hope for a function to stay around a local minima  $\bar{x}$ , as stated in the following theorem.

Theorem 1. Consider a scalar function  $f(x)$  which is locally  $\mathcal{C}^3$  around a local minima  $\bar{x}$ . Assume (i)  $f^{(3)}(\bar{x}) \neq 0$ , (ii)  $\frac{f^{(3)}(\bar{x})}{f''(\bar{x})} = \mathcal{O}(1)$ , (iii)  $3[f^{(3)}]^2 - f''f^{(4)} > 0$  at  $x = \bar{x}$ , and (iv) all higher order derivatives are bounded as  $\mathcal{O}(1)$ . For a starting point near  $\bar{x}$  as  $x_0 = \bar{x} - \epsilon$  such that  $\epsilon \cdot f^{(3)}(\bar{x}) > 0$  and  $\epsilon$  is sufficiently small, then there exists a learning rate  $\eta$  such that  $GD$  starting from  $x_0$  will back to  $x_0$  in two steps, and

$$
\frac {2}{f ^ {\prime \prime} (\bar {x})} <   \eta <   \frac {2}{f ^ {\prime \prime} (\bar {x}) - \epsilon \cdot f ^ {(3)} (\bar {x})}.
$$

The details of proof are presented in the Appendix C. As stated in the Theorem 1, we provide a necessary condition that allows GD to stably oscillate around a local minima. But still we cannot tell whether or not some functions allow it with  $f^{(3)}(\bar{x}) = 0$ . For instance, a quadratic function does not satisfy this condition since  $f^{(3)} = f^{(4)} \equiv 0$  and it diverges when GD is beyond the edge of stability. For  $f(x) = \sin (x)$  around  $\bar{x} = -\frac{\pi}{2}$  where  $f^{(3)}(\bar{x}) = 0$ , it turns out the sine function allows stable oscillation. Therefore, we extend the argument in Theorem 1 to a higher order case in Lemma 1.

Lemma 1. Consider a 1-D differentiable function  $f(x)$  around a local minima  $\bar{x}$ . Assume (i) the lowest order non-zero derivative of  $f$  (except the  $f''$ ) at  $\bar{x}$  is  $f^{(k)}(\bar{x})$ , (ii)  $\frac{f^{(k)}(\bar{x})}{f''(\bar{x})} = \mathcal{O}(1)$ , (iii) all higher order derivatives are bounded, and (iv)  $k \geq 4$ . Then, from a starting point near  $\bar{x}$  as  $x_0 = \bar{x} - \epsilon$  with  $\epsilon > 0$  sufficiently small, and

1. if  $k$  is odd and  $f^{(k + 1)}(\bar{x}) < 0$ , then there exists  $\eta \in \left(\frac{2}{f''},\frac{2}{f'' - f^{(k)}\epsilon^{k - 2}}\right)$  
2. if  $k$  is even and  $f^{(k)}(\bar{x}) < 0$ , then there exists  $\eta \in \left(\frac{2}{f''}, \frac{2}{f'' + f^{(k)}\epsilon^{k - 2}}\right)$

such that:  $GD$  can stably oscillate in a sufficiently small neighborhood of  $\bar{x}$  with  $\eta$ .

With Lemma 1, we can verify the sine function to allow stable oscillation as in Corollary 1, because its lowest order of nonzero derivative (except  $f''$ ) at the local minima is  $f^{(4)}(\bar{x}) < 0$ . Meanwhile, Theorem 1 provides a guarantee that squared-loss on any function  $g$  provably allows stable oscillation once  $g$  satisfies some mild conditions, as stated below.

Lemma 2. Consider a 1-D function  $g(x)$ , and define the loss function  $f$  as  $f(x) = (g(x) - y)^{2}$ . Assuming (i)  $g'$  is not zero when  $g(\bar{x}) = y$ , (ii)  $g'(\bar{x})g^{(3)}(\bar{x}) < 6[g''(\bar{x})]^{2}$ , and (iii) all higher order derivatives are bounded as  $\mathcal{O}(1)$ , then it satisfies the condition in Theorem 1 or Lemma 1 to allow stable oscillation around  $\bar{x}$ .

Proof details of the above lemmas are presented in the Appendix D and E. This setup covers generic non-linear least squares problems. The most significant condition is that the target value shall not be too special. For instance, any value  $y \in (-1, 1)$  works for  $g(x) = \sin(x)$  or  $g(x) = \tanh(x)$ . The proof details for these settings of  $g(x)$  are provided as Corollaries 2, 3 and 4 at the end of Appendix E. Next we are going to present a careful analysis on  $g(x) = x^2$ .

A special 1-D function. Consider  $f(x) = \frac{1}{4} (x^{2} - \mu)^{2}$  with  $\mu > 0$ ,  $f^{(3)}(\sqrt{\mu}) = 6\sqrt{\mu}$ ,  $f''(\sqrt{\mu}) = 2\mu$ . Note that this function is more special to us because it can be viewed as a symmetric scalar factorization problem subjected to the squared loss. Later we will leverage it to gain insights for asymmetric initialization, two-layer single-neuron networks and matrix factorization. Before that, we would like to show where it converges to when  $\eta > \frac{2}{f''(\sqrt{\mu})}$  as follows.

Theorem 2. For  $f(x) = \frac{1}{4} (x^{2} - \mu)^{2}$ , consider  $GD$  with  $\eta = K \cdot \frac{1}{\mu}$  where  $1 < K \leq 1.121$ , and initialized on any point  $0 < x_0 < \sqrt{\mu}$ . Then it converges to an orbit of period 2, except for a measure-zero initialization where it converges to  $\sqrt{\mu}$ . More precisely, the period-2 orbit are the solutions  $x = \delta_{1} \in (0,1)$ ,  $x = \delta_{2} \in (1,2)$  of solving  $\delta$  in

$$
\eta = \frac {1}{\delta^ {2} \left(\sqrt {\frac {\mu}{\delta^ {2}} - \frac {3}{4}} + \frac {1}{2}\right)}. \tag {5}
$$

The details of proof are presented in the Appendix F. As shown above, Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 stand in two different levels: Theorem 1 restricts the discussion in a local view because of Taylor approximation, while Theorem 2 starts from local convergence and then generalizes it into a global view. However, Theorem 1 builds a foundation for Theorem 2 because the latter would degenerate to the former when  $K$  is extremely close to 1.

A natural follow-up question is what implications Theorem 2 brings, because 1-D is far from the practice of neural networks that contain multi-layer structures, nonlinearity and high dimensions. We precisely incorporate two layers and nonlinearity in Section 5, and high dimensions in Section 6.

# 5 ON A TWO-LAYER SINGLE-NEURON HOMOGENEOUS NETWORK

We denote a two-layer single-neuron network as  $f(x; \theta) = v \cdot \sigma(w^\top x)$  where  $v \in \mathbb{R}$ ,  $w \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , the set of trained parameters  $\theta = (v, w^\top) \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ , and the nonlinearity  $\sigma$  is ReLU. We will keep such an order in  $\theta$  to view it as a vector. The input  $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$  is drawn uniformly from a unit sphere  $S^{d-1}$ .

The parameters are trained by GD subjected to  $L_{2}$  population loss, as

$$
\theta_ {t + 1} = \theta_ {t} - \eta \nabla_ {\theta} L (\theta_ {t}), \quad L (\theta_ {t}) = \mathbb {E} _ {x \in \mathcal {S} ^ {d - 1}} \left(f (x; \theta_ {t}) - y\right) ^ {2}.
$$

We generate labels from a single teacher neuron function, as  $y|x = \sigma (\tilde{w}^{\top}x)$ . Hence  $\tilde{w}$  is our target neuron to learn. We denote the angle between  $w$  and  $\tilde{w}$  as  $\alpha \geq 0$ . Note that  $\alpha$  is set as non-negative because the loss function is symmetric w.r.t. the angle. Moreover, the rotational symmetry of the population data distribution results in a loss landscape that only depends on  $w$  through the angle  $\alpha$  and the norm  $\| w\|$ . Indeed, from the definition, we have

$$
\nabla_ {\theta} L = \frac {1}{d} \left[ v \| w \| _ {2} ^ {2} - \frac {\| w \|}{\pi} \big (\sin \alpha + (\pi - \alpha) \cos \alpha \big) \| \tilde {w} \| v ^ {2} w - \frac {v}{\pi} (\pi - \alpha + \frac {1}{2} \sin 2 \alpha) \cdot \tilde {w} - \frac {v}{\pi} (- \frac {1}{2} \cos 2 \alpha + \frac {1}{2}) \| \tilde {w} \| \tilde {w} _ {\perp} \right],
$$

where we denote  $\tilde{w}_{\perp}$  as the unit-length orthogonal residual of  $w$  after projecting onto  $\tilde{w}$  and  $S_{+}^{d - 1}(w)$  is the half-sphere where  $\langle w,x\rangle \geq 0$ . Consider the Hessian

$$
H \triangleq \left[ \begin{array}{c c} \partial_ {v} ^ {2} L & \partial_ {w} \partial_ {v} L \\ \partial_ {v} \partial_ {w} L & \partial_ {w} ^ {2} L \end{array} \right] \stackrel {\text {i f} v w = \tilde {w}} {=} \frac {1}{d} \left[ \begin{array}{c c} \| w \| ^ {2} & v w ^ {\top} \\ v w & v ^ {2} \mathbb {I} \end{array} \right] \in \mathbb {R} ^ {(d + 1) \times (d + 1)}. \tag {6}
$$

Hence, in the global minima manifold where  $vw = \tilde{w}$ , the eigenvalues of the Hessian are  $\lambda_1 = \frac{\|w\|^2 + v^2}{d}$ ,  $\lambda_{2\dots d} = \frac{v^2}{d}$ ,  $\lambda_{d+1} = 0$ . Therefore, the largest eigenvalue  $\lambda_1$  measures the inbalance between the two layers again as  $\lambda_1 = \frac{(\|w\| - v)^2 + 2\|\tilde{w}\|}{d}$  similar to the 2-D case in (14) in Appendix A.1. So we would like to investigate where GD converges if  $\eta > \frac{2}{2\|\tilde{w}\| / d} = d / \|\tilde{w}\|$ . Note that a key difference between the current case and the previous 2-D analysis is that the current one includes a neuron as a vector and a nonlinear ReLU unit.

From the second row of  $\nabla_{\theta}L$ , which is  $\nabla_w L$ , it is clear that updates of  $w$  always stay in the plane spanned by  $\tilde{w}$  and  $w^{(0)}$ . Hence, this problem can be simplified to three variables  $(v, w_x, w_y)$  with the target neuron  $\tilde{w} = [1, 0]$ . The three variables stand for

$$
v ^ {(t)} := v ^ {(t)}, w _ {x} ^ {(t)} := \mathrm {p r o j} _ {\tilde {w}} w ^ {(t)}, w _ {y} ^ {(t)} := \mathrm {p r o j} _ {\tilde {w} _ {\perp}} w ^ {(t)} = \sqrt {\left\| w ^ {(t)} \right\| ^ {2} - (w _ {x} ^ {(t)}) ^ {2}}.
$$

We keep  $w_{y}$  as nonnegative because the loss  $L$  is invariant to its sign and our previous notation  $\alpha \geq 0$  requires a non-negative  $w_{y}$ . Then we present a convergence result as follows.

Theorem 3. In the above setting, consider a teacher neuron  $\tilde{w} = [1,0]$  and set the learning rate  $\eta = Kd$  with  $K\in (1,1.1]$ . Initialize the student as  $\| w^{(0)}\| = v^{(0)}\triangleq \epsilon \in (0,0.10]$  and  $\langle w^{(0)},\tilde{w}\rangle \geq 0$ . Then, for  $t\geq T_1 + 4$ ,  $w_{y}^{(t)}$  decays as

$$
w _ {y} ^ {(t)} <   0. 1 \cdot (1 - 0. 0 3 0 K) ^ {t - T _ {1} - 4}, \quad T _ {1} \leq \left\lceil \log_ {2. 5 6} \frac {1 . 3 5}{\pi \beta^ {2}} \right\rceil , \quad \beta = \left(1 + \frac {1 . 1}{\pi}\right) \epsilon .
$$

Proof sketch The details of proof are presented in the Appendix I. The proof is divided into two stages, depending on whether  $w_{y}$  grows or not. The key is that the sign of  $\Delta w_{y}$  aligns with the sign of

$$
\Delta w _ {y} \propto - v w _ {x} + \frac {1}{\pi} \frac {\frac {w _ {y}}{w _ {x}}}{1 + \left(\frac {w _ {y}}{w _ {x}}\right) ^ {2}}, \tag {7}
$$

where the second term of RHS is bounded in  $[0, \frac{1}{2\pi}]$ . In stage 1 where  $vw_{x}$  is relatively small, we show the growth ratio of  $w_{y}$  is smaller than  $w_{x}$  and  $vw_{x}$ , resulting in an upper bound of number of iterations for  $vw_{x}$  to reach  $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ , so  $\max(w_{y})$  is bounded too. Although the initialization is balanced as  $v^{(0)} = \| w^{(0)}\|$  for simplicity of proof,  $v - w_{x}$  is also bounded at the end of stage 1. From the beginning of stage 2, thanks to the relatively narrow range of  $K$ , we are able to compute the bounds of three variables (including  $v - w_{x}, vw_{x}$  and  $w_{y}$ ) and they turn out to fall into a basin in the parameter space after four iterations. In this basin,  $w_{y}$  decays exponentially with a linear rate of 0.97 at most.

With the guarantee of  $w_{y}$  decaying in the above theorem, the dynamics of the single-neuron ReLU network is getting closer to the 2-D case in Section A.1.

To summarize, the single-neuron model goes through three phases of training dynamics, with a initialization of the angle as  $\frac{\pi}{2}$  at most. First, the angle decreases monotonically but, due to the growth of norms, the absolute deviation  $w_{y}$  still increases. Meanwhile, the imbalance  $v - w_{x}$  stays in a bounded level. Second,  $w_{y}$  starts to decrease and the parameters fall into a basin within four steps. Third, in the basin,  $w_{y}$  decreases exponentially and, after  $w_{y}$  at a reasonable low level, the model approximately follows the dynamic of the 2-D case and the imbalance  $v - w_{x}$  decreases as well, following Theorem 5. The model converges to a period-2 orbit as in the 1-D case in Theorem 2.

# 6 QUASI-SYMMETRIC MATRIX FACTORIZATION: WALKING TOWARDS FLATTEST MINIMA

Consider a matrix factorization problem, parameterized by learnable weights  $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times p}$ ,  $\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$  and the target matrix is  $\mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times q}$ . The loss  $L$  is defined as

$$
L (\mathbf {X}, \mathbf {Y}) = \frac {1}{2} \| \mathbf {X Y} - \mathbf {C} \| _ {F} ^ {2}. \tag {8}
$$

Obviously  $\{\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y}:\mathbf{XY} = \mathbf{C}\}$  forms a minimum manifold. In this context, the question is to describe GD dynamics in terms of a 'descent' phase (i.e., reaching the manifold), followed by a 'hovering' phase, where the dynamics evolve nearby the minimum manifold. Although we prove that the necessary 1-D condition holds around minimum as Theorem 6 (in Appendix A.2), it is more attracting to investigate GD in high dimensions.

The "flatest" points in the manifold of minimisers are in fact given by symmetric matrices, ie points of the form  $(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{X})$  with  $\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^{\top} = \mathbf{C}$ . As it turns out, the local behavior of GD beyond EoS in this symmetric submanifold of minimisers can be explicitly analysed. Indeed, Theorem 7 (in Appendix A.2) shows that the dynamics follows the direction of the leading eigenvector and then stably oscillates with a period-2 analogous to the 1D case in Theorem 2. Note that, although  $\{\mathbf{X}:\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^{\top} = \mathbf{X}_{0}\mathbf{X}_{0}^{\top}\}$  forms a manifold that contains infinite number of minimizers  $^{2}$ , all of them have the same sharpness due to the same leading singular values. So a natural follow-up question is to analyse minimizers with different sharpness.

The simplest setting that contains minimizers of varying-sharpness is to rescale symmetric minimizers, leading to Quasi-symmetric Matrix Factorization. Given a symmetric target  $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{X}_0\mathbf{X}_0^\top$ , assume that we are around the (global) minima  $\mathbf{Y} = \alpha \mathbf{X}_0 + \Delta \mathbf{Y}_0$ ,  $\mathbf{Z} = \frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbf{X}_0 + \Delta \mathbf{Z}_0$  with  $\alpha > 0$  and small deviation  $\| \Delta \mathbf{Y}_0\|$ ,  $\| \Delta \mathbf{Z}_0\| \leq \epsilon$ . Then the EoS-learning rate at  $(\alpha \mathbf{X}_0, \frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbf{X}_0)$  is  $\frac{2}{\sigma_1^2(\alpha^2 + \frac{1}{\alpha^2})}$ , which is largest as  $\frac{1}{\sigma^2}$  at  $\alpha = 1$ . We study the convergence of GD starting from  $\mathbf{Y} = \alpha \mathbf{X}_0 + \Delta \mathbf{Y}_0$ ,  $\mathbf{Z} = \frac{1}{\alpha}\mathbf{X}_0 + \Delta \mathbf{Z}_0$  with learning rate  $\eta = \frac{1}{\sigma_1^2} + \beta$ . The following theorem shows that, although starting nearby a sharper minima, GD still converges to the flattest one.

Theorem 4. Consider the above quasi-symmetric matrix factorization with learning rate  $\eta = \frac{1}{\sigma_1^2} + \beta$ . Assume  $0 < \beta \sigma_1^2 \leq 0.121$ . The initialization is around the minimum, as  $\mathbf{Y} = \alpha \mathbf{X}_0 + \Delta \mathbf{Y}_0$ ,  $\mathbf{Z} = 1 / \alpha \mathbf{X}_0 + \Delta \mathbf{Z}_0$ ,  $\alpha > 0$ , with the deviations satisfying  $u_1^\top \Delta \mathbf{Y}_0 v_1 \neq 0$ ,  $u_1^\top \Delta \mathbf{Z}_0 v_1 \neq 0$  and  $\| \Delta \mathbf{Y}_0 \|, \| \Delta \mathbf{Z}_0 \| \leq \epsilon$ . The second largest singular value  $\sigma_2$  of  $\mathbf{X}_0$  needs to satisfy

$$
\left. \max  \left\{\eta \frac {\sigma_ {1} ^ {2}}{\alpha^ {2}} \left(1 + \alpha^ {4} \frac {\sigma_ {2} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2}}\right), \eta \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \alpha^ {2} \left(1 + \frac {\sigma_ {2} ^ {2}}{\alpha^ {4} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2}}\right) \right\} \leq 2. \right. \tag {9}
$$

Then  $GD$  would converge to a period-2 orbit  $\gamma_{\eta}$  approximately with error in  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ , formally written as

$$
\left(\mathbf {Y} _ {t}, \mathbf {Z} _ {t}\right)\rightarrow \gamma_ {\eta} + \left(\Delta \mathbf {Y}, \Delta \mathbf {Z}\right), \quad \| \Delta \mathbf {Y} \|, \| \Delta \mathbf {Z} \| = \mathcal {O} (\epsilon), \tag {10}
$$

$$
\gamma_ {\eta} = \left\{\left(\mathbf {Y} _ {0} + \left(\rho_ {i} - \alpha\right) \sigma_ {1} u _ {1} v _ {1} ^ {\top}, \mathbf {Z} _ {0} + \left(\rho_ {i} - 1 / \alpha\right) \sigma_ {1} u _ {1} v _ {1} ^ {\top}\right) \right\}, \quad (i = 1, 2) \tag {11}
$$

where  $\rho_{1}\in (1,2),\rho_{2}\in (0,1)$  are the two solutions of solving  $\rho$  in

$$
1 + \beta \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{\rho^ {2} \left(\sqrt {\frac {1}{\rho^ {2}} - \frac {3}{4}} + \frac {1}{2}\right)}. \tag {12}
$$

Proof sketch Details of proof can be found in Appendix J.3, which shares a similar spirit with Theorem 7. The analysis consists of two phases, depending on whether  $\epsilon_{y,t} \triangleq \langle \mathbf{Y} - \mathbf{Y}_0, u_1 v_1^\top \rangle$ ,  $\epsilon_{z,t} \triangleq \langle \mathbf{Z} - \mathbf{Z}_0, u_1 v_1^\top \rangle$  are small or not. In Phase I, all components of  $\mathbf{Y} - \mathbf{Y}_0$  and  $\mathbf{Z} - \mathbf{Z}_0$  are small due to the initialization near minima, but both  $\epsilon_{y,t}$  and  $\epsilon_{z,t}$  are growing exponentially in a rate of  $\eta \sigma_1^2 \alpha^2 + \eta \frac{\sigma_1^2}{\alpha^2} - 1 > 2\eta \sigma_1^2 > 1$ . In Phase II, both  $\epsilon_{y,t}$  and  $\epsilon_{z,t}$  are much larger than other components, as long as other components are still not growing. So the dynamics of them matches GD of 2-D function  $f(y,z) = \frac{1}{2}(yz - 1)^2$  with learning rate  $\eta' = 1 + \beta \sigma_1^2$ . Following Theorem 5, we have  $\epsilon_{y,t}$  and  $\epsilon_{z,t}$  converge to the same values, which degenerates the 2-D problem to 1-D function. Therefore, the proof concludes with 1-D convergence analysis of  $f(x) = \frac{1}{4}(x^2 - 1)^2$  as shown in Theorem 2. Remark. Note that both  $\mathbf{Y}_0 - \alpha \cdot \sigma_1 u_1 v_1^\top$ ,  $\mathbf{Z}_0 - 1 / \alpha \cdot \sigma_1 u_1 v_1^\top$  are residuals of  $\mathbf{Y}_0$ ,  $\mathbf{Z}_0$  with the top singular value eliminated. Then, compared with Theorem 7, we have  $\rho_i$  corresponds to  $\delta_i + 1$ , which means both symmetric and quasi-symmetric cases converge to parameters with the same top singular values and wander around the flattest minima. Also note that, if  $\eta < \frac{1}{\sigma_1^2}$ , we anticipate it still escapes from the sharp minima and converges to a flatter one (not necessarily the flattest). The result could be obtained by tracking GD on  $f(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}(xy - 1)^2$  with  $\eta < 1$  slightly. But the closed form can not be expressed explicitly, because it strongly depends on initialization.

# 7 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we provide numerical experiments to verify our theorems. Additional experiments on 2-D functions, MLP and MNIST can be found in Appendix B.

1-D functions. As discussed in the Section 4, we have  $f(x) = \frac{1}{4} (x^2 - 1)^2$  satisfying the condition in Theorem 1 and  $g(x) = 2\sin(x)$  satisfying Lemma 1, so we estimate that both  $f$  and  $g$  allow stable oscillation around the local minima. It turns out GD stably oscillates around the local minima on both functions, when  $\eta > \frac{2}{f''(\overline{x})}$  slightly, as shown in Figure 1.

Two-layer single-neuron model. As discussed in the Section 5, with a learning rate  $\eta \in (d,1.1d]$ , a single-neuron network  $f(x) = v\cdot \sigma (w^{\top}x)$  is able to align with the direction of the teacher neuron under population loss. We train such a model in empirical loss on 1000 data points uniformly sampled from a sphere  $S^1$ , as shown in Figure 2. The student neuron is initialized orthogonal to the teacher neuron. In the end of training,  $w_{y}$  decays to a small value before the imbalance  $|v - w_{x}|$  decays sharply, which verifies our argument in Section 5. With a small  $w_{y}$ , this nonlinear problem degenerates to a 2-D problem on  $v,w_{x}$ . Then, the balanced property makes it align with the 1-D problem where  $v$  and  $w_{x}$  converge to a period-2 orbit. Note that the small residuals of  $|v - w_{x}|$  and  $w_{y}$  are due to the difference between population loss and empirical loss.

Symmetric and quasi-symmetric matrix factorization. As discussed in the Section 6 and Appendix A.2, with mild assumptions, both symmetric and quasi-symmetric cases stably wanders around the flattest minima. We train GD on a matrix factorization problem with  $\mathbf{X}_0\mathbf{X}_0^\top = \mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{8 \times 8}$ . The learning rate is  $1.02 \times \mathrm{EoS}$  threshold. Following the setting in Section 6, for symmetric case, the training starts near  $\mathbf{X}_0$  and, for quasi-symmetric case, it starts near  $(\alpha \mathbf{X}_0, 1 / \alpha \mathbf{X}_0)$  with  $\alpha = 0.8$ , as shown in Figure 3. Although starting with a re-scaling, the quasi-symmetric case achieves the

same top singular values in  $\mathbf{Y}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}$ , which verifies the balancing effect of 2-D functions in Theorem 5. Then, the top singular values of both cases converge to the same period-2 orbit, supported by Theorem 2, 4 and 7.

# 8 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we investigate gradient descent with a large step size that crosses the threshold of local stability. In the low dimensional setting, we provide conditions on high-order derivatives that allow stable oscillation around local minima. For a two-layer single-neuron ReLU network, we prove its convergence to align with the teacher neuron under population loss. For matrix factorization, we prove that the necessary 1-D condition holds around any minima. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis of GD in symmetric matrix factorization, which converges to a period-2 orbit aligned with the 1-D convergence. Moreover, we generalize the analysis to quasi-symmetric cases where GD walks towards the flattest minimiser although initialized near sharp ones.

While these are encouraging results that contribute to the growing understanding of gradient descent beyond the Edge of Stability, our analysis suffers from important limitations that require further work. An important item for future work is therefore to extend it to general dimensions with nonlinearity, which will enable the analysis of empirical landscapes as well as multiple neurons. Next, the understanding of the implicit bias of GD in the large-learning rate regime won't be complete without integrating the noise, either in the classic SGD sense or in the labels, as done in Damian et al. (2021); Li et al. (2021).
