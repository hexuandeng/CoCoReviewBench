# ABSTRACT

We explain why directly changing the prior can be a surprisingly ineffective mechanism for incorporating inductive biases into variational auto-encoders (VAEs), and introduce a simple and effective alternative approach: Intermediary Latent Space VAEs (InteL-VAEs). InteL-VAEs use an intermediary set of latent variables to control the stochasticity of the encoding process, before mapping these in turn to the latent representation using a parametric function that encapsulates our desired inductive bias(es). This allows us to impose properties like sparsity or clustering on learned representations, and incorporate human knowledge into the generative model. Whereas changing the prior only indirectly encourages behavior through regularizing the encoder, InteL-VAEs are able to directly enforce desired characteristics. Moreover, they bypass the computation and encoder design issues caused by non-Gaussian priors, while allowing for additional flexibility through training of the parametric mapping function. We show that these advantages, in turn, lead to both better generative models and better representations being learned.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

VAEs provide a rich class of deep generative models (DGMs) with many variants (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Burda et al., 2016; Gulrajani et al., 2016; Vahdat & Kautz, 2020). Based on an encoder-decoder structure, VAEs encode datapoints into latent embeddings before decoding them back to data space. By parameterizing the encoder and decoder using expressive neural networks, VAEs provide a powerful basis for learning both generative models and representations.

The standard VAE framework assumes an isotropic Gaussian prior. However, this can cause issues, such as when one desires the learned representations to exhibit some properties of interest, for example sparsity (Tonolini et al., 2020) or clustering (Dilokthanakul et al., 2016), or when the data distribution has very different topological properties from a Gaussian, for example multi-modality (Shi et al., 2020) or group structure (Falorsi et al., 2018). Therefore, a variety of recent works have looked to use non-Gaussian priors (van den Oord et al., 2017; Tomczak & Welling, 2018; Casale et al., 2018; Razavi et al., 2019; Bauer & Mnih, 2019), often with the motivation of adding inductive biases into the model (Davidson et al., 2018b; Mathieu et al., 2019b; Nagano et al., 2019; Skopek et al., 2019).

In this work, we argue that this approach of using non-Gaussian priors can be a problematic, and even ineffective, mechanism for adding inductive biases into VAEs. Firstly, non-Gaussian priors will often necessitate complex encoder models to maintain consistency with the prior's shape and dependency structure (Webb et al., 2018). These will typically no longer permit simple parameterization, substantially complicating both model construction and training, typically deteriorating final performance. Secondly, the latent encodings are still not guaranteed to follow the desired structure: during training the influence of the prior is only as a regularizer on the encoder and this regularization might not be sufficient to induce the desired behavior. Indeed, Mathieu et al. (2019b) find that simply changing the prior is typically insufficient in practice to learn representations with the desired characteristics at a population level, with mismatches occurring between the data distribution and learned model.

To provide an alternative, more effective, approach that does not suffer from these pathologies, we introduce Intermediary Latent Space VAEs (InteL-VAEs), an extension to the standard VAE framework that allows a wide range of powerful inductive biases to be incorporated while maintaining an isotropic Gaussian prior. This is achieved by introducing an intermediary set of latent variables that deal with the stochasticity of the encoding process before incorporating the desired inductive biases via a parametric function that maps these intermediary latents to the latent representation itself, with the decoder taking this final representation as input. See Fig. 3 for an example.

The InteL-VAE framework provides a variety of advantages over direct replacement of the prior. Firstly, it directly enforces our inductive biases on the representations themselves, rather than relying on the regularizing effect of the prior to encourage this implicitly. Secondly, it provides a natural congruence between the generative and representational models via sharing of the mapping function, side-stepping the issues that non-Gaussian priors can cause for the inference model. Finally, it allows for more general and more flexible inductive biases to be incorporated, by removing the need to express them with an explicit density function and allowing for parts of the mapping between latents to be easily learned during training.

To demonstrate the ability of InteL-VAEs, we show how they can be used to incorporate various inductive biases, enforcing latent representations that are, for example, multiply connected, multimodal, sparse, or hierarchical. Experimental results show the superiority of InteL-VAEs compared with baseline methods in both generation and feature quality. For example, we show that InteL-VAEs provide state-of-the-art performance for learning sparse representations in the VAE framework.

To summarize, we a) highlight the need for inductive biases in VAEs and explain why directly changing the prior is a suboptimal means for incorporating them; b) propose IntelL-VAEs as a simple but effective general framework to introduce inductive biases; and c) show that IntelL-VAEs can learn improved generative models and representations over existing baselines on a number of tasks.

# 2 THE NEED FOR INDUCTIVE BIASES IN VAES

Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) are deep stochastic auto-encoders that can be used for learning both deep generative models and low-dimensional representations of complex data. Their key components are an encoder,  $q_{\phi}(z|x)$ , which probabilistically maps from data  $x \in \mathcal{X}$  to latents  $z \in \mathcal{Z}$ ; a decoder,  $p_{\theta}(x|z)$ , which probabilistically maps from latents to data; and a prior,  $p(z)$ , that completes the generative model,  $p(z)p_{\theta}(x|z)$ , and regularizes the encoder during training. The encoder and decoder are parameterized by deep neural networks and are simultaneously trained using a dataset  $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N\}$  and a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, most commonly,

$$
\mathcal {L} (x, \theta , \phi) := \mathbb {E} _ {z \sim q _ {\phi} (z | x)} [ \log p _ {\theta} (x | z) ] - D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(q _ {\phi} (z | x) \| p (z)\right). \tag {1}
$$

Namely, we optimize  $\mathcal{L}(\theta ,\phi)\coloneqq \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mathrm{pdata(x)}}[\mathcal{L}(x,\theta ,\phi)]$ , where  $\mathrm{pdata(x)}$  represents the empirical data distribution. Here the prior is typically fixed to a standard Gaussian, i.e.  $p(z) = \mathcal{N}(z;0,I)$ .

While it is well documented that this standard VAE setup with a 'Gaussian' latent space can be suboptimal (Davidson et al., 2018a; Mathieu et al., 2019b; Tomczak & Welling, 2018; Bauer & Mnih, 2019; Tonolini et al., 2020), there is perhaps less of a unified high-level view on exactly when, why, and how one should change it to incorporate distinct inductive biases. In particular, it is important to note here that the prior does not play the same role as in a conventional Bayesian model: because the latents themselves are somewhat arbitrary and the model is learned in a data-driven manner, it does not encapsulate our initial beliefs in the way one might expect.

We argue that there are two core reasons why inductive biases can be important for VAEs: (a) standard VAEs can fail to encourage, and even prohibit, desired structure in the representations we learn; and (b) standard VAEs do not allow one to impart prior information or desired topological characteristic into the generative model.

Considering the former, one often has some a priori desired characteristics, or constraints, on the representations learned (Bengio et al., 2013). For example, sparse features can be desirable because they can improve data efficiency (Yip & Sussman, 1997), and provide robustness to noise (Wright et al., 2009; Ahmad & Scheinkman, 2019) and attacks (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018). In other settings one might desire clustered (Jiang et al., 2017), disentangled (Ansari & Soh, 2019; Kim & Mnih, 2018; Higgins et al., 2018) or hierarchical representations (Song & Li, 2013; Sønderby et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017). The KL-divergence term in Eq. (1) regularizes the encoding distribution towards the prior and, as a standard Gaussian distribution typically does not exhibit our desired characteristics, this regularization can significantly hinder our ability to learn representations with the desired properties.

Not only can this be problematic at an individual sample level, it can cause even more pronounced issues at the population level: desired structural characteristics of our representations often relate to the pushforward distribution of the data in the latent space,  $q_{\phi}(z) \coloneqq \mathbb{E}_{\mathrm{pdata}(\mathbf{x})}[q_{\phi}(z|x)]$ , which is both difficult to control and only implicitly regularized to the prior (Hoffman & Johnson, 2016).

Inductive biases can also be essential to the generation quality of VAEs: because the generation process of standard VAEs is essentially pushing-forward the Gaussian prior on  $\mathcal{Z}$  to data space  $\mathcal{X}$  by a 'smooth' decoder, there is an underlying inductive bias that standard VAEs prefer sample distributions with similar topology structures to Gaussians. As a result, VAEs can perform poorly when the data manifold exhibits certain different topological properties (Caterini et al., 2020). For example, they can struggle when data is clustered into unconnected com

ponents as shown in Fig. 1, or when data is not simply-connected. This renders learning effective mappings using finite datasets and conventional architectures (potentially prohibitively) difficult. In particular, it can necessitate large Lipschitz constants in the decoder, causing knock-on issues like unstable training and brittle models (Scaman & Virmaux, 2018), as well as posterior collapse (van den Oord et al., 2017; Alemi et al., 2018). In short, the Gaussian prior of a standard VAE can induce fundamental topological differences to the true data distribution (Falorsi et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2020).

# 3 SHORTFALLS OF VAES WITH NON-GAUSSIAN PRIORS

Though directly replacing the Gaussian prior with a different prior sounds like a simple solution, effectively introducing inductive biases can, unfortunately, be more complicated.

Firstly, the only influence of the prior during training is as a regularizer on the encoder through the  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_{\phi}(z|x)\parallel p(z))$  term. This regularization is always competing with the need for effective reconstructions and only has an indirect influence on  $q_{\phi}(z)$ . As such, simply replacing the prior can be an ineffective way of inducing desired structure at the population level (Mathieu et al., 2019b), particularly if  $p(z)$  is a complex distribution that it is difficult to fit (see, e.g., Fig. 2a). Mismatches between  $q_{\phi}(z)$  and  $p(z)$  can also have further deleterious effects on the learned generative model: the

former represents the distribution of the data in latent space during training, while the latter is what is used by the learned generative model, leading to unrepresentative generations if there is mismatch.

Secondly, it can be extremely difficult to construct appropriate encoder mappings and distributions for non-Gaussian priors. While the typical choice of a mean-field Gaussian for the encoder distribution is simple, easy to train, and often effective for Gaussian priors, it is often inappropriate for other choices of prior. For example, in Fig. 2, we consider replacement with a sparse prior. A VAE with a Gaussian encoder struggles to encode points in a manner that even remotely matches the prior. One might suggest replacing the encoder distribution as well, but this has its own issues, most notably that other distributions can be hard to effectively parameterize or train. In particular, the form of the required encoding noise might become heavily spatially variant; in our sparse example, the noise must be elongated in a particular direction depending on where the mean embedding is. If the prior has constraints or topological properties distinct from the data, it can even be difficult to learn a mean encoder mapping that respects these, due to the continuous nature of neural networks. For example, a standard encoder architecture would struggle to match a prior defined on a hypersphere.

# 4 THE INTEL-VAE FRAMEWORK

To solve the issues highlighted in the previous section, and provide a principled and effective method for adding inductive biases to VAEs, we propose Intermediary Latent Space VAEs (InteL-VAEs). The key idea behind InteL-VAEs is to introduce an intermediary set of latent variables  $y \in \mathcal{V}$ , used as a stepping stone in the construction of the representation  $z \in \mathcal{Z}$ . Data is initially encoded in

Figure shows target latent distribution  $p(z)$  (blue), learned variational embeddings  $q_{\phi}(z|x)$  of exemplar data (green), and data pushforward  $q_{\phi}(z)$  (red shadow) for each method. Simply replacing the prior does not help the VAE match prior structure on either a per-sample or population level, whereas IntelL-VAE produces an effective match.

(b) InteL-VAE

Figure 3: Example InteL-VAE with star-like data. We consider the auto-encoding for two example datapoints  $(x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$ , shown in green), which are first stochastically mapped to  $\mathcal{V}$  using a Gaussian encoder. This embedding is then pushed forward to  $\mathcal{Z}$  using the non-stochastic mapping  $g_{\psi}$ , which is a radial mapping to enforce a spherical distribution. Decoding is then done in the standard way from  $\mathcal{Z}$ , with the complexity of the decoder mapping simplified by the induced structural properties of  $\mathcal{Z}$ .

$\mathcal{V}$  using a conventional VAE encoder (e.g. a mean-field Gaussian) before being passed through a non-stochastic mapping  $g_{\psi}:\mathcal{V}\mapsto \mathcal{Z}$  that incorporates our desired inductive biases and which can be trained, if needed, through its parameters  $\psi$ . The prior is defined on  $\mathcal{V}$  and taken to be a standard Gaussian,  $p(y) = \mathcal{N}(y;0,I)$ , while our representations,  $z = g_{\psi}(y)$ , correspond to a pushforward of  $y$ . In principle,  $g_{\psi}$  can be any arbitrary parametric (or fixed) mapping, including non-differentiable or even discontinuous functions. However, to allow for reparameterized gradient estimators (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015), we will restrict ourselves to  $g_{\psi}$  that are sub-differentiable (and thus continuous) with respect to both their inputs and parameters. Note that we can recover a conventional VAE by setting  $g_{\psi}$  to the trivial identity mapping, for which the latent and representation variables are identical, i.e.  $z = y$ .

As shown in Fig. 3, the auto-encoding process is now  $\mathcal{X} \xrightarrow{q_{\phi}} \mathcal{Y} \xrightarrow{g_{\psi}} \mathcal{Z} \xrightarrow{p_{\theta}} \mathcal{X}$ . By first encoding datapoints to  $y$ , rather than  $z$  directly, we can deal with all the encoder and prior stochasticity in this first, well-behaved, latent space, while maintaining  $z$  as our representation and using it for the decoder  $p_{\theta}(x|z)$ . Once trained, our learned generative model corresponds to  $p(y)p_{\theta}(x|z = g_{\psi}(y))$ , such that we can generate samples by firstly drawing from a standard Gaussian to generate a  $y$ , then passing this sample through  $g_{\psi}$  and the decoder in turn. On the other hand, our learned representation of a datapoint  $x$  is given by  $g_{\psi}(\mu_{\phi}(x))$ , where  $\mu_{\phi}: \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathcal{Y}$  is the encoder mean function. $^1$

The mapping  $g_{\psi}$  introduces inductive biases into both the generative model and our representations by imposing a particular form on  $z$ , such as the spherical structure enforced in Fig. 3 (see also Sec. 6). It can be viewed as a shared module between the representation and generative models, ensuring a congruence between the two. This congruence allows us to more directly introduce inductive bias than previous approaches through careful construction of  $g_{\psi}$ , without complicating the process of learning an effective inference network. In particular, because  $\mathcal{V}$  is treated as our latent space for the purposes of training, we sidestep the inference issues that non-Gaussian priors usually cause. Moreover, because all samples must explicitly pass through  $g_{\psi}$  during both training and generation, we can more directly ensure the desired structure is enforced without causing a mismatch in the latent distribution between training and deployment.

# 4.1 TRAINING

As with standard VAEs, training of an IntelL-VAE is done by maximizing a variational lower bound (ELBO) on the log evidence, which we denote  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{Y}}$ . Most simply, by Jensen's inequality, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} \log p _ {\theta , \psi} (x) := \log \left(\mathbb {E} _ {p (y)} [ p _ {\theta} (x | g _ {\psi} (y)) ]\right) = \log \left(\mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} (y | x)} \left[ \frac {p _ {\theta} (x | g _ {\psi} (y)) \mathcal {N} (y ; 0 , I)}{q _ {\phi} (y | x)} \right]\right) \tag {2} \\ \geq \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} (y | x)} [ \log p _ {\theta} (x | g _ {\psi} (y)) ] - D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(q _ {\phi} (y | x) \| \mathcal {N} (y; 0, I)\right) =: \mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {Y}} (x, \theta , \phi , \psi). \\ \end{array}
$$

Note that the regularization is on the Gaussian latent variable  $y$ , but our representation of interest corresponds to  $z = g_{\psi}(y)$ , from which decoding is also performed. Training corresponds to the optimization  $\arg \max_{\theta, \phi, \psi} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathrm{Pdata}(\mathbf{x})}[\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{Y}}(x, \theta, \phi, \psi)]$ , which can be performed using stochastic gradient ascent with reparameterized gradients in the standard manner. Although inductive biases are introduced, the calculation, and optimization, of  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{Y}}$  is thus equivalent to the standard ELBO. In particular, parameterizing  $q_{\phi}(y|x)$  with a Gaussian distribution still yields an analytical  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_{\phi}(y|x) \parallel \mathcal{N}(y;0,I))$  term.

We note that IntelL-VAEs can also be used with variational bounds more generally, rather than just the standard ELBO. During training, we can simply treat  $g_{\psi}$  as if it were part of the decoder and  $y$  as our latent variables. Consequently the approach can be trivially extended to more general variational bounds and VAE setups, such as IWAE (Burda et al., 2016), InfoVAE (Zhao et al., 2019), and SMC-based methods (Le et al., 2018; Naesseth et al., 2018; Maddison et al., 2017).

# 4.2 INTUITIONS

We now provide further insights into InteL-VAEs, starting with the following result.

Theorem 1. Let  $p_{\psi}(z)$  and  $q_{\phi, \psi}(z|x)$  represent the respective pushforward distributions of  $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$  and  $q_{\phi}(y|x)$  induced by the mapping  $g_{\psi}: \mathcal{Y} \mapsto \mathcal{Z}$ . The following holds for all measurable  $g_{\psi}$ :

$$
D _ {K L} \left(q _ {\phi , \psi} (z | x) \| p _ {\psi} (z)\right) \leq D _ {K L} \left(q _ {\phi} (y | x) \| \mathcal {N} (y; 0, I)\right). \tag {3}
$$

If  $g_{\psi}$  is also an invertible function then the above becomes an equality and  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{Y}}$  equals the standard ELBO on the space of  $\mathcal{Z}$  as follows

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathcal {Y}} (x, \theta , \phi , \psi) = \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi , \psi} (z | x)} [ \log p _ {\theta} (x | z) ] - D _ {K L} \left(q _ {\phi , \psi} (z | x) \| p _ {\psi} (z)\right). \tag {4}
$$

Proof. At a high-level, the result follows predominantly from the data processing inequality (Sason, 2019). Informally, further processing of random variables can only bring them "closer" in the space of distributions, leading to Eq. (3). Equality is reached when no information is lost, which occurs when  $g_{\psi}$  is invertible. Coupling this with the fact that the reconstruction terms are identical under the mapping then leads to Eq. (4). See Appendix A for a complete formal proof.

This result shows how we can alternatively think about InteL-VAEs as implicitly defining a conventional VAE with a non-Gaussian prior, but where both this prior,  $p_{\psi}(z)$ , and our encoder distribution,  $q_{\phi,\psi}(z|x)$ , are themselves defined implicitly as pushforwards along  $g_{\psi}$ , which acts as a shared module that instills a natural compatibility between the two. In particular, (3) shows that the divergence in our representation space is never more than that in  $\mathcal{V}$ . As the magnitude of  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_{\phi}(y|x)\parallel \mathcal{N}(y;0,I))$  in an InteL-VAE will remain comparable to the KL divergence in a standard Gaussian prior VAE setup, this, in turn, ensures that  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_{\phi,\psi}(z|x)\parallel p_{\psi}(z))$  does not become overly large. This is in start contrast to the conventional non-Gaussian prior setup, where it can be difficult to avoid  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q_{\phi}(z|x)\parallel p_{\psi}(z))$  exploding without undermining reconstruction (Mathieu et al., 2019b).

To give another perspective, having the stochasticity in the encoder before it is passed through  $g_{\psi}$  ensures that the form of the noise in the embedding is inherently appropriate for the space: the same mapping is used to warp this noise as to define the generative model in the first place. For example, when  $g_{\psi}$  is a sparse mapping, the Gaussian noise in  $q_{\phi}(y|x)$  will be compressed to a sparse subspace by  $g_{\psi}$ , leading to a sparse variational posterior  $q_{\phi,\psi}(z|x)$  as shown in Fig. 2b. In particular,  $q_{\phi}(y|x)$  does not need to learn any complex spatial variations that result from properties of  $\mathcal{Z}$ . In turn, InteL-VAEs further alleviate issues of mismatch between  $p_{\psi}(z)$  and  $q_{\phi,\psi}(z)$ .

Another benefit of InteL-VAEs is that the extracted features are guaranteed to have the desired structure. Take the spherical case for example, all extracted features  $g_{\psi}(\mu_{\phi}(x))$  lie within a small neighborhood of the unit sphere. By comparison, methods based on training loss modifications, such as Mathieu et al. (2019b), often fail to generate features with the targeted properties.

A more subtle advantage is that we do not need to explicitly specify  $p_{\psi}(z)$ . This can be extremely helpful when we want to specify complex inductive biases: designing a non-stochastic mapping is typically much easier than a density function, particularly for complex spaces. Further, this can make it much easier to parameterize and learn aspects of  $p_{\psi}(z)$  in a data-driven manner (see e.g. Sec. 6.3).

# 5 RELATED WORK

Inductive biases There is much prior work on introducing human knowledge to deep learning models by structural design, such as CNNs (LeCun et al., 1989), RNNs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). However, most of these designs are on the sample level, utilizing low-level information such as transformation invariances or internal correlations in each sample. By contrast, InteL-VAEs provide a convenient way to incorporate population level knowledge—information about the global properties of data distributions can be effectively utilized.

Non-Gaussian priors There is an abundance of prior work utilizing non-Gaussian priors to improve the fit and generation capabilities of VAEs, including MoG priors (Dilokthanakul et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2020), sparse priors (Mathieu et al., 2019b; Tonolini et al., 2020; Barello et al., 2018), Gaussian-process priors (Casale et al., 2018) and autoregressive priors (Razavi et al., 2019; van den Oord et al., 2017). However, these methods often require specialized algorithms to train and are primarily applicable only to specific kinds of data. Moreover, as we have explained, changing the prior alone often provides insufficient pressure on its own to induce the desired characteristics. Others have proposed non-Gaussian priors to reduce the prior-posterior gap, such as Vamp-VAE (Tomczak & Welling, 2018) and LARS (Bauer & Mnih, 2019), but these are tangential to our inductive bias aims.

Non-Euclidean latents A related line of work has focused on non-Euclidean latent spaces. For instance Davidson et al. (2018a) leveraged a von Mises-Fisher distribution on a hyperspherical latent space, Falorsi et al. (2018) endowed the latent space with a SO(3) group structure, and Mathieu et al. (2019a); Ovinnikov (2019); Nagano et al. (2019) with hyperbolic geometry. Other spaces like product of constant curvature spaces (Skopek et al., 2019) and embedded manifolds (Rey et al., 2019) have also been considered. However, these works generally require careful design and training.

Normalizing flows Our use of a non-stochastic mapping shares some interesting links to normalizing flows (NFs) (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Papamakarios et al., 2019; Grathwohl et al., 2018; Dinh et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018; Papamakarios et al., 2018). Indeed a NF would be a valid, albeit unlikely, choice for  $g_{\psi}$ . However, unlike previous use of NFs in VAEs, our  $g_{\psi}$  is crucially shared between the generative and representational models, rather than just being used in the encoder, while the KL divergence in our framework is taken before, not after, the mapping. Moreover, the underlying motivation, and type of mapping typically used, differs substantially: our mapping is used to introduce inductive biases, not purely to improve inference. Our mapping is also more general than a NF (e.g. it need not be invertible) and does not introduce additional constraints or computational issues.

# 6 SPECIFIC REALIZATIONS OF THE INTEL-VAE FRAMEWORK

We now present several examples IntelL-VAEs, introducing various inductive biases through different choices of  $g_{\psi}$ . We will start with artificial, but surprisingly challenging, examples where some precise topological properties of the target distributions are known, incorporating them directly through a fixed  $g_{\psi}$ . We will then move onto experiments where we impose a fixed clustering inductive bias when training on image data, allowing us to learn IntelL-VAEs that account effectively for multi-modality in the data distribution. Finally, we consider the example of learning sparse representations of high-dimensional data. Here we will see that it is imperative to exploit the ability of IntelL-VAEs to learn aspects of  $g_{\psi}$  during training, providing a flexible inductive bias framework, rather than a pre-fixed mapping. By comparing IntelL-VAEs with strong baselines, we show that IntelL-VAEs are effective in introducing these desired inductive biases, and consequently both improve generation quality and learn better data representations for downstream tasks. One note of particular importance is that we find that IntelL-VAEs provide state-of-the-art performance for learning sparse representations in a VAE framework. A further example of using IntelL-VAEs to learn hierarchical representations is presented in Appendix B, while full details on the various examples are given in Appendix C.

# 6.1 MULTIPLE-CONNECTIVITY

Data is often most naturally described on non-Euclidean spaces such as circles, e.g. wind directions (Mardia & Jupp, 2000), and other multiply-connected shapes, e.g. holes in disease databases (Liu et al., 1997). For reasons previously explained in Sec. 2, standard VAEs cannot practically model such topologies, which prevents them from learning generative models which match even the simplest data distributions with non-trivial topological structures, as shown in Fig. 4b.

Luckily, by designing  $g_{\psi}$  to map the Gaussian prior to a simple representative distribution in a topological class, we can easily equip InteL-VAEs with the knowledge to approximate any data distributions with similar topological properties. Specifically, by defining  $g_{\psi}$  as the orthogonal projection to  $\mathbb{S}^1$ ,  $g_{\psi}(z) = \frac{z}{||z||_2 + \epsilon}$ , we map the Gaussian prior approximately to a uniform distribution to  $\mathbb{S}^1$ , where  $\epsilon$  is a small positive constant to ensure the continuity of  $g_{\psi}$  near the origin. From Rows 1 and 2 of Fig. 4, we find that this inductive bias gives InteL-VAEs the ability to learn various distributions with a hole. For more complex situations, we can add holes by simply 'gluing' point pairs, as described in Appendix C.1; Row 3 of Fig. 4 gives an example of learning an infinity sign by introducing a 'two-hole' inductive bias.

We emphasize here that our inductive bias does not contain the information about the precise shape of the data, only the number of holes. We thus see that InteL-VAEs can provide substantial improvements in performance by incorporating only basic prior information about the topological properties of the data.

InteL-VAE uses [Rows 1,2] circular prior with one hole, [Row 3] multiply-connected prior with two holes, and [Row 4] clustered prior. Vamp-VAE behaves similarly to a vanilla VAE; its results are presented in Appendix C.1.

# 6.2 MULTI-MODALITY

Many real-world datasets exhibit multi-modality. For example, data with distinct classes are often naturally clustered into (nearly) disconnected components representing each class. However, vanilla VAEs generally fail to fit multi-modal data due to the topological issues explained in Sec. 2. Previous work (Johnson et al., 2017; Mathieu et al., 2019b) has thus proposed the use of a multi-modal prior, such as a mixture of Gaussian (MoG) distribution, so as to capture all components of the data. Nonetheless, VAEs with such priors often still struggle to model multi-modal data because of mismatch between  $q_{\phi}(z)$  and  $p(z)$  or training instability issues.

We tackle this problem by using a mapping  $g_{\psi}$  which contains a clustering inductive bias. The high-level idea is to design a mapping  $g_{\psi}$  with a localized high Lipschitz constant that 'splits' the continuous Gaussian distribution into  $K$  disconnected parts and then pushes them away from each other. See Appendix C.2 for details.

We first consider a simple 2-component MoG synthetic dataset in the last row of Fig. 4. We see that the vanilla VAE fails to learn a clustered distribution that fits the data, while the IntelL-VAE sorts this issue and fits the data well.

<table><tr><td>Method</td><td>FID Score (↓)</td></tr><tr><td>VAE</td><td>42.0 ± 1.1</td></tr><tr><td>GM-VAE</td><td>41.0 ± 4.7</td></tr><tr><td>MoG-VAE</td><td>41.2 ± 3.3</td></tr><tr><td>Vamp-VAE</td><td>38.8 ± 2.4</td></tr><tr><td>VAE with Sylvester NF</td><td>35.0 ± 0.9</td></tr><tr><td>InteL-VAE</td><td>32.2 ± 1.5</td></tr></table>

To provide a more real-world example, we train an IntelL-VAE and a variety of baselines on the MNIST dataset, comparing the generation quality of the learned models using the FID score (Heusel et al., 2017) in Table 1. We find that the GM-VAE (Dilokthanakul et al., 2016) and MoG-VAE (VAE with a fixed MoG prior) achieve performance gains by using non-Gaussian priors. The VampVAE (Tomczak & Welling, 2018) and a VAE with a Sylvester Normalizing Flow (Berg et al., 2018) encoder provide further improvement by making the prior and encoder distributions more flexible respectively. However, the IntelL-VAE comfortably outperforms all of them.

To gain insight into how IntelL-VAEs achieve superior generation quality, we perform analysis on a simplified setting where we select only the '0' and '1' digits from the MNIST dataset to form a strongly clustered dataset, MNIST-01. We further decrease the latent dimension to 1 to make the problem more challenging. Fig. 5 shows that here the vanilla VAE generates

some samples which look like interpolations between '0' and '1', meaning that it still tries to learn a connected distribution containing '0' and '1'. Further, the general generation quality is poor, with blurred images and a lack of diversity in generated samples (e.g. all the '1's have the same slant). Despite using a clustered prior, the MoG-VAE still produces unwanted interpolations between the classes. By contrast, InteL-VAE generates digits that are unambiguous and crisp.

To quantify these results, we further train a logistic classifier on MNIST-01 and use it to classify images generated by each method. For each method, we calculate the proportion of samples produced by the generative model that are assigned to each class by this pre-trained classifier, as well as the proportion of samples for which the classifier is uncertain. From Table 2 we see that IntelL-VAE significantly outperforms its competitors in the ability to generate balanced and unambiguous digits. To extend this example further, and show the ability of IntelL-VAEs to

learn aspects of  $g_{\psi}$  during training, we further consider parameterizing and then learning the relative size of the clusters. Table 3 shows that this can be successfully learned by InteL-VAEs on MNIST-01.

# 6.3 SPARSITY

Sparse features are often well-suited to data efficiency on downstream tasks (Huang & Aviyente, 2006), in addition to being naturally easier to visualise and manipulate than dense features (Ng et al., 2011). However, existing VAE models for sparse representations trade off generation quality to achieve this sparsity (Mathieu et al., 2019b; Tonolini et al., 2020; Barello et al., 2018). Here, we show that InteL-VAEs can instead simultaneously increase feature sparsity and generation quality. Moreover, they are able to achieve state-of-the-art scores on sparsity metrics.

Compared with our previous examples, the  $g_{\psi}$  here needs to be more flexible so that it can learn to map points in a data-specific way and induce sparsity without unduly harming reconstruction. To achieve this, we use the simple form for the mapping:  $g_{\psi}(y) = y \odot \mathrm{DS}_{\psi}(y)$ , where  $\odot$  is pointwise multiplication, and DS is a neural network that selects dimensions to deactivate given  $y$ . DS outputs values between  $[0,1]$  for each dimension, with 0 being fully deactivated and 1 fully activated; the more dimensions we deactivate, the sparser the representation. By learning DS during training, this setup allows us to learn a sparse representation in a data-driven manner. To control the degree of sparsity, we add a sparsity regularizer,  $\mathcal{L}_{sp}$ , to the ELBO with weighting parameter  $\gamma$  (higher  $\gamma$  corresponds to more sparsity).  $\mathcal{L}_{sp}$ , which is detailed in Appendix C.3, encourages DS to deactivate more dimensions, while also encouraging diversity in which dimensions are activated for different data points, improving utilization of the latent space. Initial qualitative result is shown in Fig. 6, where we see that our InteL-VAE is able to learn sparse and intuitive representations.

To quantitatively assess the ability of our approach to yield sparse representations and good quality generations, we compare against vanilla VAEs, the specially customized sparse-VAE of Tonolini et al. (2020), and the sparse version of Mathieu et al. (2019b) (DD) on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017). As shown in Fig. 7, we find that InteL-VAEs increase sparsity of the representations—measured by the Hoyer metric (Hurley & Rickard, 2009)—while increasing generative sample quality at the same time. Indeed, the FID score obtained by InteL-VAE outperforms the vanilla VAE when  $\gamma < 3.0$ , while the sparsity score substantially increases with  $\gamma$ , reaching extremely high levels. By comparison, DD significantly degrades generation generation quality and only provides a more modest increase in sparsity, while its sparsity also drops if the regularization coefficient is set too high. The level of sparsity achieved by sparse-VAEs was substantially less than both DD and InteL-VAEs.

To further evaluate the quality of the learned features for downstream tasks, we trained a classifier to predict class labels from the latent representations. For this, we choose a random forest (Breiman, 2001) with maximum depth 4 as it is well-suited for sparse features. We vary the size of training data given to the classifier to measure the data efficiency of each model. Fig. 8 shows that IntelL-VAE typically outperforms other the models, especially in few-shot scenarios.

Finally, to verify IntelL-VAE's effectiveness on larger and higher-resolution datasets, we also make comparisons on CelebA (Liu et al., 2015). From Table 4, we can see that IntelL-VAE increase sparse scores to 0.46 without sacrificing generation quality. By comparison, the maximal sparse score that sparse-VAE gets is 0.30, with unacceptable sample quality. Interestingly, IntelL-VAEs with relative low regulation  $\gamma$  achieved particularly good generative sample quality, outperforming even the VampVAE and a VAE with a Sylvester NF encoder.

# 7 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we proposed InteL-VAEs, a general schema for incorporating inductive biases into VAEs. Experiments show that InteL-VAEs can both provide representations with desired properties and improve generation quality, outperforming a variety of baselines such as directly changing the prior. This is achieved while maintaining the simplicity and stability of the standard VAE framework.

# ETHICS STATEMENT

We do not believe that there are direct ethical concerns regarding our paper: the datasets we consider are all already well established and do not contain sensitive information, while the methods and ideas we introduce have no clear direct potential negative societal impacts of their own. From a bigger picture perspective, work like ours that looks to permit more effective incorporation of inductive biases into models can be thought of as allowing more direct human control on how models will behave after training. While this will typically be a force for good, for example by encouraging model interpretability and providing mechanisms to try and induce positive characteristics like fairness, in rare circumstances there may also be the potential for this to be used nefariously by deliberately encouraging undesirable behavior. However, we do not believe that our work is any more prone to such exploitation than existing methods or that the risk of it being used in such a way is significant.

# REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

Full experimental details are given in Appendix C, while anonymized source code for reproducing all our experiments directly is provided at https://github.com/djkdsjwkjerkjermf/InteL-VAE. Together these should make it straightforward for others to reproduce our empirical results. We have been careful to provide quantitative metrics of performance whenever possible, rather than just relying on qualitative or anecdotal evidence. Repeat runs and error bars are provided whenever this is feasible, with the level of variability always found to be sufficiently small to draw reliable and statistically sound conclusions. In fact, the training stability and consistent performance of our general approach under retraining provides a clear advantage in itself compared to many of the baseline methods. Full formal proof for our only theoretical result is given in Appendix A, while the assumptions it makes are clearly stated and easily verifiable.
