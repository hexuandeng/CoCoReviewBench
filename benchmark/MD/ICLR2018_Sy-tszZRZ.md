# ABSTRACT

In this paper, we study the representational power of deep neural networks (DNN) that belong to the family of piecewise-linear (PWL) functions, based on PWL activation units such as rectifier or maxout. We investigate the complexity of such networks by studying the number of linear regions of the PWL function. Typically, a PWL function from a DNN can be seen as a large family of linear functions acting on millions of such regions. We directly build upon the work of Montúfar et al. (2014), Montúfar (2017), and Raghu et al. (2017) by refining the upper and lower bounds on the number of linear regions for rectified and maxout networks. In addition to achieving tighter bounds, we also develop a novel method to perform exact enumeration or counting of the number of linear regions with a mixed-integer linear formulation that maps the input space to output. We use this new capability to visualize how the number of linear regions change while training DNNs.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

We have witnessed an unprecedented success of deep learning algorithms in computer vision, speech, and other domains (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Ciresan et al., 2012; Goodfellow et al., 2013; Hinton et al., 2012). While the popular deep learning architectures such as AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), and residual networks (He et al., 2016) have shown record beating performance on various image recognition tasks, empirical results still govern the design of network architecture in terms of depth and activation functions. Two important practical considerations that are part of most successful architectures are greater depth and the use of PwL activation functions such as rectified linear units (ReLUs). Due to the large gap between theory and practice, many researchers have been looking at the theoretical modeling of the representational power of DNNs (Cybenko, 1989; Anthony & Bartlett, 1999; Pascanu et al., 2014; Montúfar et al., 2014; Bianchini & Scarselli, 2014; Eldan & Shamir, 2016; Telgarsky, 2015; Mhaskar et al., 2016; Raghu et al., 2017; Montúfar, 2017).

Any continuous function can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy using a single hidden layer of sigmoid activation functions (Cybenko, 1989). This does not imply that shallow networks are sufficient to model all problems in practice. Typically, shallow networks require exponentially more number of neurons to model functions that can be modeled using much fewer activation functions in deeper ones (Delalleau & Bengio, 2011). There have been a wide variety of activation functions such as threshold  $(f(z) = (z > 0))$ , logistic  $(f(z) = 1 / (1 + \exp (-e)))$ , hyperbolic tangent  $(f(z) = \tanh(z))$ , rectified linear units (ReLUs  $f(z) = \max\{0, z\}$ ), and maxouts  $(f(z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_k) = \max\{z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_k\})$ . The activation functions offer different modeling capabilities. For example, sigmoid networks are shown to be more expressive than similar-sized threshold networks (Maass et al., 1994). It was recently shown that RLUs are more expressive than similar-sized threshold networks by deriving transformations from one network to another (Pan & Srikumar, 2016).

The complexity of neural networks belonging to the family of PWL functions can be analyzed by looking at how the network can partition the input space to an exponential number of linear response regions (Pascanu et al., 2014; Montúfar et al., 2014). The basic idea of a PWL function is simple: we can divide the input space into several regions and we have individual linear functions for each of these regions. Functions partitioning the input space to a larger number of linear regions are considered to be more complex ones, or in other words, possess better representational power. In the

case of ReLUs, it was shown that deep networks separate their input space into exponentially more linear response regions than their shallow counterparts despite using the same number of activation functions (Pascanu et al., 2014). The results were later extended and improved (MontuFar et al., 2014; Raghu et al., 2017; MontuFar, 2017; Arora et al., 2016). In particular, MontuFar et al. (2014) shows both upper and lower bounds on the maximal number of linear regions for a ReLU DNN and a single layer maxout network, and a lower bound for a maxout DNN. Furthermore, Raghu et al. (2017) and MontuFar (2017) improve the upper bound for a ReLU DNN. This upper bound asymptotically matches the lower bound from MontuFar et al. (2014) when the number of layers and input dimension are constant and all layers have the same width. Finally, Arora et al. (2016) improves the lower bound by providing a family of ReLU DNNs with an exponential number of regions given fixed size and depth.

In this work, we directly improve on the results of Montúfar et al. (Pascanu et al., 2014; Montúfar et al., 2014; Montúfar, 2017) and Raghu et al. (Raghu et al., 2017) in better understanding the representational power of DNNs employing PWL activation functions.

# 2 NOTATIONS AND BACKGROUND

We will only consider feedforward neural networks in this paper. Let us assume that the network has  $n_0$  input variables given by  $\mathbf{x} = \{x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n_{0}}\}$ , and  $m$  output variables given by  $\mathbf{y} = \{y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{m}\}$ . Each hidden layer  $l = \{1, 2, \ldots, L\}$  has  $n_{l}$  hidden neurons whose activations are given by  $\mathbf{h}^{l} = \{h_{1}^{l}, h_{2}^{l}, \ldots, h_{n_{l}}^{l}\}$ . Let  $W^{l}$  be the  $n_{l} \times n_{l-1}$  matrix where each row corresponds to the weights of a neuron of layer  $l$ . Let  $\mathbf{b}^{l}$  be the bias vector used to obtain the activation functions of neurons in layer  $l$ . Based on the  $\mathrm{ReLU}(x) = \max \{0, x\}$  activation function, the activations of the hidden neurons and the outputs are given below:

$$
\mathbf {h} ^ {1} = \max  \{0, W ^ {1} \mathbf {x} + b ^ {1} \}
$$

$$
\mathbf {h} ^ {l} = \max  \{0, W ^ {l} \mathbf {h} ^ {l - 1} + b ^ {l} \}
$$

$$
\mathbf {y} = W ^ {L + 1} \mathbf {h} ^ {\mathbf {L}}
$$

As considered in Pascanu et al. (2014), the output layer is a linear layer that computes the linear combination of the activations from the previous layer without any ReLUs.

We can treat the DNN as a piecewise linear (PWL) function  $F: \mathbb{R}^{n_0} \to \mathbb{R}^m$  that maps the input  $\mathbf{x}$  in  $\mathbb{R}^{n_0}$  to  $\mathbf{y}$  in  $\mathbb{R}^m$ . This paper primarily deals with investigating the bounds on the linear regions of this PwL function. There are two subtly different definitions for linear regions in the literature and we will formally define them.

Definition 1. Given a PWL function  $F: \mathbb{R}^{n_0} \to \mathbb{R}^m$ , a linear region is defined as a maximal connected subset of the input space  $\mathbb{R}^{n_0}$ , on which  $F$  is linear (Pascanu et al., 2014; Montúfar et al., 2014).

Activation Pattern: Let us consider an input vector  $\mathbf{x} = \{x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n_{0}}\}$ . For every layer  $l$  we define an activation set  $S^{l} \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, n_{l}\}$  such that  $e \in S^{l}$  if and only if the ReLU  $e$  is active, that is,  $h_{e}^{l} > 0$ . We aggregate these activation sets into a set  $\mathcal{S} = (S^{1}, \ldots, S^{l})$ , which we call an activation pattern. Note that we may consider activation patterns up to a layer  $l \leq L$ . Activation patterns were previously defined in terms of strings (Raghu et al., 2017; Montúfar, 2017).

We say that an input  $\mathbf{x}$  corresponds to an activation pattern  $S$  in a DNN if feeding  $\mathbf{x}$  to the DNN results in the activations in  $S$ .

Definition 2. Given a PWL function  $F: \mathbb{R}^{n_0} \to \mathbb{R}^m$  represented by a DNN, a linear region is the set of input vectors  $\mathbf{x}$  that corresponds to an activation pattern  $S$  in the DNN.

We prefer to look at linear regions as activation patterns and we interchangeably refer to  $S$  as an activation pattern or a region. Definitions 1 and 2 are essentially the same, except in a few degenerate cases. There could be scenarios where two different activation patterns may correspond to two adjacent regions with the same linear function. In this case, Definition 1 will produce only one linear region whereas Definition 2 will yield two linear regions. This has no effect on the bounds that we derive in this paper.

In Fig. 1(a) we show a simple ReLU DNN with two inputs  $\{x_{1}, x_{2}\}$  and 3 hidden layers.

The activation units  $\{a, b, c, d, e, f\}$  in the hidden layers can be thought of as hyperplanes that each divide the space in two. On one side of the hyperplane, the unit outputs a positive value. For all points on the other side of the hyperplane including itself, the unit outputs 0.

One may wonder: into how many regions do  $n$  hyperplanes split a space? Zaslavsky (1975) shows that an arrangement of  $n$  hyperplanes divides a  $d$ -dimensional space into at most  $\sum_{s=0}^{d} \binom{n}{s}$  regions, a bound that is attained when they are in general position. The term general position basically means that a small perturbation of the hyperplanes does not change the number of regions. This corresponds to the exact maximal number of regions of a single layer DNN with  $n$  ReLUs and input dimension  $d$ .

In Figs. 1(b)-(g), we provide a visualization of how ReLUs partition the input space. Figs. 1(e), (f), and (g) show the hyperplanes corresponding to the ReLUs at layers  $l = 1,2$ , and 3 respectively. Figs. 1(b), (c), and (d) consider these same hyperplanes in the input space  $x$ . In Fig. 1(b), as per Zaslavsky (1975), the 2D input space is partitioned into 4 regions  $\left(\binom{2}{0} + \binom{2}{1} + \binom{2}{2} = 4\right)$ . In Figs. 1(c) and (d), we add the hyperplanes from the second and third layers respectively, which are affected by the transformations applied in the earlier hidden layers. The regions are further partitioned as we consider additional layers.

Fig. 1 also highlights that activation boundaries behave like hyperplanes when inside a region and may bend whenever they intersect with a boundary from a previous layer. This has also been pointed out by Raghu et al. (2017). In particular, they cannot appear twice in the same region as they are defined by a single hyperplane if we fix the region. Moreover, these boundaries do not need to be connected, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

# Main Contributions

We summarize the main contributions of this paper below:

- We achieve tighter upper and lower bounds on the maximal number of linear regions of the PWL function corresponding to a DNN that employs ReLUs. As a special case, we present the exact maximal number of regions when the input dimension is one. We ad

ditionally provide the first upper bound on the number of linear regions for multi-layer maxout networks (See Sections 3 and 4).

- We show for ReLUs that the exact maximal number of linear regions of shallow networks is larger than that of deep networks if the input dimension exceeds the number of neurons. This result is particularly interesting, since it cannot be inferred from the bounds derived in prior work.  
- We use a mixed-integer linear formulation to show that exact counting of the linear regions is indeed possible. For the first time, we show the exact counting of the number of linear regions for several small-sized DNNs during the training process. This new capability can be used to evaluate the tightness of the bounds and potentially analyze the correlation between validation accuracy and the number of linear regions. It also provides new insights as to how the linear regions vary during the training process (See Section 5 and 6).

# 3 TIGHTER BOUNDS FOR RECTIFIER NETWORKS

Montúfar et al. (2014) derive an upper bound of  $2^{N}$  for  $N$  hidden units, which can be obtained by mapping linear regions to activation patterns. Raghu et al. (2017) improves this result by deriving an asymptotic upper bound of  $O(n^{Ln_0})$  to the maximal number of regions, assuming  $n_l = n$  for all layers  $l$  and  $n_0 = O(1)$ . Montúfar (2017) further tightens the upper bound to  $\prod_{l=1}^{L}\sum_{j=0}^{d_l}\binom{n_l}{j}$ , where  $d_l = \min\{n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_l\}$ .

Moreover, Montúfar et al. (2014) prove a lower bound of  $\left( \prod_{l=1}^{L-1} \lfloor n_l / n_0 \rfloor^{n_0} \right) \sum_{j=0}^{n_0} \binom{n_L}{j}$  when  $n \geq n_0$ , or asymptotically  $\Omega((n / n_0)^{(L-1)n_0}n^{n_0})$ . Arora et al. (2016) present a lower bound of  $2 \sum_{j=0}^{n_0-1} \binom{m-1}{j}w^{L-1}$  where  $2m = n_1$  and  $w = n_l$  for all  $l = 2,\ldots,L$ . By choosing  $m$  and  $w$  appropriately, this lower bound is  $\Omega(s^{n_0})$  where  $s$  is the total size of the network. We derive both upper and lower bounds that improve upon these previous results.

# 3.1 AN UPPER BOUND ON THE NUMBER OF LINEAR REGIONS

In this section, we prove the following upper bound on the number of regions.

Theorem 1. Consider a deep rectifier network with  $L$  layers,  $n_l$  rectified linear units at each layer  $l$ , and an input of dimension  $n_0$ . The maximal number of regions of this neural network is at most

$$
\sum_{(j_{1},\ldots ,j_{L})\in J}\prod_{l = 1}^{L}\binom {n_{l}}{j_{l}}
$$

where  $J = \{(j_{1},\ldots ,j_{L})\in \mathbb{Z}^{L}:0\leq j_{l}\leq \min \{n_{0},n_{1} - j_{1},\ldots ,n_{l - 1} - j_{l - 1},n_{l}\} \forall l = 1,\ldots ,L\}$  This bound is tight when  $L = 1$

Note that this is a stronger upper bound than the one that appeared in Montúfar (2017), which can be derived from this bound by relaxing the terms  $n_l - j_l$  to  $n_l$  and factoring the expression. When  $n_0 = O(1)$  and all layers have the same width  $n$ , this expression has the same best known asymptotic bound  $O(n^{Ln_0})$  first presented in Raghu et al. (2017).

Two insights can be extracted from the above expression:

1. Bottleneck effect. The bound is sensitive to the positioning of layers that are small relative to the others, a property we call the bottleneck effect. If we subtract a neuron from one of two layers with the same width, choosing the one closer to the input layer will lead to a larger (or equal) decrease in the bound. This occurs because each index  $j_{l}$  is essentially limited by the widths of the current and previous layers,  $n_0, n_1, \ldots, n_l$ . In other words, smaller widths in the first few layers of the network imply a bottleneck on the bound.

In particular for a 2-layer network, we show in Appendix A that if the input dimension is sufficiently large to not create its own bottleneck, then moving a neuron from the first layer to the second layer strictly decreases the bound, as it tightens a bottleneck.

Figure 3a illustrates this behavior. For the solid line, we keep the total size of the network the same but shift from a small-to-large network (i.e., smaller width near the input layer and larger width near the output layer) to a large-to-small network in terms of width. We see that the bound monotonically increases as we reduce the bottleneck. If we add a layer of constant width at the end, represented by the dashed line, the bound decreases when the layers before the last become too small and create a bottleneck for the last layer.

While this is a property of the upper bound rather than one of the exact maximal number of regions, we observe in Section 6 that empirical results for the number of regions of a trained network exhibit a behavior that resembles the bound as the width of the layers vary.

2. Deep vs shallow for large input dimensions. In several applications such as imaging, the input dimension can be very large. Montúfar et al. (2014) show that if the input dimension  $n_0$  is constant, then the number of regions of deep networks is asymptotically larger than that of shallow (single-layer) networks. We complement this picture by establishing that if the input dimension is large, then shallow networks can attain more regions than deep networks.

More precisely, we compare a deep network with  $L$  layers of equal width  $n$  and a shallow network with one layer of width  $Ln$ . In Appendix A, we show using Theorem 1 that if the input dimension  $n_0$  exceeds the size of the network  $Ln$ , then the ratio between the exact maximal number of regions of the deep and of the shallow network goes to zero as  $L$  approaches infinity.

We also show in Appendix A that in a 2-layer network, if the input dimension  $n_0$  is larger than both widths  $n_1$  and  $n_2$ , then turning it into a shallow network with a layer of  $n_1 + n_2$  ReLUs increases the exact maximal number of regions.

Figure 3b illustrates this behavior. As we increase the number of layers while keeping the total size of the network constant, the bound plateaus at a value lower than the exact maximal number of regions for shallow networks. Moreover, the number of layers that yields the highest bound decreases as we increase the input dimension  $n_0$ .

It is important to note that this property cannot be inferred from previous upper bounds derived in prior work, since they are at least  $2^{N}$  when  $n_0 \geq \max\{n_1, \ldots, n_L\}$ , where  $N$  is the total number of neurons.

We remark that asymptotically both deep and shallow networks can attain exponentially many regions when the input dimension is at least  $n$  (see Appendix B).

Figure 3: Bounds from Theorem 1: (a) is in semilog scale, has input dimension  $n_0 = 32$ , and the width of the first five layers is  $16 - 2k$ ,  $16 - k$ ,  $16 + k$ ,  $16 + 2k$ ; (b) is in linear scale, evenly distributes 60 neurons in 1 to 6 layers (the single-layer case is exact), and the input dimension varies.

We now build towards the proof of Theorem 1. For a given activation set  $S^l$  and a matrix  $W$  with  $n_l$  rows, let  $\sigma_{S^l}(W)$  be the operation that zeroes out the rows of  $W$  that are inactive according to  $S^l$ . This represents the effect of the ReLUs. For a region  $S$  at layer  $l - 1$ , define  $\bar{W}_S^l \coloneqq W^l\sigma_{S^{l - 1}}(W^{l - 1})\dots \sigma_{S^1}(W^1)$ .

Each region  $S$  at layer  $l - 1$  may be partitioned by a set of hyperplanes defined by the neurons of layer  $l$ . When viewed in the input space, these hyperplanes are the rows of  $\bar{W}_S^l x + b = 0$  for some  $b$ . To verify this, note that, if we recursively substitute out the hidden variables  $h_{l-1}, \ldots, h_1$  from the original hyperplane  $W^l h_{l-1} + b_l = 0$  following  $S$ , the resulting weight matrix applied to  $x$  is  $\bar{W}_S^l$ .

Finally, we define the dimension of a region  $S$  at layer  $l - 1$  as  $\dim(S) := \operatorname{rank}(\sigma_{S^{l-1}}(W^{l-1}) \cdots \sigma_{S^1}(W^1))$ . This can be interpreted as the dimension of the space corresponding to  $S$  that  $W^l$  effectively partitions.

The proof of Theorem 1 focuses on the dimension of each region  $S$ . A key observation is that once it falls to a certain value, the regions contained in  $S$  cannot recover to a higher dimension.

Zaslavsky (1975) showed that the maximal number of regions in  $\mathbb{R}^d$  induced by an arrangement of  $m$  hyperplanes is at most  $\sum_{j=0}^{d} \binom{m}{j}$ . Moreover, this value is attained if and only if the hyperplanes are in general position. The lemma below tightens this bound for a special case where the hyperplanes may not be in general position.

Lemma 2. Consider  $m$  hyperplanes in  $\mathbb{R}^d$  defined by the rows of  $Wx + b = 0$ . Then the number of regions induced by the hyperplanes is at most  $\sum_{j=0}^{\operatorname{rank}(W)} \binom{m}{j}$ .

The proof is given in Appendix C. Its key idea is that it suffices to count regions within the row space of  $W$ . The next lemma brings Lemma 2 into our context.

Lemma 3. The number of regions induced by the  $n_l$  neurons at layer  $l$  within a certain region  $S$  is at most  $\sum_{j=0}^{\min\{n_l, \dim(S)\}} \binom{n_l}{j}$ .

Proof. The hyperplanes in a region  $S$  of the input space are given by the rows of  $\bar{W}_S^l x + b = 0$  for some  $b$ . By the definition of  $\bar{W}_S^l$ , the rank of  $\bar{W}_S^l$  is upper bounded by  $\min \{\mathrm{rank}(W^l), \mathrm{rank}(\sigma_{S^{l-1}}(W^{l-1}) \cdots \sigma_{S^1}(W^1))\} = \min \{\mathrm{rank}(W^l), \dim(S)\}$ . That is,  $\mathrm{rank}(\bar{W}_S^l) \leq \min \{n_l, \dim(S)\}$ . Applying Lemma 2 yields the result.

In the next lemma, we show that the dimension of a region  $S$  can be bounded recursively in terms of the dimension of the region containing  $S$  and the number of activated neurons defining  $S$ .

Lemma 4. Let  $S$  be a region at layer  $l$  and  $S'$  be the region at layer  $l - 1$  that contains it. Then  $\dim(S) \leq \min\{|S^l|, \dim(S')\}$ .

Proof.  $\dim(S) = \operatorname{rank}(\sigma_{S^l}(W^l) \cdots \sigma_{S^1}(W^1)) \leq \min\{\operatorname{rank}(\sigma_{S^l}(W^l)), \operatorname{rank}(\sigma_{S^{l-1}}(W^{l-1}) \cdots \sigma_{S^1}(W^1)) \leq \min\{|S^l|, \dim(S')\}$ . The last inequality comes from the fact that the zeroed out rows do not count towards the rank of the matrix.

In the remainder of the proof of Theorem 1, we combine Lemmas 3 and 4 to construct a recurrence  $R(l,d)$  that bounds the number of regions within a given region of dimension  $d$ . Simplifying this recurrence yields the expression in Theorem 1. We formalize this idea and complete the proof of Theorem 1 in Appendix D.

As a side note, Theorem 1 can be further tightened if the weight matrices are known to have small rank. The bound from Lemma 3 can be rewritten as  $\sum_{j=0}^{\min\{\mathrm{rank}(W^l), \dim(S)\}} \binom{n_l}{j}$  if we do not relax  $\mathrm{rank}(W^l)$  to  $n_l$  in the proof. The term  $\mathrm{rank}(W^l)$  follows through the proof of Theorem 1 and the index set  $J$  in the theorem becomes  $\{(j_1, \ldots, j_L) \in \mathbb{Z}^L : 0 \leq j_l \leq \min\{n_0, n_1 - j_1, \ldots, n_{l-1} - j_{l-1}, \mathrm{rank}(W^l)\} \forall l \geq 1\}$ .

A key insight from Lemmas 3 and 4 is that the dimensions of the regions are non-increasing as we move through the layers partitioning it. In other words, if at any layer the dimension of a region becomes small, then that region will not be able to be further partitioned into a large number of regions. For instance, if the dimension of a region falls to zero, then that region will never be further partitioned. This suggests that if we want to have many regions, we need to keep dimensions high. We use this idea in the next section to construct a DNN with many regions.

# 3.2 THE CASE OF DIMENSION ONE

If the input dimension  $n_0$  is equal to 1 and  $n_l = n$  for all layers  $l$ , the upper bound presented in the previous section reduces to  $(n + 1)^L$ . On the other hand, the lower bound given by Montúfar et al. (2014) becomes  $n^{L - 1}(n + 1)$ . It is then natural to ask: are either of these bounds tight? The answer is that the upper bound is tight in the case of  $n_0 = 1$ , assuming there are sufficiently many neurons.

Theorem 5. Consider a deep rectifier network with  $L$  layers,  $n_l \geq 3$  rectified linear units at each layer  $l$ , and an input of dimension 1. The maximal number of regions of this neural network is exactly  $\prod_{l=1}^{L}(n_l + 1)$ .

The expression above is a simplified form of the upper bound from Theorem 1 in the case  $n_0 = 1$ .

The proof of this theorem in Appendix E has a construction with  $n + 1$  regions that replicate themselves as we add layers, instead of  $n$  as in Montúfar et al. (2014). That is motivated by an insight from the previous section: in order to obtain more regions, we want the dimension of every region to be as large as possible. When  $n_0 = 1$ , we want all regions to have dimension one. This intuition leads to a new construction with one additional region that can be replicated with other strategies.

# 3.3 A LOWER BOUND ON THE MAXIMAL NUMBER OF LINEAR REGIONS

Both the lower bound from Montúfar et al. (2014) and from Arora et al. (2016) can be slightly improved, since their approaches are based on extending a 1-dimensional construction similar to the one in Section 3.2. We do both since they are not directly comparable: the former bound is in terms of the number of neurons in each layer and the latter is in terms of the total size of the network.

Theorem 6. The maximal number of linear regions induced by a rectifier network with  $n_0$  input units and  $L$  hidden layers with  $n_l \geq 3n_0$  for all  $l$  is lower bounded by

$$
\left(\prod_ {l = 1} ^ {L - 1} \left(\left\lfloor \frac {n _ {l}}{n _ {0}} \right\rfloor + 1\right) ^ {n _ {0}}\right) \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {n _ {0}} \binom {n _ {L}} {j}.
$$

The proof of this theorem is in Appendix F. For comparison, the differences between the lower bound theorem (Theorem 5) from Montúfar et al. (2014) and the above theorem is the replacement of the condition  $n_{l} \geq n_{0}$  by the more restrictive  $n_{l} \geq 3n_{0}$ , and of  $\lfloor n_{l} / n_{0} \rfloor$  by  $\lfloor n_{l} / n_{0} \rfloor + 1$ .

Theorem 7. For any values of  $m \geq 1$  and  $w \geq 2$ , there exists a rectifier network with  $n_0$  input units and  $L$  hidden layers of size  $2m + w(L - 1)$  that has  $2\sum_{j=0}^{n_0-1}\binom{m-1}{j}(w+1)^{L-1}$  linear regions.

The proof of this theorem is in Appendix G. The differences between Theorem 2.11(i) from Arora et al. (2016) and the above theorem is the replacement of  $w$  by  $w + 1$ . They construct a  $2m$ -width layer with many regions and use a one-dimensional construction for the remaining layers.

# 4 AN UPPER BOUND ON THE NUMBER OF LINEAR REGIONS FOR MAXOUT NETWORKS

We now consider a deep neural network composed of maxout units. Given weights  $W_{j}^{l}$  for  $j = 1, \ldots, k$ , the output of a rank- $k$  maxout layer  $l$  is given by

$$
\mathbf {h} ^ {l} = \max  \left\{W _ {1} ^ {l} \mathbf {h} ^ {l - 1} + b _ {1} ^ {l}, \dots , W _ {k} ^ {l} \mathbf {h} ^ {l - 1} + b _ {k} ^ {l} \right\}
$$

In terms of bounding number of regions, a major difference between the next result for maxout units and the previous one for ReLUs is that reductions in dimensionality due to inactive neurons with zeroed output become a particular case now. Nevertheless, using techniques similar to the ones from Section 3.1, the following theorem can be shown (see Appendix H for the proof).

Theorem 8. Consider a deep neural network with  $L$  layers,  $n_l$  rank-  $k$  maxout units at each layer  $l$ , and an input of dimension  $n_0$ . The maximal number of regions of this neural network is at most

$$
\prod_ {l = 1} ^ {L} \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {d _ {l}} \left( \begin{array}{c} \frac {k (k - 1)}{2} n _ {l} \\ j \end{array} \right)
$$

where  $d_{l} = \min \{n_{0}, n_{1}, \ldots, n_{l}\}$ .

Asymptotically, if  $n_l = n$  for all  $l = 1, \ldots, L$ ,  $n \geq n_0$ , and  $n_0 = O(1)$ , then the maximal number of regions is at most  $O((k^2 n)^{Ln_0})$ .

# 5 EXACT COUNTING OF LINEAR REGIONS

If the input space  $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_0}$  is bounded by minimum and maximum values along each dimension, or else if  $\mathbf{x}$  corresponds to a polytope more generally, then we can define a mixed-integer linear formulation mapping polyhedral regions of  $\mathbf{x}$  to the output space  $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ . The assumption that  $\mathbf{x}$  is bounded and polyhedral is natural in most applications, where each value  $x_i$  has known lower and upper bounds (e.g., the value can vary from 0 to 1 for image pixels). Among other things, we can use this formulation to count the number of linear regions.

In the formulation that follows, we use continuous variables to represent the input  $\mathbf{x}$ , which we can also denote as  $\mathbf{h}^0$ , the output of each neuron  $i$  in layer  $l$  as  $h_i^l$ , and the output  $\mathbf{y}$  as  $\mathbf{h}^{L + 1}$ . To simplify the representation, we lift this formulation to a space that also contains the output of a complementary set of neurons, each of which is active when the corresponding neuron is not. Namely, for each neuron  $i$  in layer  $l$  we also have a variable  $\overline{h}_i^l \coloneqq \max \{0, -W_i^l h^{l-1} - b_i^l\}$ . We use binary variables of the form  $z_i^l$  to denote if each neuron  $i$  in layer  $l$  is active or else if the complement of such neuron is. Finally, we assume  $M$  to be a sufficiently large constant.

For a given neuron  $i$  in layer  $l$ , the following set of constraints maps the input to the output:

$$
W _ {i} ^ {l} h ^ {l - 1} + b _ {i} ^ {l} = h _ {i} ^ {l} - \bar {h} _ {i} ^ {l}, h _ {i} ^ {l} \leq M z _ {i} ^ {l}, \bar {h} _ {i} ^ {l} \leq M \left(1 - z _ {i} ^ {l}\right), h _ {i} ^ {l} \geq 0, \bar {h} _ {i} ^ {l} \geq 0, z _ {i} ^ {l} \in \{0, 1 \} \tag {1}
$$

Theorem 9. Provided that  $|w_i^l h_j^{l-1} + b_i^l| \leq M$  for any possible value of  $h^{l-1}$ , a formulation with the set of constraints (1) for each neuron of a rectifier network is such that a feasible solution with a fixed value for  $x$  yields the output  $y$  of the neural network.

The proof for the statement above is given in Appendix I. More details on the procedure for exact counting are in Appendix J. In addition, we show the theory for unrestricted inputs and a mixed-integer formulation for maxout networks in Appendices K and L, respectively.

These results have important consequences. First, they allow us to tap into the literature of mixed-integer representability (Jeroslow, 1987) and disjunctive programming (Balas, 1979) to understand what can be modeled on rectifier networks with a finite number of neurons and layers. To the best of our knowledge, that has not been discussed before. Second, they imply that we can use mixed-integer optimization solvers to analyze the  $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$  mapping of a trained neural network. For example, Cheng et al. (2017) use another mixed-integer formulation to generate adversarial examples of a DNN. That is technically feasible due to the linear proportion between the size of the neural network and that of the mixed-integer formulation. Compared to Cheng et al. (2017), we show in Appendix I that formulation (1) can be implemented with further refinements on the value of the  $M$  constants.

# 6 EXPERIMENTS

We perform two different experiments for region counting using small-sized networks with ReLU activation units on the MNIST benchmark dataset (LeCun et al., 1998). In the first experiment, we generate rectifier networks with 1 to 4 hidden layers having 10 neurons each, with final test error between 6 and  $8\%$ . The training was carried out for 20 epochs or training steps, and we count the number of linear regions during each training step. For those networks, we count the number of linear regions within  $0 \leq x \leq 1$  in which a single neuron is active in the output layer, hence partitioning these regions in terms of the digits that they classify. In Fig. 4, we show how the number of regions classifying each digit progresses during training. Some digits have zero linear regions in the beginning, which explains why they begin later in the plot. The total number of such regions per training step is presented in Fig. 5(a) and error measures are found in Appendix M. Overall, we observe that the number of linear regions jumps orders of magnitude are varies more widely for each added layer. Furthermore, there is an initial jump in the number of linear regions classifying each digit that seems proportional to the number of layers.

(b) Comparison of upper bounds from Montúfar et al. (2014), Montúfar (2017), and from Theorem 1 with the total number of linear regions of a network with two hidden layers totaling 22 neurons.

In the second experiment, we train rectifier networks with two hidden layers summing up to 22 neurons. We train a network for each width configuration under the same conditions as above, with the test error in half of them ranging from 5 to  $6\%$ . In this case, we count all linear regions within  $0 \leq x \leq 1$ , hence not restricting by activation in output layer as before. The number of linear regions of these networks are plotted in Fig. 5(b), along with the upper bound from Theorem 1 and the upper bounds from Montúfar et al. (2014) and Montúfar (2017). Error measures of both experiments can be found in Appendix M and runtimes for counting the linear regions in Appendix N.

# 7 DISCUSSION

The representational power of a DNN can be studied by observing the number of linear regions of the PWL function that the DNN represents. In this work, we improve on the upper and lower bounds on the linear regions for rectified networks derived in prior work (Montúfar et al., 2014; Raghu et al., 2017; Montúfar, 2017; Arora et al., 2016) and introduce a first upper bound for multi-layer maxout networks. We obtain several valuable insights from our extensions.

Our ReLU upper bound indicates that small widths in early layers cause a bottleneck effect on the number of regions. If we reduce the width of an early layer, the dimensions of the linear regions become irrecoverably smaller throughout the network and the regions will not be able to be partitioned as much. Moreover, the dimensions of the linear regions are not only driven by width, but also the number of activated ReLUs corresponding to the region. This intuition allowed us to create a 1-dimensional construction with the maximal number of regions by eliminating a zero-dimensional bottleneck. An unexpected and useful consequence of our result is that shallow networks can attain more linear regions when the input dimensions exceed the number of neurons of the DNN.

In addition to achieving tighter bounds, we use a mixed-integer linear formulation that maps the input space to the output to show the exact counting of the number of linear regions for several small-sized DNNs during the training process. In the first experiment, we observed that the number of linear regions correctly classifying each digit of the MNIST benchmark increases and vary in proportion to the depth of the network during the first training epochs. In the second experiment, we count the total number of linear regions as we vary the width of two layers with a fixed number of neurons, and we experimentally validate the bottleneck effect by observing that the results follow a similar pattern to the upper bound that we show.

Our current results suggest new avenues for future research. First, we believe that the study of linear regions may eventually lead to insights in how to design better DNNs in practice, for example by further validating the bottleneck effect found in this study. Other properties of the bounds may turn into actionable insights if confirmed as these bounds get sufficiently close to the actual number of regions. For example, the plots in Appendix O show that there are particular network depths that maximize our ReLU upper bound for a given input dimension and number of neurons. In a sense, the number of neurons is a proxy to the computational resources available. We also believe that analyzing the shape of the linear regions is a promising idea for future work, which could provide further insight in how to design DNNs. Another important line of research is to understand the exact relation between the number of linear regions and accuracy, which may also involve the potential for overfitting. We conjecture that the network training is not likely to generalize well if there are so many regions that each point can be singled out in a different region, in particular if regions with similar labels are unlikely to be compositionally related. Second, applying exact counting to larger networks would depend on more efficient algorithms or on using approximations instead. In any case, the exact counting at a smaller scale can assess the quality of the current bounds and possibly derive insights for tighter bounds in future work, hence leading to insights that could be scaled up.
