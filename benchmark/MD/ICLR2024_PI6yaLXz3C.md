# ABSTRACT

Contrastive learning has proven instrumental in learning unbiased representations of data, especially in complex environments characterized by high-cardinality and high-dimensional sensitive information. However, existing approaches within this setting require predefined modelling assumptions of bias-causing interactions that limit the model's ability to learn debiased representations. In this work, we propose a new method for fair contrastive learning that employs an attention mechanism to model bias-causing interactions, enabling the learning of a fairer and semantically richer embedding space. In particular, our attention mechanism avoids bias-causing samples that confound the model and focuses on bias-reducing samples that help learn semantically meaningful representations. We verify the advantages of our method against existing baselines in fair contrastive learning and show that our approach can significantly boost bias removal from learned representations without compromising downstream accuracy.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Machine learning models are continuing to achieve impressive results across diverse domains. Wider adoption and development of such models pose immense opportunity, yet there simultaneously exists a substantial risk of societal harm in situations where models propagate forward biases encoded in training data (Lv et al., 2023; Creager et al., 2019; Madras et al., 2018). In particular, existing facial recognition systems demonstrate racial bias in their classifications, failing to recognize people from certain ethnic groups (Cavazos et al., 2020). In addition, generative language models, such as GPT-2, have been shown to reproduce gender bias in their generated text, for example in systematically assuming doctors are male and nurses are female among other socially biased outcomes (Kirk et al., 2021; Bender et al., 2021).

One effective approach to resolving this problem is fair representation learning (Wang et al. (2019); Khajehnejad et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2023)). This approach recognizes that bias is encoded at the data level and looks to learn representations of the data that preserve relevant semantic content while removing sensitive information related to a specified protected attribute, such as race, gender, age, geographic location, and so on. Specifically, contrastive learning has been used to learn fair representations. This technique learns similar representations for positively-paired samples and dissimilar representations for negatively-paired samples (Chuang et al. (2020); Tian et al. (2020); He et al. (2020)). For example, a positive-pair in the vision setting may be augmentations of the same image and a negative-pair may be any pair of distinct images (Chen et al., 2020). Thus, designing positive and negative pairs in the right way informs the model what features are semantically meaningful and what features are irrelevant in distinguishing samples. This approach then lends itself to fairness when we design positives and negatives such that the model learns representations that are invariant to the protected attribute, thereby removing sensitive information related to the protected attribute from the learned representations.

Existing work in fair contrastive learning often assumes the protected attribute to be a binary variable, such as gender or minority status. Popular fair contrastive learning methods include bias-label flipping, bias-label augmenting, and parity-enforcing regularizers (Cheng et al., 2021; Ling et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2021; Barbano et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2021; Hong & Yang, 2021). These approaches, while effective in the binary setting, are limited in their usability due to their conceptualization of fairness as a binary problem in which samples can only belong to one of two groups in terms of the protected attribute, such as male/female or majority/minority. As a

result, they fail to generalize to the harder and more general problem setting of high-cardinality, high-dimensional, and/or continuous protected attributes. Recently, Tsai et al. (2022) considers the continuous protected attribute setting and proposes a conditional sampling procedure in which negative pairs are sampled according to their similarity in the bias dimension. This approach, however, requires a pre-defined kernel function which imposes strong assumptions on the bias-causing interactions among samples. This is because the chosen kernel function specifies exactly for any given similarity between negative samples in the bias dimension the relevance of that sample for contrasting with the positive pair. These strong assumptions on the bias-causing interactions among samples limits the model's ability to learn fair representations and additionally requires expensive matrix inversion operations.

Contribution: We propose the Fairness-Aware (FARE) attention mechanism that attends towards bias-reducing samples and avoids bias-causing samples that confound the model. We further leverage sparsification via locality-sensitive hashing (Shrivastava & Li, 2014; Andoni et al., 2015; Kitaev et al., 2020) to discard extreme bias-causing samples in FARE and propose the Sparse Fairness-Aware (SparseFARE) attention. Our approach is based on the assumption that using similar samples in the bias dimension should prevent the protected information from being used to differentiate samples, thereby removing the sensitive information from the learned representations. FARE and SparseFARE are designed to learn a similarity metric across the protected attributes that capture the bias-causing interactions. To train FARE, we derive the new Fair Attention-Contrastive (FARE-Contrast) loss that expresses the negative samples as the output of the FARE attention mechanism, in which similarity scores of negative samples are conditioned by learned attention scores. Our contribution is three-fold.

- We develop FARE, a novel fairness-aware attention mechanism that captures the bias-causing interactions to reduce bias and learn semantically relevant embedding spaces.  
- We sparsify FARE to enhance its ability to learn fair representation by discarding extreme bias-causing samples, resulting in the SparseFARE attention.  
- We derive the FAREContrast loss to train FARE.

We empirically demonstrate that compared to the baseline methods, FARE alleviates a significantly larger amount of bias without compromising downstream accuracy and with lower computational complexity.

Notation: Let calligraphic letters represent datapas spaces (e.g.  $\mathcal{X}$ ), capital letters represent random variables (e.g.  $X$ ), lower case letter represent their outcomes (e.g.  $x$ ), and  $P$  represent distributions of the variable in the subscript (e.g.  $P_{X}$ ). We abuse notation slightly and also denote matrices by capital letters and vectors comprising matrices by lower case letters (e.g.  $Q = [q_{1},\ldots ,q_{n}]^{\top}$  where  $Q\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$  and  $q_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{k}$ ), in which cases we make clear that the capital and lower case letters correspond to matrices and vectors rather than random variables and outcomes.

Organization: We structure this paper as follows: Section 2 establishes the necessary technical background. Section 3 derives the FARE and SparseFARE attention mechanisms, as well as the FAREContrast objective loss. Section 4 provides the empirical validation of our proposed attention-based methods. Section 5 discusses related work. The paper ends with concluding remarks. Additional details on experimental setup, further results, and other technical details are found in the Appendix.

# 2 BACKGROUND

In this section, we summarize the technical preliminaries needed to develop our method, comprising conditional contrastive learning and attention mechanisms.

# 2.1 CONDITIONAL CONTRASTIVE LEARNING

Contrastive methods learn an encoding of the data such that similar samples are near each other while dissimilar samples are far from each other in the embedding space (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; Hjelm et al., 2018). This is done by sampling a positive sample  $y_{pos}$  and negative sample  $y_{neg}$  for any given  $x \in \mathcal{X}$ , where the encoder learns a representation such that  $x$  and  $y_{pos}$  are near each other while  $x$  and  $y_{neg}$  are distant. Conditional contrastive methods extend this approach to allow for conditional sampling on an additional variable  $Z$ , which in the fairness setting is a protected attribute (Tsai et al., 2022). In particular, the data pair  $(x, y_{pos})$  is sampled from  $P_{XY|Z = z}$

as  $x$  and  $y_{pos}$  are views of one another (obtained via augmentation) and  $(x, y_{neg})$  is sampled from  $P_{X|Z = z} P_{Y|Z = z}$  as  $x$  and  $y_{neg}$  are two distinct samples (Oord et al., 2018; Tsai et al., 2021a).

The Fair-InfoNCE objective (Tsai et al. (2021b)) is then defined as:

$$
\sup  _ {f} \mathbb {E} _ {z \sim P _ {Z}, (x, y _ {p o s}) \sim P _ {X Y | Z = z}, \{y _ {n e g} \} _ {i = 1} ^ {b} \sim P _ {Y | Z = z} ^ {\otimes b}} \left[ \log \frac {e ^ {f (x , y _ {p o s})}}{e ^ {f (x , y _ {p o s})} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {b} e ^ {f (x , y _ {n e g} , i)}} \right] \tag {1}
$$

where  $b$  denotes the batch size and  $f:\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}\to \mathbb{R}$  is a mapping parameterized by neural networks  $g_{\theta_X},g_{\theta_Y}$ , given by:

$$
f (x, y) = \operatorname {c o s i n e} \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} (x), g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) / \tau , \tag {2}
$$

where the networks are themselves parameterized by  $\theta_{X},\theta_{Y}$  and  $\tau$  is a hyperparameter scaling the cosine similarity (Chen et al., 2020). In many cases, as in ours,  $g_{\theta_X} = g_{\theta_Y}$ . The function  $f$  from 2 is referred to as the scoring function between samples  $x,y$  and evaluates the similarity between the learned embeddings of the neural network. Hence, the learning objective aims to maximize the score for positive pairs and minimize the score for negative pairs.

We also express the exponential scoring function in terms of an inner product in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) with corresponding feature map (Tsai et al., 2022) as follows:

$$
e ^ {f (x, y)} = \exp \left(\cos \text {s i m i l a r i t y} \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} (x), g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) / \tau\right) := \left\langle \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} (x)\right), \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) \right\rangle_ {\mathcal {H}}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $\langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$  is the inner product in RKHS  $\mathcal{H}$  and  $\phi$  is the feature map associated with  $\mathcal{H}$ .<sup>1</sup>

# 2.2 ATTENTION MECHANISM

The scaled dot-product attention mechanism (Vaswani et al. (2017)) is given as:

$$
\operatorname {A t t e n t i o n} (Q, K, V) = \underbrace {\operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\frac {Q K ^ {\top}}{\rho}\right)} _ {P} V,
$$

where  $Q = TW_{Q}$ ,  $K = SW_{K}$  and  $V = UW_{V}$  representing the queries, keys and values respectively, which are obtained via learnable linear projections,  $W_{Q}$ ,  $W_{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{m} \times d_{k}}$ ,  $W_{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{m} \times d_{v}}$ , of data matrices  $S \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_{m}}$ ,  $T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_{m}}$ ,  $U \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_{m}}$  where  $n$  is the sequence length,  $d_{m}$  is the embedding dimension and  $d_{v}$  is the chosen hidden dimension of the projection subspaces. The softmax operator is applied row-wise, and  $\rho$  is a temperature hyperparameter most often set to  $\sqrt{d}$ . We refer to  $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  as the attention map, which contains information regarding the learned similarities between individual keys and queries. In many cases,  $S = T = U$ , referred to as self-attention. Our model is inspired by self-attention, where we take  $S = T = Z$ , where  $Z = [z_{1}, \ldots, z_{n}]^{\top}$  is the input sequence of protected attributes, but  $U \neq Z$ . Instead, for our purposes, we take  $U \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  with entries  $[U]_{ij} = e^{f(x_i, y_j)}$  which is the matrix of similarity scores between samples  $x_{i}, y_{j}$ . Furthermore, we pass this matrix straight into the attention computation without projecting it with  $W_{V}$  and so  $U = V$  (see Remark 2 in section 3.1). This is because we wish to use the attention map  $P$  to provide contextual information to condition the similarity scores,  $e^{f(x_i, y_j)}$ , rather than the sensitive attributes. Under this setup, the attention score  $p_{ij}$  and the output  $o_{i}$  of the attention as follows:

$$
p _ {i j} = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\left(W _ {Q} t _ {i}\right) ^ {\top} \left(W _ {K} s _ {j}\right) / \rho\right), \quad o _ {i} = \sum_ {j} ^ {n} p _ {i j} e ^ {f \left(x _ {i}, y _ {j}\right)}. \tag {4}
$$

The output of the attention mechanism can therefore be interpreted as a conditionally weighted sum over the values with weights provided by the attention scores. Section 3 illustrates how these attention scores capture bias-causing interactions, and so the attention outputs are equivalently the values conditioned by their bias-causing potential, which serves the purpose of accentuating bias-reducing samples and attenuating bias-causing samples, which helps to learn debiased representations.

# 3 FAIRNESS MEETS ATTENTION

In this section, we present our Fairness-Aware (FARE) attention mechanism. FARE focuses on negative samples to reduce bias and improve the semantic content of the learned representations. The model passes the negative samples through an attention mechanism where the outputs are the linearly weighted sum of negative samples according to their bias dimension and their semantic relevance, where the weights are the attention scores (see Section 3.1). The attention matrix is then sparsified such that high bias-inducing samples are given zero attention scores (see Section 3.2), resulting in the Sparse Fairness-Aware attention (SparseFARE). FARE and SparseFARE are trained to minimize a novel Fair Attention-Contrastive (FAREContrast) loss, which incorporates FARE/SparseFARE into the Fair-InfoNCE objective in Eqn. 21 FAREContrast loss allows FARE-based methods to capture the bias-causing interactions over samples while learning good representation for downstream tasks.

# 3.1 FARE: FAIRNESS-AWARE ATTENTION

The only available data is the batch of triplets  $\{x_i, y_i, z_i\}_{i=1}^b$ , which are independently sampled from the joint distribution  $P_{XYZ}^{\otimes b}$  with  $b$  being the batch size, and we do not have access to data pairs from the conditional distribution  $P_{X|Z}P_{Y|Z}$ . Therefore, we aim to bypass the conditional sampling process from the Fair-InfoNCE objective in Eqn. 21. In particular, to transform the Fair-InfoNCE objective into an alternative version that does not require conditional sampling, we estimate the scoring function  $e^{f(x,y)}$  for  $(x,y) \sim P_{X|Z}P_{Y|Z}$  in Eqn. 21 given only  $\{x_i, y_i, z_i\}_{i=1}^b \sim P_{XYZ}^{\otimes b}$ . We do this by employing kernel density estimators to view the desired similarity score as the output of an attention mechanism, which leverages attention as kernelized non-linear similarity score (Tsai et al., 2019; Parzen, 1962; Rosenblatt, 1956). Given an anchor  $(x_i, z_i)$ , FARE estimates the similarity score between  $x_i$  and  $y \sim P_{Y|Z = z_i}$  by conditionally weighting all samples in the batch, with weights provided by learned attention scores over the protected attributes. We derive FARE below.

For any  $Z = z$ , given  $y \sim P_{Y|Z = z}$ , we estimate  $\phi(g_{\theta_Y}(y))$  by  $\mathbb{E}_{y \sim P_{Y|Z = z}}[\phi(g_{\theta_Y}(y))]$  as follows:

$$
\phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) \approx \mathbb {E} _ {y \sim P _ {Y \mid Z = z}} [ \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) ] = \int \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) P (y | z) d y = \int \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) \frac {P (y , z)}{P (z)} d y. \tag {5}
$$

We then plug Eqn. 5 into Eqn. 2 for the data pair  $(x_{i},z_{i})$  to estimate  $e^{f(x_i,y)}$  when  $y\sim P_{Y|Z = z_i}$  as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \hat {e} _ {\text {c o n d i t i o n e d}} ^ {f (x _ {i}, y)} \approx \left\langle \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right), \int \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) \frac {P (y , z)}{P (z)} d y \right\rangle_ {\mathcal {H}} \\ = \operatorname {t r} \left(\phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {\top} \int \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) \frac {P (y , z)}{P (z)} d y\right) \\ = \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {\top} \int \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) \frac {P (y , z)}{P (z)} d y. \tag {6} \\ \end{array}
$$

Here we denote the conditional estimation of the scoring function  $e^{f(x,y)}$  for  $(x,y) \sim P_{X|Z}P_{Y|Z}$  by  $\hat{e}_{\text{conditioned}}^{f(x,y)}$ .

Kernel density estimator. To estimate  $P(y,z)$  and  $P(z)$ , we employ the kernel density estimation approach (Parzen, 1962; Rosenblatt, 1956). In particular, by using the isotropic Gaussian kernel with bandwidth  $\sigma$ , we obtain the following estimators of  $P(y,z)$  and  $P(z)$ :

$$
\hat {P} _ {\sigma} (y, z) = \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \varphi_ {\sigma} \left(y - y _ {j}\right) \varphi_ {\sigma} \left(z - z _ {j}\right), \quad \hat {P} _ {\sigma} (z) = \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \varphi_ {\sigma} \left(z - z _ {j}\right), \tag {7}
$$

where  $\varphi_{\sigma}(\cdot)$  is the isotropic multivariate Gaussian density function with diagonal covariance matrix  $\sigma^2\mathbf{I}$ . Given Eqn. 6 and the kernel density estimators in Eqns. 7, we attain the following conditional

estimation of the scoring function:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \hat {e} _ {\text {c o n d i t i o n e d}} ^ {f (x _ {i}, y)} = \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {\top} \int \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)\right) \frac {\hat {P} (y , z)}{\hat {P} (z)} d y \\ = \phi (g _ {\theta_ {X}} (x _ {i})) ^ {\top} \int \phi (g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)) \frac {\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \varphi_ {\sigma} (y - y _ {j}) \varphi_ {\sigma} (z - z _ {j})}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \varphi_ {\sigma} (z - z _ {j})} d y \\ = \phi (g _ {\theta_ {X}} (x _ {i})) ^ {\top} \frac {\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \varphi_ {\sigma} (z - z _ {j}) \int \phi (g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y)) \varphi_ {\sigma} (y - y _ {j}) d y}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \varphi_ {\sigma} (z - z _ {j})} \\ = \frac {\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \left[ \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {\top} \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} \left(y _ {j}\right)\right) \right] \varphi_ {\sigma} \left(z - z _ {j}\right)}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \varphi_ {\sigma} \left(z - z _ {j}\right)}. \tag {8} \\ \end{array}
$$

Connection to Attention Mechanism. In Eqn. 8, we replace  $\varphi_{\sigma}$  by the formula of the isotropic multivariate Gaussian density function with diagonal covariance matrix  $\sigma^2\mathbf{I}$  and obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} \hat {e} _ {\mathrm {c o n d i t i o n e d}} ^ {f (x _ {i}, y)} = \frac {\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \left[ \phi (g _ {\theta_ {X}} (x _ {i})) ^ {\top} \phi (g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y _ {j})) \right] \exp \left(- \| z - z _ {j} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \exp \left(- \| z - z _ {j} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma^ {2}\right)} \\ = \frac {\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \left[ \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {\top} \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} \left(y _ {j}\right)\right) \right] \exp \left(- \left(\| z \| ^ {2} + \| z _ {j} \| ^ {2}\right) / 2 \sigma^ {2}\right) \exp \left(z ^ {\top} z _ {j} / \sigma^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \exp \left(- \left(\| z \| ^ {2} + \| z _ {j} \| ^ {2}\right) / 2 \sigma^ {2}\right) \exp \left(z ^ {\top} z _ {j} / \sigma^ {2}\right)} \tag {9} \\ \end{array}
$$

If we further assume that  $z_{j}$ ,  $j = 1,2,\ldots ,b$  are normalized and choose  $\sigma^2 = \rho$ , where  $\rho$  is the attention temperature hyperparameter in Eqn. 4, the conditionally estimated scoring function is then

$$
\begin{array}{l} \hat {e} _ {\mathrm {c o n d i t i o n e d}} ^ {f (x _ {i}, y)} = \frac {\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \left[ \phi (g _ {\theta_ {X}} (x _ {i})) ^ {\top} \phi (g _ {\theta_ {Y}} (y _ {j})) \right] \exp \left(z ^ {\top} z _ {j} / \rho\right)}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \exp \left(z ^ {\top} z _ {j} / \rho\right)} \\ = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(z ^ {\top} z _ {j} / \rho\right) \left[ \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {\top} \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} \left(y _ {j}\right)\right) \right]. \tag {10} \\ \end{array}
$$

Plugging in the observed outcome of the protected attribute,  $z = z_{i}$ , and allowing  $z_{i}$  and  $z_{j}$  to be transformed by learnable linear transformation,  $W_{Q}, W_{K}$ , the conditionally estimated similarity score  $e^{f(x_i,y)}$  when  $y \sim P_{Y|Z = z_i}$  is then given by

$$
\hat {e} _ {\text {c o n d i t i o n e d}} ^ {f (x _ {i}, y)} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \underbrace {\operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\left(W _ {Q} z _ {i}\right) ^ {\top} W _ {K} z _ {j} / \rho\right)} _ {p _ {i j}} \underbrace {\left[ \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {\top} \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} \left(y _ {j}\right)\right) \right]} _ {e ^ {f (x _ {i}, y _ {j})}}, \tag {11}
$$

which is the output of an attention mechanism with values given by the unconditioned similarity scores between samples,  $e^{f(x_i,y_j)}$ , and attention scores  $p_{ij}$  computed over the protected attributes  $(z_i,z_j)$ . Thus, the similarity scoring function estimation between  $x_i$  and  $y \sim P_{Y|Z = z_i}$  can be approximated by an attention output. We summarize this new result in the following proposition.

Proposition 1 (Conditional Estimation of  $e^{f(x_i,y)}$  when  $y \sim P_{Y|Z = z_i}$ ). Given  $\{x_i, y_i, z_i\}_{i=1}^b \sim P_{XYZ}^{\otimes b}$ , the finite-sample estimation of  $e^{f(x_i,y)}$  is  $\sum_{j=1}^b \text{softmax}((W_Qz_i)^\top W_Kz_j / \rho)\left[\phi(g_{\theta_X}(x_i))^\top \phi(g_{\theta_Y}(y_j))\right]$ , which is the output of an attention mechanism.

Hence, the attention scores  $p_{ij}$  condition the similarity scores  $e^{f(x_i,y_j)}$ , i.e., for any data pair  $(x_i,y_j)$ , their similarity is accentuated/attenuated depending on the attention between the protected attributes  $(z_i,z_j)$ . At a high level, when  $z_i$  is dissimilar from  $z_j$ ,  $x_j$  is likely to cause a bias in the learned representations, and we expect the attention mechanism to divert its focus from that sample. Conversely, when  $z_i$  is similar to  $z_j$ ,  $x_j$  is likely to reduce the bias in the learned representations, and the attention mechanism should place more focus on that sample. However, rather than specifying

the extent to which similarities over the bias dimension should mask out samples via a pre-defined kernel as in Tsai et al. (2022), we allow the attention mechanism to learn this metric given the task. This flexibility allows the model to focus on samples that are bias-reducing and shift its emphasis away from samples that are bias-causing while simultaneously adapting towards the overall task of learning semantically meaningful representations.

We are now ready to give a full definition of FARE.

Definition 1 (Fairness-Aware Attention). Fairness-aware attention (FARE) is an attention mechanism that computes the finite-sample estimation of the similarity scores  $e^{f(x_i, y)}$  when  $y \sim P_{Y|Z = z_i}$  for  $i = 1, 2, \ldots, b$  with  $b$  being the batch size. Given  $\{(x_i, y_i, z_i)\}_{i=1}^b \sim P_{XYZ}^{\otimes b}$ , FARE is defined as

$$
F A R E \left(\left\{\left(x _ {i}, y _ {i}, z _ {i}\right) \right\} _ {i = 1} ^ {b}\right) = \hat {e} _ {\text {c o n d i t i o n e d}} ^ {f \left(x _ {i}, y\right)} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {b} \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\left(W _ {Q} z _ {i}\right) ^ {\top} W _ {K} z _ {j} / \rho\right) \left[ \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {\top} \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} \left(y _ {j}\right)\right) \right] \tag {12}
$$

FARE estimates the similarity between any given anchor and negative sample, where the similarity is conditioned according to the protected attribute and the extent to which any sample is likely to bias the representations. By focusing attention on samples according to their bias-inducing characteristics, FARE is able to learn fair representations.

Remark 1. In Proposition 1, the attention score  $p_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left((W_Qz_i)^\top W_Kz_j / \rho\right)$ ,  $i,j = 1,2,\ldots,b$ , provides a context to estimate the similarity score between  $x_i$  and  $y \sim P_{Y|Z=z_i}$ , thus allowing FARE to attain a contextual representation. It has been shown that the ability of the attention mechanism to capture rich and diverse contextual representation is key to the impressive performance of recent deep learning models, including transformers and graph neural networks (Tenney et al., 2019; Vig & Belinkov, 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019; Hewitt & Liang, 2019).

Remark 2. We do not include a learnable value transformation matrix  $W_V$  for the values. Rather we pass the unconditioned similarity scores,  $e^{f(x_i, y_i)}$ , straight into the attention mechanism. This is because a transformation  $W_V$  would allow the optimization procedure to take a shortcut and avoid minimizing the objective loss by just sending the value weights to infinity, obtaining 0 loss and thereby preventing the encoder from learning useful representations. More details are given in Appendix E.

# 3.2 SPARSEFAIRE: SPARSE FAIRNESS-AWARE ATTENTION

In the previous section, we proposed the use of attention for debiasing representations, we now discuss the role of sparsification towards this goal. If we have prior knowledge on the proportion of samples that need not be considered at all since they are relatively extreme in the bias dimension, then we can discard those samples before computing attention. For example, if color is the protected attribute, then samples with opposing colors such as black/white may be considered extreme in the bias dimension relative to each other. This allows the attention mechanism to be more efficient and debias more aggressively as samples can be given an attention score of exactly 0. We implement the sparse fairness-aware attention (SparseFARE) via locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) (Kitaev et al. (2020)).

Locality-Sensitive Hashing. A hashing scheme is locality-sensitive if for all vectors,  $z$ , assigned hashes  $h(z)$ , similar vectors are assigned the same hash with high probability and dissimilar vectors are assigned the same hash with low probability (Kitaev et al., 2020). We follow the LSH scheme in (Andoni et al., 2015), which employs random projections  $R \in \mathbb{R}^{d_z \times b/2}$  where  $[R]_{ij} \sim N(0,1)$  and assigns hashes by  $h(z) = \mathrm{argmax}(\mathrm{concat}(zR, -zR))$ .

Locality-Sensitive Hashing Attention for Fairness. The basis of the debiasing scheme is the assumption that for anchor  $(x_{i},z_{i})$  and negative sample  $(y_{j},z_{j})$ ,  $y_{j}$  is likely to increase the bias of the representations when  $z_{i}$  is dissimilar to  $z_{j}$ . If we determine some threshold for ignoring  $(y_{j},z_{j})$  when  $z_{i}$  and  $z_{j}$  are sufficiently dissimilar, then we can leverage the LSH scheme to ensure with high probability that  $h(y_{j}) \neq h(x_{i})$ . Subsequently, if we only permit attention to be calculated within hash buckets (or potentially within hash buckets and across adjacent buckets), we should ignore samples at the relative extremes of  $Z$  with high probability to speed up our fairness mechanism and perform more aggressive debiasing by discarding extreme bias-causing samples.

Figure 1: Sparse Fair-Aware Attention (SparseFARE) using LSH to discard bias-causing samples. Relative to the anchor's protected attribute status (blue), the fairness-aware attention (FARE) first groups the samples according to their bias attribute and discards any samples that are likely to be highly bias-inducing (brown). Attention scores between similar and bias-reducing samples are then computed.

For index  $i$  of a given query  $q_{i}$ , we denote the attention support as  $S_{i} = \{j:h(k_{j}) = h(k_{i})\}$ , which is the set of keys hashed to the same bucket and therefore take part in the attention computation with  $q_{i}$ . Figure 1 illustrates this scheme.

SparseFARE Formalization. Given the LSH scheme for fairness, we now provide the full formulation of the SparseFARE.

Definition 2 (Fairness-Aware Attention with Sparsification). Sparse fairness-aware attention (SparseFARE) is a variant of FARE in which the attention map over protected attributes is sparsified by removing entries that are highly bias-inducing. Given  $\{(x_i, y_i, z_i)\}_{i=1}^b \sim P_{XYZ}^{\otimes b}$ , SparseFARE computes the finite-sample estimation of the similarity scores  $e^{f(x_i, y)}$  when  $y \sim P_{Y|Z = z_i}$  for  $i = 1, 2, \ldots, b$  with  $b$  being the batch size as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} S p a r s e F A R E (\{(x _ {i}, y _ {i}, z _ {i}) \} _ {i = 1} ^ {b}) = \hat {e} _ {\text {c o n d i t i o n e d}} ^ {f (x _ {i}, y)} \\ = \sum_ {j \in S _ {i}} \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\left(W _ {Q} z _ {i}\right) ^ {\top} W _ {K} z _ {j} / \rho - m (j, S _ {i})\right) \left[ \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {X}} \left(x _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {\top} \phi \left(g _ {\theta_ {Y}} \left(y _ {j}\right)\right) \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $S_{i} = \{j:h(z_{j}) = h(z_{i})\}$  is the attention support of  $i$  and  $m(j,S_i) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\infty & if j\notin S_i\\ 0 & otherwise \end{array} \right.$ .

# 3.3 FARECONTRAST: FAIR ATTENTION-CONTRASTIVE CRITERION FOR CONTRASTIVE LEARNING

We now present the Fair Attention-Contrastive (FAReContrast) criterion for fair contrastive learning with FARE. We obtain FAREContrast by replacing the summation over negative samples in the FairInfoNCE in Eqn. 21 with the output of FARE. FAREContrast is then defined as

$$
\sup  _ {f} \mathbb {E} _ {\left\{\left(x _ {i}, y _ {i}, z _ {i}\right) \right\} _ {i = 1} ^ {b} \sim P _ {X Y Z} ^ {\otimes b}} \left[ \log \frac {e ^ {f \left(x _ {i} , y _ {i}\right)}}{e ^ {f \left(x _ {i} , y _ {i}\right)} + \operatorname {F A R E} \left(\left\{\left(x _ {i} , y _ {i} , z _ {i}\right) \right\} _ {i = 1} ^ {b}\right)} \right]. \tag {13}
$$

The goal of the FAREContrast criterion is to adapt the Fair-InfoNCE objective such that we avoid conditional sampling. We do this because our FARE attention mechanism avoids conditional sampling of negative pairs by using attention to consider the whole batch and selectively weight samples according to their protected attribute status, in this way focussing on bias-reducing samples for contrasting. Hence we only consider  $\{(x_i,y_i,z_i)\}_{i = 1}^b\sim P_{XYZ}^{\otimes b}$ . Furthermore, we only need FARE for negative samples since only the negatives need to be conditioned for contrasting with the positive pair. The positive pair will necessarily be identical in the bias-dimension as we do not perform augmentations that change the protected attribute. Our method debiases representations by then

Table 1: Results on colorMNIST. Bias removal is measured by MSE, where high MSE indicates more color information has been removed from the learned representations.

only showing the positive pair negative samples that have similar protected attribute status, such that the protected information is not used to distinguish samples. Hence FAREContrast is obtained by replacing the summation over negative samples in Fair-InfoNCE with FARE.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we numerically justify the advantage of FARE in learning debiased and semantically meaningful representations over the baseline methods including InfoNCE (Oord et al., 2018), FairInfoNCE (Tsai et al., 2022), SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) and the conditional contrastive learning with kernel model (CCLK) (Tsai et al., 2022). We aim to show that: (i) our methods are able to learn representations with sensitive information removed, and (ii) our learned representations maintain relevant semantic content.

Datasets. We conduct our experiments on the ColorMNIST dataset (Tsai et al., 2022) and CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2018). ColorMNIST contains 60,000 handwritten digits with a continuous RGB color randomly assigned to the background of each digit. The color is taken to be the protected attribute. CelebA contains 202,599 images of celebrities with 40 binary annotations indicating hair color, gender, and many other attributes. We take Attractive as target and Young and Male as sensitive attributes simultaneously.

Evaluation Protocol. To evaluate representation quality, we adopt the common technique of freezing the encoder and training a linear classifier using the true labels on the encoded representations and measuring accuracy. To evaluate bias removal in the continuous setting of ColorMNIST, we follow the protocol of Tsai et al. (2022) and train a linear layer on the encoded representations to predict each samples' protected attribute. We use the mean squared error (MSE) of predicting the color as a proxy for the extent to which the sensitive information has been removed, where higher loss indicates more sensitive information has been removed. For CelebA, we measure fairness in this binary scenario using the common metric Equalized Odds (Hardt et al., 2016) where a lower score indicates a fairer model. Additional empirical results and experimental details are provided in the Appendix A.

(↑)</td><td>EO (↓)</td></tr><tr><td>SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020)</td><td>77.7</td><td>39.6</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Kernel-based Models (Tsai et al., 2022)</td></tr><tr><td>CCLK-Cosine</td><td>70.2</td><td>22.4</td></tr><tr><td>CCLK-RBF</td><td>69.9</td><td>21.8</td></tr><tr><td>CCLK-Linear</td><td>71.1</td><td>21.1</td></tr><tr><td>CCLK-Polynomial</td><td>71.0</td><td>20.8</td></tr><tr><td>CCLK-Laplacian</td><td>70.0</td><td>20.8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Attention-based Models</td></tr><tr><td>FARE (ours)</td><td>73.7</td><td>23.5</td></tr><tr><td>SparseFARE (ours)</td><td>70.4</td><td>18.7</td></tr></table>

Results. Table 1 shows experimental results on the colorMNIST dataset. Our FARE and SparseFARE outperform the baseline methods in terms of bias removal while achieving comparable and better top-1 accuracies. In particular, taking accuracy and bias removal together, SparseFARE is able to weakly Pareto dominate all comparative models, learning substantially less biased representations without compromising downstream accuracy.

Table 2 shows the results of the attention-based models on the CelebA dataset. We find that SimCLR achieves highest accuracy while SparseFARE achieves the best fairness. Given that Young and Male are both highly correlated with Attractive, it is intuitive that SimCLR attains top accuracy, as SimCLR does not attempt to remove information relating to these two attributes and so is able to leverage the correlation between attributes and target to make more accurate predictions. SparseFARE Pareto dominates all kernel models in terms of fairness and accuracy except for Linear and Polynomial, which achieve marginally higher accuracy. SparseFARE nonetheless attains a better fairness-accuracy tradeoff curve than these two kernels and so for any given level of accuracy, sparseFARE obtains fairer results (see Appendix D).

Efficiency Analysis. Our attention-based methods are more computationally efficient than the kernel-based baselines. CCLK, by requiring matrix inversion, costs  $O(b^{3})$ , while FARE costs  $O(b^{2})$  and SparseFARE costs  $O(b\log (b))$  (see Appendix B).

# 5 RELATED WORK

The majority of the literature on fair contrastive learning has considered only binary protected attributes (Park et al. (2022); Chai & Wang (2022)). With binary protected attributes, debiasing can be achieved by forming positive pairs as samples with opposing bias classes (Cheng et al. (2021); Hong & Yang (2021); Shen et al. (2021)). Another approach is to form positive pairs by using auxiliary models to learn optimal augmentations that obfuscate the bias class of the sample (Ling et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2022)). This paper proposes an attention-based framework to deal with more general notions of fairness that accommodate high cardinality or continuous protected attributes, whereby we learn semantically meaningful representations such that the protected information has been removed. Tsai et al. (2022) also consider this setting and use kernel similarity functions to weigh negative samples along the bias dimension for contrastive learning. Our approach differs from their method by using an attention mechanism to learn the bias-causing interactions among samples without specifying a pre-defined kernel.

Our paper also connects to the growing literature surrounding kernel and attention. Most existing work has looked at decomposing the attention computation and enriching or explaining this mechanism by interpreting it as a kernel function. Tsai et al. (2019) propose novel attention mechanisms based on differing kernel functions and Song et al. (2021) propose enriching attention with implicit kernel estimation, while Tao et al. (2023) explain attention through nonlinear SVD of asymmetric kernels and Wright & Gonzalez (2021) view attention as infinite-dimensional non-mercer binary kernel machines. In contrast, our work derives an attention mechanism from a kernel-based method to learn a task-specific similarity metric that can capture the bias-interaction structure and assist the training procedure to learn better-debiased representations.

Lastly, sparse attention has been studied in the context of efficient transformers. Sparsity in attention mechanisms has been implemented via sparse factorization (Child et al.), via local windows (Beltagy et al. (2020)), and via locality-sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al. (2020)). While our work leverages locality-sensitive hashing, it does not do so merely to save on computational costs. Rather, locality-sensitive hashing supplements the debiasing scheme by sparsifying the entries of the attention map corresponding to extreme bias-inducing samples. To the best of our knowledge, ours is among the early works of using locality-sensitive hashing, or sparsification in general, for learning fair representations.

# 6 CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we present the Fairness-Aware (FARE) attention mechanism, the Sparse Fairness-Aware (SparseFARE) attention mechanism, and the corresponding Fair Attention-Contrastive (Fare-Contrast) criterion for learning fair representations. We address the difficult problem setting of high cardinality or continuous protected attributes and show that FARE and SparseFARE are able to learn a similarity metric over protected attributes that captures the bias-causing interactions among samples, while also focusing on bias-causing samples that are confounding the model. As a result, our attention-based approach is able to learn debiased and semantically meaningful representations. A limitation of our method is that they only capture one attention pattern between protected attributes, thereby providing only one single context to condition the similarity scores. It is indeed necessary to extend FARE and SparseFARE to a multi-head attention setting to capture more diverse contextual representations. We leave this interesting research direction as future work.
