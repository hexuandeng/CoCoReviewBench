# Abstract

Linear regression is one of the simplest machine learning tasks. Despite much work, differentially private linear regression still lacks effective algorithms. We propose a new approach based on a multivariate extension of the Theil-Sen estimator. The theoretical advantage of our approach is that we do not directly rely on noise addition, which requires bounding the sensitivity. Instead we compute differentially private medians as a subroutine, which are more robust. We also show experimentally that our approach compares favourably to prior work.

# 1 Introduction

9 Background & Motivation Differential Privacy [DMNS06] is a standard for ensuring that the output (i.e., trained model) of a machine learning system does not leak sensitive details about its input (i.e., training data, which could contain private information about individual people). Differentially private machine learning has been the topic of considerable research, both theoretical and empirical, and is also used in practice [MT22].

Arguably, the simplest machine learning task is linear regression. That is, we are given a dataset  $(x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),\dots ,(x_{n},y_{n})\in \mathbb{R}^{d}\times \mathbb{R}$  and our goal is to fit a linear model of the form  $y_{i}\approx$ $\langle \theta ,x_i\rangle$  for some  $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$  . More precisely, ordinary least squares linear regression minimizes the squared error  $\sum_{i}^{n}(\langle \theta ,x_{i}\rangle -y_{i})^{2}$  . This objective corresponds to assuming that the errors (i.e., the deviations from a perfect linear relationship) are Gaussian. This objective is particularly nice, as it has a closed-form solution:  $\theta = (X^T X)^{-1}X^T y$  , where  $X = (x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n})^{T}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$  and  $y = (y_{1},y_{2},\ldots ,y_{n})^{T}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$

Given the practical importance of linear regression, there has been a lot of work on differentially private linear regression. (We discuss the related work in more detail in Section 1.3.) However, these prior works all suffer from the same limitation: To guarantee differential privacy they add noise to some quantity - either to the raw data  $X$  and  $y$ , to the sufficient statistics  $X^T X$  and  $X^T y$ , or to the gradients  $\sum_{i} x_i \cdot (\langle \theta, x_i \rangle - y_i)$  encountered when optimizing the least squares objective. This noise addition approach requires bounding the sensitivity, which essentially means we must provide a priori bounds on  $\| x_i \|$  and  $|y_i|$  or, rather, we must scale/clip the quantities of interest to enforce these bounds. The clipping hyperparameter induces a harsh privacy-utility tradeoff: If the bounds are loose, we must add more noise than necessary. If the bounds are too tight, the clipping distorts the data. This raises the question: Can we perform differentially private linear regression in a way that is (nearly) agnostic to the sensitivity?

Inspiration for Our Approach To gain some intuition, consider the even simpler task of mean estimation, i.e., computing the average  $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}x_{i}$ . Here we face the same difficulty in terms of clipping the data to bound the sensitivity. Numerous approaches to mean estimation have been studied [e.g.: KV17; BS19; KSU20; BDKU20; LKKO21; LKO21].

Gaussian Mechanism Regressor DP-GD Regressor

One way to sidestep this sensitivity issue is to look at the median instead of the mean. Under reasonable distributional assumptions, the median is a good approximation to the mean, with the advantage that the sensitivity of the median is usually much lower than the mean. Thus the median can be a good tool for differentially private mean estimation.  
The key innovation of our approach is to carry this median-instead-of-mean idea over to the setting of linear regression. But this is far from straightforward – we are interested in the multidimensional setting and even defining a multi-dimensional median is nontrivial.  
We draw further inspiration from the literature on robust statistics – intuitively, the median is a robust replacement for the mean. In particular, the Theil-Sen estimator [The50; Sen68] uses the median to perform robust simple linear regression (i.e.,  $d = 1$ ). Indeed, a differentially private Theil-Sen estimator has been studied by Dwork and Lei [DL09] and Alabi, McMillan, Sarathy, Smith, and Vadhan [AMSSV22]. We extend this to multivariate linear regression using a variant of the (non-private) approach of Dang, Peng, Wang, and Zhang [DPWZ08].

# 1.1 Our Algorithm

Our private linear regression algorithm is described in Algorithm 1. We proceed with some remarks about our algorithm.

The high-level idea of the Theil-Sen estimator is that, rather than trying to solve the global objective (i.e.,  $\min_{\theta}\sum_{i}^{n}(\langle \theta ,x_{i}\rangle -y_{i})^{2})$  , we solve  $\ell \cdot m$  subproblems and then combine these solutions into a single solution via a median. Each subproblem consists of a subset of  $d$  out of  $n$  of the input points (which is enough to uniquely specify the weights  $\theta_{j,k}\in \mathbb{R}^d$  , assuming the  $x_{i}$  s are linearly independent).

The standard Theil-Sen estimator considers all  $\binom{n}{d}$  possible subproblems. This is computationally prohibitive for realistic values of  $n$  and  $d$ ; hence we randomly select a subset of  $\ell \cdot m$  subproblems. We will consider small numbers of repetitions, such as  $\ell = 1$ .

From a differential privacy perspective, changing one input point  $(x_{i},y_{i})$  can change  $\ell$  subproblems and hence  $\ell$  elements of  $\Theta$ . If our method for computing the median is  $(\varepsilon/\ell)$ -differentially private with respect to changing one element of  $\Theta$ , then by group privacy it is  $\varepsilon$ -differentially private with respect to changing one input point  $(x_{i},y_{i})$ , as required. This is a straightforward extension of the sample-and-aggregate framework [NRS07].

There are many ways to defuse and compute a multivariate median (even non-privately). For simplicity, we compute a marginal median: we simply compute the univariate median for each coordinate - i.e.,  $\hat{\theta}_i\approx \underset {\theta \in \Theta}{\mathrm{median}}\theta_i$  for each  $i\in [d]$ . Privately approximating the univariate median is a well-studied problem [NRS07; Smi08; DL09; Smi11; BNSV15; KV17; FS18; KLSU19; BS19; AD20; KLMNS20; GJK21; ABEC22]. We compute the median by a simple application of the exponential mechanism [MT07a]; although this doesn't achieve optimal asymptotic bounds, it performs remarkably well in practice. To be specific, following Smith [Smi11] and Feldman and Steinke [FS18], we sample each coordinate  $\hat{\theta}_i$  from a probability distribution that decays exponentially with how far away it is from the median. This ensures that the overall algorithm satisfies  $\varepsilon$ -DP and is

accurate under reasonable conditions. Each coordinate  $\hat{\theta}_i$  is computed in a way that is  $\varepsilon /d$ -DP. Composing over the  $d$  coordinates yields the final  $\varepsilon$ -DP bound.

Note that we restrict the range of the coordinates to  $\mathcal{R} \subset \mathbb{R}$ . This can either be an interval (e.g.,  $\mathcal{R} = [a, b]$ ) or a discrete set (e.g.,  $\mathcal{R} = \{a + (b - a) \cdot (i - 1) / r : i \in [r + 1]\}$ ). For the exponential mechanism to be well-defined, it is necessary to ensure that  $\mathcal{R}$  has finite measure (i.e., a bounded interval with Lebesgue measure or a finite set with the counting measure). Regardless of our choice of algorithm, it is known that some such restriction is necessary in the worst case [ALMM19]. In most cases, the exact choice of  $\mathcal{R}$  is not particularly critical for our algorithm, so we do not dwell on this issue.

There is a subtlety of our choice of loss function for the exponential mechanism: If  $\hat{\theta}_i \neq \theta_i$  for all  $\theta \in \Theta$ , we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left. \right. \max  \left\{\left|\left\{\theta \in \Theta : \theta_ {i} <   \hat {\theta} _ {i} \right\}\right|, \left|\left\{\theta \in \Theta : \theta_ {i} > \hat {\theta} _ {i} \right\}\right|\right\} = \\ \left. \right. \max  \left\{\left|\left\{\theta \in \Theta : \theta_ {i} <   \hat {\theta} _ {i} \right\}\right|, | \Theta | - \left|\left\{\theta \in \Theta : \theta_ {i} <   \hat {\theta} _ {i} \right\}\right|\right\} \\ = \left| \left| \left\{\theta \in \Theta : \theta_ {i} <   \hat {\theta} _ {i} \right\} \right| - \frac {1}{2} | \Theta | \right| + \frac {1}{2} | \Theta |. \\ \end{array}
$$

The final expression is more natural than the first expression. The quantity  $\left|\left\{\theta \in \Theta : \theta_i < \hat{\theta}_i\right\}\right|$  gives the rank (i.e., rescaled quantile) of the value  $\hat{\theta}_i$  in the multiset  $\{\theta_i : \theta \in \Theta\}$ . The true median has rank  $\frac{1}{2} |\Theta|$ , so the loss measures how far the rank is from this ideal. When everything has a continuous distribution, the above equality between the expressions holds with probability 1. However, if we have a discrete distribution (such as when  $\mathcal{R}$  is a discrete set), the above equality does not hold. Consider the extreme case where the multiset  $\Theta$  consists of a single point  $\theta^*$  repeated many times. When  $\hat{\theta}_i = \theta_i^*$ , our loss function takes value 0 and, for  $\hat{\theta}_i \neq \theta_i^*$ , our loss function takes value  $|\Theta|$ . In contrast, the final expression above would yield a constant function taking value  $|\Theta|$  everywhere. Thus our loss function performs better in the discrete case.

# 1.2 Our Results

We provide a theoretical privacy and utility analysis of our algorithm, as well as an experimental evaluation of our algorithm. Our theoretical guarantee is helpful to build understanding. However, our experimental results give a clearer comparison to prior work. See Figure 1 for an experimental comparison of algorithms. Next we state the main accuracy result:

Theorem 1.1 (Main Result). For any  $\tilde{\varepsilon},\tilde{\delta} >0$  and  $n,d,r\in \mathbb{N}$ , Algorithm 1 with appropriate settings of parameters provides  $(\tilde{\varepsilon},\tilde{\delta})$ -DP and the following accuracy guarantee.

Fix  $\theta^{*} \in [-r, + r]^{d}$  and  $\sigma > 0$ . Assume the inputs  $(x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),\ldots ,(x_{n},y_{n}) \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \times \mathbb{R}$  are drawn i.i.d. as follows. Independently for each  $i \in [n]$ , we have  $x_{i} \gets \mathcal{N}(0,I)$  and then, conditioned on  $x_{i}$ , we have  $y_{i} \gets \mathcal{N}(\langle \theta^{*},x_{i}\rangle,\sigma^{2})$ .

If  $\hat{\theta}$  is the output of Algorithm 1 with the above inputs and parameters, then, for all  $\beta >0$ , we have

$$
\mathbb {P} \left[ \| \hat {\theta} - \theta^ {*} \| _ {\infty} \leq \sigma \cdot O \left(\frac {d \cdot \sqrt {d \cdot \log (1 / \tilde {\delta})}}{\tilde {\varepsilon} n} \log \left(\frac {d r}{\beta}\right) + \sqrt {\frac {d \cdot \log (d / \beta)}{n}}\right) + \frac {1}{r} \right] \geq 1 - \beta .
$$

We now make some remarks about the meaning of our theoretical result.

Pure DP vs. Approximate DP Algorithm 1 offers both pure and approximate DP guarantees (and concentrated DP); see Proposition A.1 for details. The parameter  $\varepsilon$  of the algorithm corresponds to the pure  $(\varepsilon, 0)$ -DP guarantee. In high dimensional settings (i.e., large  $d$ ), we can apply advanced composition results to obtain better guarantees. Specifically, the approximate  $(\tilde{\varepsilon}, \tilde{\delta})$ -DP guarantee of Theorem 1.1 is achieved by setting  $\varepsilon \approx \tilde{\varepsilon} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{d}{\log(1 / \tilde{\delta})}}$ .

Accuracy Guarantee The error bound of Theorem 1.1 has three terms:  $\sigma \cdot \frac{d}{\varepsilon m} \log \left( \frac{dr}{\beta} \right)$  is the error due to privacy;  $\sigma \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\log(d / \beta)}{m}}$  is the non-private statistical estimation error (a.k.a. generalization error); and  $\frac{1}{r}$  is the error from rounding to the discrete set  $\mathcal{R}$  of size  $O(r^2)$ .

Our accuracy guarantee bounds  $\| \hat{\theta} - \theta^{*} \|_{\infty}$ . This is particularly useful if our goal is to estimate some parameter  $\theta_{i}^{*}$ , as it provides a confidence interval. We can of course also use this to bound the Euclidean norm:  $\| \hat{\theta} - \theta^{*} \|_{2} \leq \sqrt{d} \cdot \| \hat{\theta} - \theta^{*} \|_{\infty}$ . It is also common to provide bounds on the mean squared error. Under our distributional assumptions, this is equivalent to bounding the Euclidean norm: If  $x \gets \mathcal{N}(0, I)$  and  $y \gets \mathcal{N}(\langle \theta^{*}, x \rangle, \sigma^{2})$ , then, for all  $\hat{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \left(\langle \hat {\theta}, x \rangle - y\right) ^ {2} \right] = \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(\langle \theta^ {*}, x \rangle - y\right) ^ {2} \right] + \| \hat {\theta} - \theta^ {*} \| _ {2} ^ {2} = \sigma^ {2} + \| \hat {\theta} - \theta^ {*} \| _ {2} ^ {2}.
$$

Distributional Assumptions We emphasize that our privacy guarantee is worst-case and the distributional assumptions are only for the accuracy analysis. Thus the maxim "all models are wrong, but some are useful" (attributed to George Box) applies. That is, we don't expect real data to perfectly follow a Gaussian distribution. Our algorithm still works even if these assumptions fail, but we believe that the theorem is a useful indication that our algorithm provides useful accuracy.

There is also some flexibility in the Gaussian assumption: If the  $x_{i}$ 's are drawn from  $\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$  instead of  $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$  then we can apply a transformation  $(x_{i}, y_{i}) \mapsto (\Sigma^{-1/2} x_{i}, y_{i})$  to make the distribution of  $x_{i}$ 's spherical, run our algorithm to obtain  $\hat{\theta}$ , and then map this back to a solution to the original problem  $\Sigma^{-1/2} \hat{\theta}$ .

Our assumption that the data comes from a multivariate Gaussian is reasonably standard. Assuming that  $\| \theta^{*} \|_{\infty} \leq r$  is less standard. In the non-private setting we don't need to make any assumption on  $\theta^{*}$ , but it is necessary in the private case [ALMM19]. Note that we can arbitrarily rescale this constraint: If instead we assume  $\| \theta^{*} - \theta^{0} \|_{\infty} \leq b \cdot r$  for some  $b > 0$ , then we can simply transform the data  $(x_{i}, y_{i}) \mapsto (x_{i}, \frac{1}{b}(y_{i} - \langle \theta^{0}, x_{i} \rangle))$ , run our algorithm to obtain  $\hat{\theta} \in [-r, r]^{d}$ , and then map this back to a solution to the original problem  $b \cdot \hat{\theta} + \theta^{0}$ . The accuracy guarantee will be rescaled accordingly. Similarly, the infinity norm can be replaced by the Euclidean norm by transforming the problem with a random unitary matrix [e.g., KLS21, §4.2].

Parameters The sample size  $n$ , dimension  $d$ , noise variance  $\sigma^2$ , and privacy parameters  $\tilde{\varepsilon}$  and  $\tilde{\delta}$  are all standard parameters. The only non-standard parameter of Theorem 1.1 is  $r$ . This determines both the size and granularity of the restricted range  $\mathcal{R}$  in Algorithm 1. This parameter should be thought of as capturing how uncertain we are about  $\theta^{*} \in [-r, r]^{d}$  and how precise our final answer should be - i.e., the granularity of  $\mathcal{R}$  is  $1 / r$  (which should ideally scale with  $\sigma$ ). Theorem 1.1 runs Algorithm 1 with  $\ell = 1$ .

# 1.3 Related Work

Linear regression has been well studied in the non-private setting; we do not discuss this setting except to mention the connection to robust statistics. Robust statistics seeks to develop estimators that are resistant to a small fraction of the dataset being corrupted. This kind of robustness turns out to be useful for designing DP algorithms [NRS07; DL09; BS19] and our work extends this connection. In particular, the standard approach to linear regression is not robust, which led to the development of the robust Theil-Sen estimator [The50; Sen68] and its multivariate extension [DPWZ08], which are the basis for our work.

DP linear regression has also been well-studied. Most similar to our work is that of Alabi, McMillan, Sarathy, Smith, and Vadhan [AMSSV22], which studies the Theil-Sen estimator in the setting of simple linear regression. This is essentially our algorithm restricted to the case of  $d = 1$ , although they also add a constant intercept, i.e., an affine relationship  $y \approx \theta x + b$ . Adding an intercept is equivalent to adding an extra feature to  $x$  that is always 1 and adding a corresponding dimension to  $\theta$ . Dwork and Lei [DL09] propose two DP robust regression methods. The first is, like ours, based on the Theil-Sen estimator, although with a different method for computing the median. The second changes the loss function to one with bounded gradients, namely  $\sum_{i}^{n}|\langle \theta ,x_i\rangle -y_i| / \| x_i\| _2$ , and

analyzes the robustness of the solution to this new problem. Unfortunately, Dwork and Lei [DL09] provide very limited theoretical results and no experimental results for us to compare against.

Our algorithmic approach of analyzing several subproblems and then privately combining the answers is based on the sample-and-aggregate framework of Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith [NRS07]. Similar algorithms have appeared in other works. In particular, Feldman and Steinke [FS18] use a median-of-means approach to compute a univariate mean. Singhal and Steinke [SS21] propose an algorithm that is similar to ours, but for the different (but related) problem of finding a low-dimensional subspace that captures the data.

A natural approach to DP linear regression is to apply general-purpose optimization tools to the objective function  $f(\theta) = \sum_{i}^{n} (\langle \theta, x_i \rangle - y_i)^2$ . Noisy gradient descent (DP-GD) [SCS13; BST14; ACGMMTZ16] is a widely-used tool for private optimization. It adds noise to the gradients  $\nabla f(\theta) = 2\sum_{i}^{n} (\langle \theta, x_i \rangle - y) \cdot x_i$  encountered during the optimization procedure. To ensure that the gradients are bounded, we must clip them before adding noise. That is, we add noise to  $\min \{1, c / \| \nabla f(\theta) \| \} \cdot \nabla f(\theta)$  instead of  $\nabla f(\theta)$ , which could be unbounded. This approach works remarkably well, but it requires carefully setting the clipping parameter  $c$ . The larger  $c$  is, the more noise we add. But if  $c$  is too small we distort the gradients and the optimization procedure may not even converge in time. We use this approach as a comparison point in our experiments, but we find that setting the parameters  $(c, \text{number of steps}, \text{and learning rate})$  to be highly non-trivial. In an unpublished work, Varshney, Jain, and Thakurta [VJT22] propose a variant of DP-GD where the clipping parameter  $c$  is chosen in a data-dependent manner at each step of the optimization. They show that this adaptive clipping can achieve asymptotically optimal results. Kamath, Li, Singhal, and Ullman [KLSU19] apply a similar adaptive clipping approach to learning the parameters of a Gaussian distribution; linear regression can be reduced to this task [MKFI22]. Another general-purpose optimization tool is Objective Perturbation [CMS11], which was applied to linear regression by Wang [Wan18], but objective perturbation requires stronger assumptions than DP-GD (such as convexity ans smoothness) which means we also need additional assumptions to apply it to linear regression. Finally, we mention that, under the right assumptions, it is possible to apply the exponential mechanism [MT07b] to the linear regression objective, which can be viewed as a form of bayesian sampling [Wan18].

Since there is a closed-form solution in the non-private setting – namely,  $\hat{\theta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$  where each example  $(x_i, y_i)$  is a row of  $X$  and the corresponding row of  $y$  – another natural approach to the problem is to perturb  $X^T X = \sum_{i}^{n} x_i x_i^T \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  and  $X^T y = \sum_{i}^{n} y_i x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , which are known as the sufficient statistics. This requires us to bound the sensitivity of these terms, which boils down to bounding  $\| x_i \|_2$  and  $|y_i|$ . For our experimental comparison, we add Gaussian noise to both  $X^T X$  and  $X^T y$ . One downside of adding Gaussian noise to  $X^T X$  is that it may cease to be positive semidefinite. Thus it has also been suggested to add noise drawn from a Wishart distribution [She19]. (We note that analyzing Wishart noise is difficult and incorrect analyses of this approach have been published [JXZ16; IS16].) Wang [Wan18] also studied an adaptive form of sufficient statistics perturbation.

It is also possible to add noise directly to the data [DTTZ14; She17; She19]. That is, we perturb  $X$  and  $y$ , which also requires bounding  $\| x_i\|_2$  and  $|y_i|$ . This tends to yield worse results than perturbing the sufficient statistics. Intuitively, this approach adds noise to each of the  $n$  rows of  $X$  and  $y$ , so the amount of noise grows with  $n$ . In contrast, the amount of noise added to  $X^T X$  and  $X^T y$  does not grow with  $n$ . However, adding noise to the data is desirable if we are in the setting of local DP [KLNRS11]; our results are for the central DP setting.

As mentioned earlier, of the key advantages of our algorithm over the optimization and perturbation approaches is that we do not need to clip or bound the data  $(x_{i},y_{i})$ , which can be quite detrimental to accuracy in practice. Our use of a median-based algorithm means we have much lower sensitivity to these bounds (logarithmic instead of linear).

# 2 Experiments

We now perform an empirical evaluation of our algorithm using synthetic data. We compare to state-of-the-art approaches and, since our algorithm has several moving parts, we also consider variants of our algorithm.

# 2.1 Synthetic Data

We perform our experiments using synthetic data, as this allows us to be precise about what assumptions we are and are not making. In all these experiments  $\theta$  is sampled uniformly from  $[-1,1]^d$ , features  $x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}$  are sampled independently and uniformly from  $[0,1]^{d}$  and each  $y_{i}$  is sampled from  $\mathcal{N}(\langle \theta ,x_i\rangle ,\sigma^2)$  independently (conditioned on  $x_{i}$ ), where  $\sigma = 0.1$ .

Note that the features are sampled from a bounded distribution, rather than a Gaussian as in Theorem 1.1. We make this choice in order to be generous to the algorithms we compare against. The algorithms we compare against clip the data or gradients before adding noise, so we make the problem easier for them by ensuring that the data is in fact bounded – i.e., we ensure that the clipping does not distort the data. Our algorithm does not require this kind of assumption on the features: Figure 2 shows the errors if the features are sampled from  $\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ .

We run Algorithm 1 with  $\ell = 1$  and  $\mathcal{R} = [-1,1]$ . For comparison, we run the following state-of-the-art regression algorithms:

- DP-GD based regressor: This algorithm applies noisy gradient descent to minimize the loss  $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left(\left\langle\hat{\theta},x_i\right\rangle-y_i\right)^2$ . The learning rate is 0.1, the number of epochs is 100, and the clipping rate is  $8d$ . (Our implementation of private GD gives result similar to the results obtained by running DP-SGD provided by TensorFlow Privacy.)  
- Gaussian covariate matrix perturbation regressor: This algorithm outputs  $\hat{\theta} = (X^T X + A)^{-1}(X^T y + b)$ , where  $A$  is an appropriately scaled Gaussian matrix of size  $d \times d$  and  $b$  is a Gaussian vector of size  $d$ .  
- Functional mechanism based regressor: This algorithm represents the loss function  $\sum_{i}^{n}\left(\left\langle \hat{\theta},x_{i}\right\rangle -y_{i}\right)^{2}$  as a polynomial in  $\hat{\theta}_1,\dots,\hat{\theta}_d$  add appropriately scaled Laplacian noise to each coefficient of the polynomial to obtain  $\hat{p}$  and uses the Broy

Theil-Sen estimator  $(\ell = 10)$

den-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm to find  $\hat{\theta}$  minimizing  $\hat{p}$ ; we use the implementation provided by Holohan et al. [HBMAL19].

Figure 1 shows that the error of our algorithm is lower than that of the other algorithms we compare against.

# 2.3 Non-private Algorithms

Before analyzing performance of private algorithms let us study performance on the non-private version of the private efficient Theil-Sen estimator: non-private can be obtained from Algorithm 1 by replacing Line 15 by a line that sets  $\hat{\theta}_i$  such that  $\max \left\{\left|\left\{\theta \in \Theta : \theta_i < \hat{\theta}_i\right\}\right|, \left|\left\{\theta \in \Theta : \theta_i > \hat{\theta}_i\right\}\right|\right\} = \frac{m}{2}$ .

Figure 3 shows that for reasonably large values of  $\ell$ , efficient multivariate Theil-Sen estimator performs as well as ordinary least squares estimator.

# 2.4 Values of  $\ell$

This section analyses relative performance of  $\ell$ -partition DP Theil-Sen for different values of  $\ell$ : we considered  $\ell \in \{1, 10, 20\}$ . Figure 4 shows that their convergence rates are comparable in contrast with the non private setting where increasing  $\ell$  improves the accuracy: this effect can be explained by the fact that the median heuristic uses amount of budget proportional to  $1 / \ell$  so increasing  $\ell$  improves the true median, but adds more noise.

Because of this observation we only consider  $\ell = 1$ .

# 2.5 Algorithms for Median

This section is analysing relative performance of efficient private Theil-Sen estimator for two choices of differentially private median heuristics: private median based on exponential mechanism that is used in Algorithm 1 and private median based on widened exponential mechanism defined in [AMSSV22]. Figure 5 shows that like in case of  $d = 1$  [AMSSV22], private median based on exponential mechanism performs better on synthetic data.
