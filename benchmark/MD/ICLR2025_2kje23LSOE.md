# ABSTRACT

This paper concerns the application of techniques from optimal transport (OT) to mean field control, in which the probability measures of interest in OT correspond to empirical distributions associated with a large collection of controlled agents. The control objective of interest motivates a one-sided relaxation of OT, in which the first marginal is fixed and the second marginal is constrained to a "moment class": a set of probability measures defined by generalized moment constraints. This relaxation is particularly interesting for control problems as it enables the coordination of agents without the need to know the desired distribution beforehand. The inclusion of an entropic regularizer is motivated by both computational considerations, and also to impose hard constraints on agent behavior. A computational approach inspired by the Sinkhorn algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. This new approach to distributed control is illustrated with an application of charging a fleet of electric vehicles while satisfying grid constraints. An online version is proposed and applied in a case study on the ElaadNL dataset containing 10,000 EV charging transactions in the Netherlands. This empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach to optimizing flexibility while respecting grid constraints.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Optimal Transport Optimal Transport (OT) theory first emerged in the 18th century, and more recently has become a significant tool in the machine learning toolbox (Villani, 2008; Peyré et al., 2019). The goal is simply described: given two random variables  $X$  and  $Y$ , find a joint probability measure  $\pi^{*}$  for the pair  $(X, Y)$  that preserves the marginals, and minimizes some criterion. When  $X$  and  $Y$  belong to a common state  $\mathcal{X}$ , the Monge-Kantorovich formulation is expressed as follows.

Let  $\mathcal{U}(\mu_1,\mu_2) = \{\pi \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X})\colon \pi_1 = \mu_1$ $\pi_{2} = \mu_{2}\}$  where  $\pi_{i}$  denotes the  $i$ th marginal, for example  $\pi_1(dx) = \int_{\mathcal{X}}\pi (dx,dy)$ , and with  $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X})$ , the set of Borel probability measures on  $\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X}$ . Given a cost function  $c\colon \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}_+$ , the optimal transport problem is formulated as the minimum

$$
\min  _ {\pi} \left\{\int_ {\mathcal {X} \times \mathcal {X}} c (x, y) \pi (d x, d y): \pi \in \mathcal {U} \left(\mu_ {1}, \mu_ {2}\right) \right\}. \tag {1}
$$

Several authors have proposed relaxations of the OT problem, such as unbalanced OT where an entropic penalization of the deviation from the marginals is introduced (Chizat et al., 2017). Relaxations of marginals have been considered to improve numerical performance or to approximate the OT problem (Balaji et al., 2020; Le et al., 2021; Alfonsi et al., 2020) but, to the best of our knowledge, never as a natural representation of a Mean Field control (MFC) problem.

Mean field control Many academic communities are interested in transforming probability measures efficiently. Examples include the fully probabilistic control design of Kárný (1996) and the related linearly-solvable Markov decision framework (Todorov, 2007). The area of mean field games begins with a multi-objective control problem, but the final solution technique amounts to transporting a probability measure on a high dimensional space in such a way as to minimize some objective function. Similar to mean field games is the cooperative setting of mean field control or ensemble control, with applications (Hochberg et al., 2006; Chertkov & Chernyak, 2018) ranging from power

systems to medicine; This technique can also be relaxed (Cammardella et al., 2020; Bušić & Meyn, 2018). More examples may be found in the survey of Garrabe & Russo (2022).

We are interested in the following control problem. Consider a set of  $K$  agents, whose state is denoted  $X_{k} = (S_{k},W_{k})\in \mathcal{X}$  for each  $1\leq k\leq K$ . It is assumed that  $S_{k}$  is an exogenous variable, while  $W_{k}$  is fully controllable. Given a cost function  $c\colon \mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}$  and a constraint function  $f\colon \mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}^{M}$ , we seek to minimize:

$$
\min  _ {W _ {k}} \left\{\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} c \left(X _ {k}\right): \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} f \left(X _ {k}\right) \leq 0 \right\} \tag {2}
$$

This general formulation allows for control of dynamical systems, in which case the state space  $\mathcal{X}$  is the set of possible sample paths. The optimization problem is designed for distributed control applications in which the global constraint is interpreted as coordinating the ensemble of agents, and the cost  $c$  represents a penalty for deviation from nominal behavior, as is the case in Chertkov & Chernyak (2018); Cammardella et al. (2020); Bušić & Meyn (2018).

The mean field limit of this problem corresponds intuitively to  $K\to \infty$  ..

$$
\min  _ {\mu} \left\{\int_ {\mathcal {X}} c (x) d \mu (x): \int_ {\mathcal {X}} f (x) d \mu (x) \leq 0 \text {a n d} \mu_ {1} = \nu \right\} \tag {3}
$$

in which  $\mu$  is the distribution of  $X = (S, W)$ , and  $\nu$  is the first marginal of  $\mu$ —the distribution of the exogenous variable  $S$ . It is important to note that the optimization is only done on the control variable (e.g. plugging time of an EV) and the distribution  $\nu$  (e.g. distribution of the arriving time and battery level of an EV) is not modified; this is what we will subsequently call "preserving the distribution of the exogenous variables".

Often in the Mean Field literature, a Kullback-Leibler cost term is introduced as a regularizer (Chertkov & Chernyak, 2018; Todorov, 2007) and similar control objectives, but with the constraints on the functions  $f$  relaxed through a quadratic penalty have been addressed (Cammardella et al., 2020; Bušić & Meyn, 2018). Inspired by the similarities between the OT problem (1) and the Mean Field Control applications such as (3), we want to build bridges between these fields and investigate how computational techniques from OT theory might apply to the computation of optimal control solutions.

Contributions We introduce Moment Constrained Optimal Transport for Control (MCOT-C) which is a natural representation of a MFC problem designed to achieve three objectives:

- Coordination of an ensemble of agents to achieve a desired goal.  
- Enforcement of physical constraints, both spatial and dynamics.  
- Enforcement of strict constraints on the distribution of exogenous variables.

Instead of considering the whole state space often very large or even infinite dimensional (e.g. trajectories of agents), this approach focuses on a finite set of moments, relevant to the control objective (e.g. signal tracking). This leads to a tractable algorithm: we modify the Sinkhorn algorithm (Cuturi, 2013) by replacing the update on the second marginal by gradient descent on the dual. An MFC application on charging a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) while satisfying grid constraints is used to illustrate this new approach. This MCOT-C setting is then extended in two ways: (i) by an online approach which allows to consider real datasets where the algorithm discovers at each step the state of the agents, as presented in section 4 with the ElaadNL dataset (OpenDataset, 2019) (ii) by the use of Monte Carlo type methods, which allow tackling MFC problems where the state space is infinite-dimensional, as in the case study on water heaters presented in appendix E.

Notations The state space  $\mathcal{X}$  is assumed to be a closed subset of  $\mathbb{R}^N$  with  $N\geq 1$ . It is always assumed that  $c(x,x) = 0$  for each  $x$ . For  $\pi$  a bivariate distribution on  $\mathcal{X}$ , its marginals will be denoted  $\pi_1$  and  $\pi_{2}$  such that  $\forall x\in \mathcal{X},\pi_1(dx) = \int_{\mathcal{X}}\pi (dx,dy)$  and  $\forall y\in \mathcal{X},\pi_2(dy) = \int_{\mathcal{X}}\pi (dx,dy)$ .

Solutions to each problem problem considered will involve a family of probability kernels  $\{T^{\lambda}:\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_+^M\}$ . For each  $\lambda$  we define  $\pi^{\lambda}$  by  $\pi^{\lambda}(dx,dy) = \mu_1(dx)T^{\lambda}(dx,dy)$ , and let  $\mu^{\lambda} = \pi_2^{\lambda}$  denote the second marginal:

$$
\mu^ {\lambda} (A) := \int \mu_ {1} (d x) T ^ {\lambda} (x, A), \qquad A \in \mathcal {B} (\mathcal {X})
$$

For measurable  $g\colon \mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}$  and  $f\colon \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}$ , we adopt the operator-theoretic notation,

$$
T ^ {\lambda} g (x) := \int T ^ {\lambda} (x, d y) g (y), \forall x \in \mathcal {X}, \quad \langle \pi , f \rangle := \int_ {\mathcal {X} \times \mathcal {X}} f (x, y) \pi (d x, d y)
$$

# 2 MOMENT CONSTRAINED OPTIMAL TRANSPORT FOR CONTROL

# 2.1 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

The  $m$  components  $\{f^m:1\leq m\leq M\}$  of the function  $f\colon \mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}^{M}$  define the moment class,

$$
\mathcal {P} _ {f} = \left\{\mu \in \mathcal {B} (\mathcal {X}): \langle \mu , f ^ {m} \rangle \leq 0: 1 \leq m \leq M \right\} \tag {4}
$$

The equality constraint  $\langle \mu, f^m \rangle = 0$  can be expressed as a pair of inequality constraints, so it is possible to impose equality constraints when needed. Recall that for MFC, any probability measure  $\pi$  on  $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X})$  is subject to the constraint that its first marginal  $\mu_1$  is given, and the distribution  $\nu$  of the exogenous variable is also fixed. Equivalently, the bivariate distribution  $\pi$  belongs to

$$
K (\mu_ {1}, \mu) = \{\pi \in \mathcal {U} (\mu_ {1}, \mu): \pi ((x _ {s}, x _ {w}), (y _ {s}, y _ {w})) = \mu_ {1} (d x _ {s}, d x _ {w}) T ((x _ {s}, x _ {w}), d y _ {w}) \delta_ {x _ {s}} (d y _ {s}) \}
$$

where  $\delta$  the Kronecker symbol, and  $T$  ranges over all probability kernels. That is, if  $\pi \in K(\mu_1,\mu)$  then  $\int_{\mathcal{W}}\pi_2(y_s,dy_w) = \int_{\mathcal{W}}\pi_1(y_s,dx_w) = \nu (y_s)$ , which corresponds to our objective of preserving  $\nu$  on  $S$ . Lastly, we will use the following Kullback Leibler (KL) regularizer:

$$
D _ {\mathrm {K L}} (\pi \| \mu_ {1} \otimes \mu_ {2}) = \int_ {\mathcal {X} \times \mathcal {X}} \log \left(\frac {\pi (x , y)}{\mu_ {1} (x) \mu_ {2} (y)}\right) \pi (d x, d y) \tag {5}
$$

The probability measure  $\mu_{2}$  in 5 may be chosen based on intuition regarding the form of  $\pi_2^*$ , chosen for ease of computation, or designed to encode hard constraints.

This allows us to introduce the Mean Field Control problem:

Problem MCOT-C: Moment Constrained Optimal Transport for Control

$$
\min  _ {\pi , \mu} \left\{\langle \pi , c \rangle + \varepsilon D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(\pi \| \mu_ {1} \otimes \mu_ {2}\right): \pi \in K \left(\mu_ {1}, \mu\right), \mu \in \mathcal {P} _ {f} \right\} \tag {6}
$$

# 2.2 DUAL PROBLEM

This subsection defines the dual and the theoretical properties needed for the algorithm but more details on duality theory and proofs may be found in the appendices A and B. The theoretical results of this problem in the Gaussian case are presented in appendix C. An example that illustrates the impact of regularization can be found in appendix D.

Assumptions Assumptions are required for the existence of optimizers and desirable properties of the dual:

(A1)  $c\colon \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}_+$  and  $f\colon \mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}^{M}$  are continuous, and there is an open neighborhood  $N\subset \mathbf{R}^M$  containing 0 such that  $\mathcal{P}_{f - r}$  is non-empty for all  $r\in N$  
(A2)  $\mu_{1}$  and  $\mu_{2}$  have compact support, and the problem is feasible under perturbations: for any  $r\in N$ , there is  $\pi$  and  $\mu$  satisfying  $\mu \in \mathcal{P}_{f - r}$  and  $\pi \in \mathcal{U}(\mu_1,\mu)$ .  
(A3)  $\Sigma^0 \coloneqq \operatorname{Cov}(Y)$  is positive definite when  $Y \sim \mu_2$ .

Dual The dual of MCOT-C is by definition the function  $\varphi^{*}\colon \mathbb{R}_{+}^{M}\to \mathbb{R}\cup \{-\infty \}$

$$
\varphi^ {*} (\lambda) = \varepsilon \min  _ {\pi , \mu} \left\{- \langle \pi , l \rangle + D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(\pi \| \mu_ {1} \otimes \mu_ {2}\right): \pi \in K \left(\mu_ {1}, \mu\right) \right\} \tag {7}
$$

For each  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_+^M$ ,  $\varepsilon > 0$  and  $x = (x_s, x_w) \in \mathcal{X}$ , we denote

$$
B _ {\lambda , \varepsilon} (x) = \varepsilon \log \int_ {y _ {w} \in \mathcal {W}} \exp \left(\varepsilon^ {- 1} \left(\lambda^ {\top} f \left(\left(x _ {s}, y _ {w}\right)\right) - c \left(\left(x _ {s}, x _ {w}\right), \left(x _ {s}, y _ {w}\right)\right)\right) \mu_ {2} \left(d y _ {w}\right) \right. \tag {8}
$$

Proposition 1. Subject to (A1)-(A3),

(i) The infimum (7) gives  $\varphi^{*}(\lambda) = -\langle \mu_{1},B_{\lambda ,\varepsilon}\rangle$  
(ii) The maximizer is  $\pi^{\lambda}(dx,dy) = T^{\lambda}(x,dy)\mu_{1}(dx)$  with

$$
T ^ {\lambda} (x, d y) = \mu_ {2} (d y) \exp \left(L ^ {\lambda} (x, y)\right), \quad L ^ {\lambda} (x, y) = \varepsilon^ {- 1} \left\{\lambda^ {T} f (y) - c (x, y) - B _ {\lambda , \varepsilon} (x) \right\}, \tag {9a}
$$

and  $\mu^{\lambda}(y) = \pi_2^{\lambda}(y)\quad \forall y\in \mathcal{X}$

(iii) There is no duality gap: there is a unique  $\lambda^{*}\in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{M}$  satisfying

$$
\varphi^ {*} (\lambda^ {*}) = \min  _ {\pi , \mu} \left\{\langle \pi , c \rangle + \varepsilon D _ {K L} \left(\pi \| \mu_ {1} \otimes \mu_ {2}\right): \pi \in K \left(\mu_ {1}, \mu\right), \mu \in \mathcal {P} _ {f} \right\} \tag {9b}
$$

It is convenient to make the change of variables  $\zeta = \varepsilon^{-1}\lambda$ , and consider

$$
\mathcal {J} (\zeta) := - \varepsilon^ {- 1} \varphi^ {*} (\varepsilon \zeta)
$$

We turn next to the representation of the derivatives of the dual function. The quantity  $\varepsilon^{-1}B_{\varepsilon \zeta ,\varepsilon}(x)$  is a log moment generating function for each  $x$ ; for this reason, it is not difficult to obtain suggestive expressions for the first and second derivatives with respect to  $\zeta$ .

Proposition 2. The function  $\mathcal{J}$  is convex and continuously differentiable. The first and second derivatives of  $\mathcal{J}$  admit the following representations:

$$
\nabla \mathcal {J} (\zeta) = m ^ {\lambda}, \quad \nabla^ {2} \mathcal {J} (\zeta) = \Sigma^ {\lambda} \tag {10a}
$$

in which  $m_i^\lambda = \langle \mu^\lambda, f_i \rangle = \mathsf{E}^\lambda[f_i(Y)]$  for each  $i$ , and the Hessian (10a) coincides with the conditional covariance:

$$
\Sigma^ {\lambda} = \mathsf {E} ^ {\lambda} [ f (Y) f (Y) ^ {T} ] - \mathsf {E} ^ {\lambda} \left[ \mathsf {E} ^ {\lambda} [ f (Y) \mid X ] \mathsf {E} ^ {\lambda} [ f (Y) \mid X ] ^ {T} \right] \tag {10b}
$$

It follows that  $\mathcal{J}$  is strictly convex:

Lemma 1. Suppose that (A1)-(A3) hold. Then, the covariance  $\Sigma^{\lambda}$  is full rank for any  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{M}$ .

# 2.3 ALGORITHM: SEMI-SINKHORN WITH GRADIENT DESCENT

For numerical experiments, the state space  $\mathcal{X}$  will be discretized and we will denote by  $N$  its cardinality. The cost will be represented by a matrix  $C\in \mathbb{R}_+^{N\times N}$ . The solution to MCOT-C obtained in Proposition 1 may be expressed

$$
\pi_ {i, j} ^ {*} = u _ {i} K _ {i, j} \exp \left(\zeta^ {* \intercal} f _ {j}\right) \tag {11}
$$

where  $K$  is the Gibbs kernel defined by  $K_{i,j} = \exp (-C_{i,j} / \varepsilon)\mu_{2,j}$  and  $u_{i} = \mu_{1,i} / \sum_{j}C_{i,j}e^{\zeta^{*}\tau f}$ . As shown in Proposition 2, it is possible to obtain a gradient descent algorithm, which looks similar to the Sinkhorn Algorithm (Cuturi, 2013), the difference being the update of  $\zeta^k$ .

Algorithm 1 Semi-Sinkhorn with Gradient Descent

Input:  $\mu_1, C, f$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \zeta^ {0} \leftarrow \mathbf {0} _ {\mathbf {M}} \\ k \leftarrow 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

while  $k < K$  max do

$$
\begin{array}{l} u _ {i} ^ {k + 1} \overleftarrow {\left. \begin{array}{l} \end{array} \right.} \mu_ {1, i} / \sum_ {j} C _ {i, j} e ^ {\zeta_ {k} \tau f} \\ \zeta^ {k + 1} \leftarrow \zeta^ {k} + \sum_ {i, j} f _ {j} u _ {i} ^ {k} C _ {i, j} e ^ {\zeta^ {k} \tau^ {f}} \\ \zeta^ {k + 1} \leftarrow \max  \{0, \zeta^ {k + 1} \} \\ k \leftarrow k + 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

end while

It is also possible to perform Newton's method rather than gradient descent by changing the update of  $\zeta_{k}$  by

$$
\Sigma^ {k} \leftarrow \sum_ {i, j} f _ {j} f _ {j} ^ {\intercal} u _ {i} ^ {k} C _ {i, j} e ^ {\zeta_ {k} ^ {\intercal} f}
$$

$$
\zeta^ {k + 1} \leftarrow \zeta^ {k} + \left(\Sigma^ {k}\right) ^ {- 1} \sum_ {i, j} f _ {j} u _ {i} ^ {k} C _ {i, j} e ^ {\zeta_ {k} \mathbf {\tau} ^ {f}}
$$

In cases where the starting point  $\zeta^0$  is close to the optimum  $\zeta^{*}$ , we can obtain quadratic convergence (C.T.Kelley, 1999).

# 3 USE CASE: EV CHARGING

# 3.1 PRESENTATION OF THE USE CASE

Consider a large fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) arriving to a charging station at random times and with random state of charge, according to an initial law  $\nu_{0}$ . There is a central planner whose goal is to maintain constraints for the aggregate power consumption, as well as constraints for each vehicle owner. The vehicles arrive during the period [9am, 10 : 30am], and must be fully charged by 5pm.

The goal is power tracking: total power consumption should follow a reference signal  $(r_t)$  over a time period  $[t_1, t_2]$ , with  $9\mathrm{am} \leq t_1 < t_2 \leq 5\mathrm{pm}$ . This can be formulated as an MCOT-C problem over the space of distributions on  $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{W}$  with  $\mathcal{S} = [0, T] \times [0, 1]$  and  $\mathcal{W} = [0, T]$ .

The two first coordinates of  $x \in \mathcal{X}$  are the time and the battery state of charge at the arrival and the third is the time when the EV will start charging, called the plugging time; so  $x \in \mathcal{X}$  is of the form  $x = (t_{a}, b, t_{c})$ . At each iteration, a gradient is calculated on  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{W}$ , with complexity of  $N_{t}^{3} \times N_{b}$  with  $N_{t} = 25$  and  $N_{b} = 20$ , being the number of discretization points in time and battery state of charge. In this example, this value remains relatively low so that Monte Carlo methods (presented in the appendix E) are not required. We use the MCOT-C problem presented in Section 2 with  $\varepsilon = 0.03$  being a compromise between computational stability and having a low value (as any non-negative value will enforce the physical constraints). We consider a version of problem MCOT-C with  $\mu_{1}$  modeling the naive decision rule in which a vehicle initiates charging on arrival:

$$
\mu_ {1} (t _ {a}, b, t _ {c}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \nu (t _ {a}, b) \text {i f} t _ {a} = t _ {c} \\ 0 \text {o t h e r w i s e} \end{array} \right.
$$

Initiation of charging must be after the arrival time (physical constraint) and every vehicle must be fully charged no later than  $5\mathrm{pm}$  (quality of service constraint). The following distribution meets these requirements,  $\mu_{2}(t_{a},b,t_{c}) = \mathbf{Unif}_{[t_{a},T - \frac{1 - b}{v} ]}(t_{c})$  , with  $v$  being the charging speed and Unif[a,b] being the density of uniform distribution over [a,b]. It is assumed that drivers wish to initiate charging as soon as possible: this makes it easier for the driver to manage an unforeseen event and may make it easier for the central planner to respond to a grid contingency. This preference is modeled through the cost  $c((.,.t_c^x),(.,.t_c^y)) = (t_c^x -t_c^y)^2$

# 3.2 NUMERICAL RESULTS

EV charging without unplugging The first results described here impose an additional constraint: once charging begins, it cannot be interrupted until the vehicle is fully charged. In the following simulations, a constraint on power consumption is imposed for the time period beginning at  $t_1 = 10\mathrm{am}$  and ending at  $t_2 = 12\mathrm{pm}$ . As the optimizer  $\mu^*$  will be mutually absolutely continuous with respect to  $\mu_2$ , both physical constraints and constraints on quality of service are imposed through choice of  $\mu_2$ .

Figure 2: (a) optimized consumption compared to the nominal with unplugging disabled; (b) optimized consumption with unplugging enabled; (c) optimal consumption with constraint infeasible without unplugging.

In Figure 1(a), the constraints enforced on  $\mu_{2}$  can be observed:

- Quality of Service constraint: At  $5\mathrm{pm}$ , all EVs must be fully charged. Thus, if a vehicle needs  $\Delta t$  minutes to charge, then the probability of connecting between  $5\mathrm{pm} - \Delta t$  and  $5\mathrm{pm}$  is zero. This is observed by the completely white lower right triangle.  
- Physical constraint: Vehicles cannot load before arriving, so there is no mass probability before 10am for vehicles arriving at 10am.

These constraints are found in the  $\mu_{\lambda}$  showed in Figure 1(b) and 1(c), as  $\mu_{\lambda}$  is a reweighting of  $\mu_{2}$ . Aggregated consumption displayed in Fig. 2 (a) shows that the first vehicles to arrive will start charging, but most of those arriving just before 10:00 am will initiate charging only if they arrive with a high battery level so that they are fully charged before the start of the constraint window from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm.

EV charging with unplugging The model can be extended by authorizing a vehicle to interrupt and restart charging. In this case,  $\mathcal{X}$  is extended with two extra time dimensions corresponding to an unplugging time and a re-plugging time. A second term is included in  $c$  that is quadratic in the difference of these times, designed to discourage charging interruption.

We find that unplugging does not impact significantly the optimal solution. Fig. 2 (a) and (b) provide a comparison. Only a slight difference is visible before  $10\mathrm{am}$ : A number of vehicles start to charge before the constraint, stop at  $10\mathrm{pm}$  and restart afterwards. However, in some cases, this extra flexibility in charging is necessary to obtain a feasible solution. Fig. 2 (c) shows results obtained when power consumption is not permitted in the middle of the day. In any feasible solution, a portion of vehicles stop charging for a period before they are fully charged.

Gradient control to flatten the curve For real-life applications, controlling overall consumption over part of the day through equality of consumption to a predefined signal can lead to a peak when the constraint is released. This phenomenon, due to the penalization of distant charging times, is observed in the different plots of Fig. 2. Consumption can be smoothed by introducing the derivative constraints

$$
\forall t \in [ 0, T ], | \langle g _ {t}, \mu \rangle | \leq g _ {\max }
$$

where  $g_{t} = f_{t + 1} - f_{t}$ . In this example,  $g_{\mathrm{max}} = 0.2$ , thus the overall consumption must not increase by more than 0.2 per hour, which is what we observe in Fig. 3: consumption at  $12\mathrm{pm}$  increases more slowly. We can also see the impact of the constraint on the gradient by looking

![](images/12087ddd5333e61bb02da8453325109e05eba469a410195a53f71d629d0c8974.jpg)

Figure 3: Optimal consumption with and without gradient control of the overall consumption

at the difference between Figure 1(b) and 1(c). In both

cases, vehicles arriving with a high battery level are put to charge first. This comes from the quadratic penalty on the start of the charging time: We prefer to charge those which will quickly be completely charged and which will free up space for those which will take longer.

# 4 ONLINE MCOT-C FOR EV CHARGING

In this section, we provide an online version of MCOT-C and test it on a real dataset.

# 4.1 FORMULATION OF ONLINE MCOT-C

First, while some theoretical models assume perfect knowledge of the battery level at each time step (Séguret, 2023), this value is hard to obtain in practice even if estimates are available (Rezvanizaniani et al., 2014) and existing datasets do not take this data into account (Amara-Ouali et al., 2021). Our choice on this subject is to focus on the leaving time  $t_{l}$  and the charging need  $\Delta t_{n}$ , which is the charging time requested by the EV owner. These parameters are easier to access and are consistent with other articles studying real datasets (He et al., 2012; Sadeghianpourhamami et al., 2018). Arriving EVs are therefore defined on the following state space:

$$
\mathcal {S} = \underbrace {\left[ 0 , 2 4 \right]} _ {\text {A r r i v i n g t i m e}} \times \underbrace {\left[ 0 , 2 4 \right]} _ {\text {L e a v i n g t i m e}} \times \underbrace {\left[ 0 , 2 4 \right]} _ {\text {C h a r g i n g n e e d}} \times \underbrace {\left\{0 , N _ {p} \right\}} _ {\text {M a x p o w e r}} \tag {12a}
$$

At each time step  $t \in [0,24]$ , EVs are controlled through their charging starting time  $t_c$ . The control space is thus defined as:

$$
\mathcal {W} ^ {(t)} = \underbrace {[ t , 2 4 ]} _ {\text {P l u g g i n g t i m e} t _ {c}} \tag {12b}
$$

and we define the product space:  $\mathcal{X}^{(t)} = \mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{W}^{(t)}$ . At each time step  $t\in [0,24]$ , this sequence of actions will take place:

1. New EVs arrive at the charging station and are added to the list of vehicles already present and not charging yet  $\{S_i^{(t)}\} = \{S_i:t_a^i\leq t$  and  $t_c^i\geq t\}$ . The empirical  $\nu^{(t)}$  is updated:

$$
\nu^ {(t)} (s) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \frac {1}{N _ {t}} \sum_ {i} \delta \left(s - S _ {i} ^ {(t)}\right) & \text {i f} t _ {a} \leq t \\ \frac {N}{N _ {t}} \nu (s) & \text {i f} t _ {a} > t \end{array} \right. \tag {13a}
$$

where  $N_{t} = \int_{S}\sum_{i}\delta (s - S_{i}^{(t)})ds + N\int_{S}\nu (s)\mathbf{1}_{t_{a} > t}(s)ds$  is the number of vehicles already arrived and not charging plus the number of vehicles that are estimated to arrive.

2.  $\mu_1^{(t)}$  is defined by the "Plug when Arrive" strategy:  $\forall s = (t_a, t_l, \Delta t_n, p) \in S$ ,

$$
\mu_ {1} ^ {(t)} (s, t _ {c}) = \nu^ {(t)} (s) \delta \left(t _ {c} - t _ {a}\right) \tag {13b}
$$

3.  $\mu_2^{(t)}$  is defined as "Plug with a uniform distribution" strategy:

$$
\forall s = \left(t _ {a}, t _ {l}, \Delta t _ {n}, p\right) \in \mathcal {S}, t _ {c} \in \mathcal {W},
$$

$$
\mu_ {2} ^ {(t)} (s, t _ {c}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \mathbf {U n i f} _ {[ t _ {a}, t _ {l} - \Delta t _ {n} ]} (t _ {c}) \nu^ {(t)} (s) & \text {i f} t _ {a} > t \\ \mathbf {U n i f} _ {[ t, t _ {l} - \Delta t _ {n} ]} (t _ {c}) \nu^ {(t)} (s) & \text {i f} t _ {a} \leq t \end{array} \right. \tag {13c}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Unif}[a,b]$  is the density of the uniform distribution on the segment  $[a,b]$ . For the sake of simplicity, we assume that there is no outlier (no vehicle that would require more charging time than the difference between their arrival time and leaving time in particular). As in Section 3,  $\mu_{2}$  is designed to incorporate the strong constraint of respecting the quality of service through the absolute continuity of  $\mu$  with  $\mu_{2}$  (due to the KL term).

4. The central planner will minimize Equation (6) to obtain:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \pi^ {(t)} = \arg \min  \langle \pi , c \rangle + \varepsilon D _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(\pi \| \mu_ {1} ^ {(t)} \otimes \mu_ {2} ^ {(t)}\right) \\ \pi \in K (\mu_ {1} ^ {(t)}, \mu) \\ \mu \in \mathcal {P} _ {f ^ {(t)}} \\ \end{array}
$$

The function  $c$  chosen here is a quadratic penalization:  $c((s^x, t_c^x), (s^y, t_c^y)) = (t_c^x - t_c^y)^2$ . In this case, as we compare it with the "Plug When Arrive" strategy for which  $t_c^x = t_a^x$ ,  $c$  is a penalty for starting charging long after the vehicle arrives.

5. For each vehicle  $S_{i}^{(t)}$ , its plugging time  $t_{c}^{i}$  is randomly chosen according to  $\pi_2^{(t)}(S_i^{(t)},.)$ .  $f$  is then updated as:  $f^{(t + 1)} = f^{(t)} + \frac{1}{N}\sum_{t_c^i = t}f(S_i^{(t)})$ . Vehicles  $S_{i}^{(t)}$  such that  $t_c^i = t$  begin their charging.

# 4.2 ALGORITHM

In Algorithm 2,  $Alg(\zeta^{(t)},\mu_1,\mu_2)$  returns  $\zeta^{(t + 1)}$  the value of Algorithm 1 with the stopping criterion  $N_{t}\| (\langle f^{(t)},\mu_{\zeta^{(t)}}\rangle)^{+}\| \leq N\kappa$  and  $(.)^{+}$  is the positive part function:  $\forall x\in \mathbb{R}^M,(x)_m^+ = \max (0,x_m)$ . The norm  $\| \|$  can be chosen as desired but a good candidate is the infinite norm. In general,  $\kappa$  is chosen relatively small, and with this norm,  $N\kappa$  corresponds to the maximum error on all the vehicles that we can afford to have, we can estimate that this error evolves linearly with N, which explains the multiplication by  $N$  (it is important to remember that N is the order of magnitude of the vehicles that will arrive during the day). We define the convergence error at time  $t$  as  $\mathcal{E}_t(\zeta) = \frac{N_t}{N}\| (\langle f^{(t)},\mu_{\zeta^{(t)}}\rangle)^{+}\|$  and  $\nu_{r}$ , the real arrival law of EVs. With the definitions of  $\mu_2^{(t)}$  and  $\mu_1^{(t)}$  in Equations (13) and Proposition 1, we define  $F_{\zeta}$  as:  $\forall s\in S,F_{\zeta}(s) =$

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \frac {\int_ {\mathcal {W}} \mu_ {\zeta} ^ {(t)} (s , t _ {c}) f (s , t _ {c}) d t _ {c}}{\nu^ {(t)} (s)} & \text {i f} \nu^ {(t)} (s) \neq 0 \\ 0 & \text {o t h e r w i s e} \end{array} \right.
$$

Proposition 3. (i)  $\mathcal{E}_{t + 1}(\zeta_t)$  is bounded by  $\kappa$ , a stochastic term, and a term corresponding to a poor prediction of the law  $\nu$ :

$$
\mathcal {E} _ {t + 1} (\zeta_ {t}) \leq \kappa + \Big \| \Big (\sum_ {t _ {a} ^ {i} = t + 1} \frac {F _ {\zeta} (S _ {i} ^ {(t + 1)})}{N} - \mathbb {E} _ {\nu_ {r}} [ F _ {\zeta} \mathbf {1} _ {t _ {a} = t + 1} ] \Big) ^ {+} \Big \| + \Big \| \Big (\mathbb {E} _ {\nu_ {r}} [ F _ {\zeta} \mathbf {1} _ {t _ {a} = t + 1} ] - \mathbb {E} _ {\nu} [ F _ {\zeta} \mathbf {1} _ {t _ {a} = t + 1} ] \Big) ^ {+} \Big \|
$$

(i) The second term could be bounded with Bienaymé-Tchebychev inequality to obtain:

$$
\mathbb {P} \Big (\big \| \Big (\sum_ {t _ {a} ^ {i} = t + 1} \frac {F _ {\zeta} (S _ {i} ^ {(t + 1)})}{N} - \mathbb {E} _ {\nu_ {r}} [ F _ {\zeta} \mathbf {1} _ {t _ {a} = t + 1} ] \Big) ^ {+} \big \| \geq \kappa_ {0} \Big) \leq \frac {\mathbb {V} _ {\nu_ {r}} [ F _ {\zeta} \mathbf {1} _ {t _ {a} = t + 1} ]}{N \kappa_ {0} ^ {2}}
$$

Thus, starting from scratch at each time step is unnecessary, and the optimization made in the previous step offers a good  $\zeta$  to start with. This starting point is better if (i) the estimation of the arrival law of the vehicles  $\nu$  is close from the real arrival law of vehicles  $\nu_{r}$  and (ii) if  $N$ , the order of magnitude of EVs is large.

# 4.3 DATA OVERVIEW

The dataset used in this paper is composed of 10.000 random transactions from public charging stations operated by EVnetNL in the Netherlands (OpenDataset, 2019), in the year 2019. For each

![](images/74d4a99f3a18d578c3b64ec1811bec540090c107864db336d17fecd5e9479196.jpg)  
Figure 4: (a) Consumptions for the "Plug When Arrive"  $\mu$ 1 strategy with the arrival of EV predicted with  $\nu$  and with the real distribution of EV; (b) Optimized Consumption for a constraint of  $650\mathrm{kW}$  for the aggregated consumption; (c) Optimized consumption for the same maximum power constraint and a constraint of  $120\mathrm{kW/h}$  for the gradient of the aggregated consumption.

transaction, several pieces of information are provided including the arrival time  $t_a$ , the leaving time  $t_l$ , the plugging time  $\Delta t_n$ , and the max power  $P$ . A more detailed description could be found in Refa & Hubbers (2019) and this dataset have already been used for clustering algorithm (Straka & Buzna, 2019) but not yet for Mean Field Control Algorithm.

There is a difference between weekdays and weekend days, so in this paper, we will consider the 7253 transactions happening during weekdays and divide them randomly.  $90\%$  of these weekdays will form a training set of 231 days (6540 transactions) and will be considered historical data. A test day is created with the remaining  $10\%$  of weekdays (21 days : 713 transactions) by grouping the corresponding 713 vehicle arrivals. The predicted distribution  $\nu$  is computed on the training set considered historical data and  $N = \frac{6540}{9} \simeq 727$  is the number of vehicles expected to arrive on this test day. In (6), we set  $\varepsilon = 0.1$  because we want a relatively low value to limit the impact of entropic relaxation (term in Kullback Leibler), but not too low, as this risks posing computational problems (because of the  $\varepsilon^{-1}$  in the exponential in Proposition 1.

To compute efficiently the gradient  $G(\zeta_k)$  at each iteration of Algorithm 2, we need to discretize the state space  $\mathcal{X}$ : The day is divided into  $T + 1 = 97$  steps (indexed from 0 to  $T$ ) with a stepsize  $\Delta t$  of 15 minutes, which allows rapid grid constraint changes to be taken into account. For the power discretization, we group each EV between  $4\mathrm{kW}$ ,  $7.5\mathrm{kW}$ , and  $12\mathrm{kW}$ . This choice of discretization is standard (used for example in Sadeghianpourhamami et al. (2018)). We assume here that vehicles connected the day before are not affected by our strategy, because they are already connected, but their consumption is taken into account in order to come closer to reality, particularly in the case of controlling the gradient of aggregate consumption. We therefore consider the aggregate consumption of vehicles arriving throughout the day and that of vehicles arriving the day before (this impact is mainly present before 8 a.m.).

# 4.4 CONTROL OF THE AGGREGATED CONSUMPTION

On Fig. 4, the nominal consumption in blue corresponds to what is expected by the charging station, these are the historical data with the plugging strategy  $\mu_{1}$  "Plug when Arrive". On (a), we can see the difference with the consumption for the real arrival of EV during the day with the same plugging strategy. The first peak in the morning lasts longer, while the second peak seems to be weaker. On (b), a constraint imposed by the charging station over the power consumed of  $r_f = 650\mathrm{kW}$  is added through the moment constraints: define for each  $m$  the function  $f_{m}$  via  $f_{m}(s,t_{c}) = p_{\max}$  if  $m\in [t_c,t_c + \Delta t_n]$ ,  $f_{m}(s,t_{c}) = 0$  otherwise, and impose for each  $m$  the constraint  $\langle f_m,\mu \rangle -r_f\leq 0$

This value of  $650\mathrm{kW}$  is chosen arbitrarily here, and any other can be chosen as long as it remains realistic. This optimization makes it possible to exploit flexibility while respecting the imposed constraint, despite the prediction error on the length of the first peak. Peaks above the maximum constraint correspond to unforeseen arrivals of a large number of vehicles that must connect directly. It can also be due to the convergence not completely achieved by the algorithm, which depends on the value of  $\kappa$  here chosen at  $10\mathrm{kW}$ .

# 4.5 CONTROL OF THE GRADIENT OF THE AGGREGATED CONSUMPTION

Another constraint that we want to respect in order to preserve the grid stability is the speed with which consumption will increase or decrease. On Fig. 4 (a) (b), we see a strong peak at the start of the day. We will seek to smooth this peak by imposing a constraint on the gradient of the power consumed. On (c), this constraint imposed by the charging station of  $r_g = 100\mathrm{kW / h}$  is added through the moment constraints:  $\forall m\in [0,T - 1],\forall (s,t_c)\in \mathcal{X}^{(t)},g_m(s,t_c) = f_{m + 1}(s,t_c) - f_m(s,t_c)$  and we impose:  $\forall m\in [0,T - 1], - r_g\leq N\langle g_m,\mu \rangle \leq r_g$ .

![](images/7df215066864d0c2942184ded8f08f34413062f10d57526a971bd04390689c20.jpg)  
Figure 5: When the prediction  $\nu$  differs greatly from the reality

This addition of constraints makes it possible to smooth out the slope which begins around 6am. There are always irregularities due to deviation from prediction and the slight excess of the constraint on the first peak can be explained by the maximum exploitation of the flexibility of the vehicles to respect the gradient constraint, which does not leave enough flexibility when vehicles arrive between 9am and 3pm and have to be connected directly.

# 4.6 SENSITIVITY

# TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

# ACTUAL EV ARRIVAL AND ITS PREDICTION

This model depends on the quality of the prediction  $\nu$  made for the rest of the day. In this part, we try to test the robustness against this

quality of prediction, by twisting the previous prediction: the central planner expects  $30\%$  less vehicles before 12am and  $30\%$  more vehicles after. The aggregated power consumption associated to this prediction is shown in blue in Fig. 5. We can thus observe that compliance with the same maximal power constraint of  $650kW$  is still obtained and the consumption is very close to Fig. 4 (b). We therefore have a certain robustness of the model concerning the prediction  $\nu$ . This robustness is surely obtained here by the fact that we can change the connection time of a previously arrived vehicle as long as it is not connected. The algorithm can therefore, in the event of an unexpected arrival of vehicles to be connected immediately, postpone the connection time of less priority vehicles. But this poorer prediction comes at a cost: when comparing  $\langle \pi, c \rangle$  between the case where the prediction is close (shown in figure 4 (a)) and this case, we find that the average time between arrival time  $t_a$  and connection time  $t_c$  increases from 11 minutes to 12 minutes. Having a less accurate prediction will therefore make less optimal use of flexibility.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

One-sided moment relaxation of OT problem provides a very natural representation setting for tracking applications in control. In such applications, the OT problem is often infinite-dimensional (e.g. trajectories of agents). Instead of using approximations techniques for OT, MCOT-C leads to a tractable algorithm by directly considering only the distribution moments that are relevant for control. Furthermore, KL-term has a dual role in MCOT-C: a relaxation term as in many other machine learning algorithms, but it also enables to enforce the constraints on the dynamics via the choice of  $\mu_{2}$  and absolute continuity imposed by KL. There are many directions for future research:

- The "Semi Sinkhorn" algorithm might be improved through the introduction of advanced optimization techniques (e.g., proximal methods or momentum).  
- Obtain probabilistic error bounds for the stochastic gradient descent algorithms proposed in appendix E, which is useful in cases where the size of the problem makes the use of Monte Carlo methods attractive such as the water heaters problem presented in appendix E.2.  
- We believe that representing distributions by their moments to perform optimal transport has broader applications in machine learning and control. We aim to explore its potential in other contexts.

In this appendix, dualization and proofs are presented in Section A and B. A theoretical extension is presented in appendix C, in the case where the distributions are Gaussian and the moments specified are the means and variances. In appendix D, an experiment involving the transport of a uniform law illustrates the convergence of the regularized problem to the non-regularized problem, when the regularization parameter  $\varepsilon$  tends to 0. Another example of Mean Field Control using a Monte Carlo implementation is proposed in appendix E to illustrate the approach in the case of a large state space.
