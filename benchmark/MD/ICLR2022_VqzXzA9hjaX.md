# ABSTRACT

Selecting an appropriate optimizer for a given problem is of major interest for researchers and practitioners. Many analytical optimizers have been proposed using a variety of theoretical and empirical approaches; however, none can offer a universal advantage over other competitive optimizers. We are thus motivated to study a new problem named Optimizer Amalgamation: how can we best combine a pool of "teacher" optimizers into a single "student" optimizer that can have stronger problem-specific performance? In this paper, we draw inspiration from the field of "learning to optimize" to use a learnable amalgamation target. First, we define three differentiable amalgamation mechanisms to amalgamate a pool of analytical optimizers by gradient descent. Then, in order to reduce variance of the amalgamation process, we also explore methods to stabilize the amalgamation process by perturbing the amalgamation target. Finally, we present experiments showing the superiority of our amalgamated optimizer compared to its amalgamated components and learning to optimize baselines, and the efficacy of our variance reducing perturbations.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Gradient-based optimization is ubiquitous in machine learning; accordingly, a cottage industry of gradient-based optimizer design has emerged (Schmidt et al., 2020). These optimizers generally propose algorithms that aim to make the "best" parameter update for a computed gradient (Kingma & Ba, 2017; Liu et al., 2020), with some also modifying the location where the parameters are computed (Zhang et al., 2019b). However, each gradient-based optimizer claim specific problems where they hold performance advantages, none can claim to be universally superior. Due to the "No Free Lunch" theorem for optimization (Wolpert & Macready, 1997), no optimizer can provide better performance on a class of problems without somehow integrating problem-specific knowledge from that class.

Furthermore, problems such as training neural networks are not homogeneous. In the spatial dimension, different layers or even parameters can have different behavior (Chen et al., 2020b). Also, as evidenced by the popularity of learning rate schedules, neural network optimization also behaves very differently in the temporal dimension as well (Golatkar et al., 2019). This implies that no optimizer can provide the best performance for all parameters on a single problem or best performance over the entire optimization process.

In order to build a stronger optimizer, we propose the new problem of optimizer amalgamation: how can we best combine a pool of multiple "teacher" optimizers, each of which might be good in certain cases, into a single stronger "student" optimizer that integrates their strengths and offsets their weaknesses? Specifically, we wish for our combined optimizer to be adaptive both per-parameter and per-iteration, and exploit problem-specific knowledge to improve performance on a class of problems.

To "amalgamate" an optimizer from a pool of optimizers, we draw inspiration from recent work in Learning to Optimize which provides a natural way to parameterize and train optimization update rules. In Learning to Optimize, optimizers are treated as policies to be learned from data. These "learned" optimizers are typically parameterized by a recurrent neural network (Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Lv et al., 2017); then, the optimizer is meta-trained to minimize the loss of training problems, or "optimizees", by gradient descent using truncated back-propagation through time. Yet to our best knowledge, no existing work has leveraged those learnable parameterizations to amalgamate and combine analytical optimizers.

For our proposed formulation of optimizer amalgamation, we treat the learned optimizer as the amalgamation target. Then, we define amalgamation losses which can be used to combine feedback from multiple analytical optimizers into a single amalgamated optimizer, and present several amalgamation schemes. Finally, we explore smoothing methods that can be used during the amalgamation process to reduce the variance of the amalgamated optimizers. Our contributions are outlined below:

- We formulate the new problem of optimizer amalgamation, which we define as finding a way to best amalgamate a pool of multiple analytical optimizers to produce a single stronger optimizer. We present three schemes of optimizer amalgamation: additive amalgamation, min-max amalgamation, and imitation of a trained choice.  
- We observe instability during the amalgamation process which leads to amalgamated optimizers having varied performance across multiple replicates. To mitigate this problem, we explore ways to reduce amalgamation variance by improving smoothness of the parameter space. We propose smoothing both by random noise or adversarial noise.  
- We present experiments showing extensive and consistent results that validate the effectiveness of our proposal. Specifically, we find that more advanced amalgamation techniques and weight space training noise lead better average case performance and reduced variance. We also show that our amalgamation method performs significantly better than previous methods on all problems, with few exceptions.

# 2 RELATED WORKS

Knowledge Distillation and Amalgamation The prototype of knowledge distillation was first introduced by (Buciluundefined et al., 2006), which used it for model compression in order to train neural networks ("students") to imitate the output of more complex models ("teachers"). Knowledge distillation was later formalized by (Hinton et al., 2015), who added a temperature parameter to soften the teacher predictions and found significant performance gains as a result.

The success of knowledge distillation spurred significant efforts to explain its effectiveness. Notably, Chen et al. (2020c); Yuan et al. (2020) discovered that trained distillation teachers could be replaced by hand-crafted distributions. (Yuan et al., 2020) provided further theoretical and empirical explanation for this behavior by explicitly connecting Knowledge distillation to label smoothing, and (Ma et al.; Chen et al., 2021b) further credited the benefits of knowledge distillation to the improved smoothness of loss surfaces, which has been demonstrated to help adversarial training Cohen et al. (2019); Lecuyer et al. (2019) and the training of sparse neural networks Ma et al..

The potential of knowledge distillation to improve the training of neural networks also spurred diverse works extending knowledge distillation. For example, (Romero et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2018; 2019b; Ye et al., 2020b) propose using intermediate feature representations as distillation targets instead of just network outputs, and (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a) unify student and teacher network training to reduce computational costs. Knowledge distillation has also been extended to distilling multiple teachers, which is termed Knowledge Amalgamation (Shen et al., 2019a; Luo et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2019; 2020a).

Although using output logits from pre-trained networks has been extensively explored in knowledge distillation, we study a new direction of research distilling optimization knowledge from sophisticated analytical optimizers to produce stronger "learned" optimizers, hence the name "optimizer amalgamation". Not only this is a new topic never studied by existing knowledge distillation literature, but also it needs to distill longitudinal output dynamics — not one final output — from multiple teachers.

Learning to optimize Learning to Optimize is a branch of meta learning which proposes to replace hand-crafted analytical optimizers with learned optimizers trained by solving optimization problems, or optimizees. The concept was first introduced by (Andrychowicz et al., 2016), who used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model in order to parameterize gradient-based optimizers. This model took the loss gradient as its input and output a learned update rule which was then trained by gradient descent using truncated backpropagation through time. (Andrychowicz et al., 2016) also established a coordinate-wise design pattern, where the same LSTM weights are applied to each parameter of the optimizee in order to facilitate generalization to models with different architectures.

Building on this architecture, Wichrowska et al. (2017) and Lv et al. (2017) proposed improvements such as hierarchical architectures connecting parameter RNNs together and augmenting the gradient with additional inputs. Many methods have also been proposed to improve the training of learned optimizers such as random scaling and convex augmentation (Lv et al., 2017), curriculum learning and imitation learning (Chen et al., 2020a), and Jacobian regularization (Li et al., 2020). Notably, Chen et al. (2020a) also proposed a method of imitation learning, which can be viewed as a way of distilling a single analytical optimizer into a learned parameterization.

Learning to Optimize has been extended to a variety of other problems such as graph convolutional networks (You et al., 2020), domain generalization (Chen et al., 2020b), noisy label training (Chen et al., 2020c), and adversarial training (Jiang et al., 2018; Xiong & Hsieh, 2020). Moving away from gradient-based optimization, black-box optimization has also been explored (Chen et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2021). For a comprehensive survey with benchmarks, readers may refer to Chen et al. (2021a).

Perturbations and Robustness The optimization process is naturally subject to many possible sources of noise, such as the stochastic gradient noise Devolder et al. (2011); Gorbunov et al. (2020); Simsekli et al. (2019) which is often highly non-Gaussian and heavy-tail in practice; the random initialization and (often non-optimal) hyperparameter configuration; the different local minimum reached each time in non-convex optimization Jain & Kar (2017); and the limited numerical precision in implementations De Sa et al. (2017). The seen and unseen optimizees also constitute domain shifts in our case. In order for a consistent and reliable amalgamation process, the training needs to incorporate resistance to certain perturbations of the optimization process.

We draw inspiration from deep learning defense against various random or malicious perturbations. For example, stability training Zheng et al. (2016) stabilizes deep networks against small input distortions by regularizing the feature divergence caused by adding random Gaussian noises to the inputs. Adversarial robustness measures the ability of a neural network to defend against malicious perturbations of its inputs (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014). For that purpose, random smoothening (Lecuyer et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2019) and adversarial training (Madry et al., 2017) have been found to increase model robustness with regard to random corruptions or worst-case perturbations; as well as against testing-time domain shifts Ganin et al. (2016). Recent work (He et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020) extends input perturbations to weight perturbations that explicitly regularize the flatness of the weight loss landscape, forming a double-perturbation mechanism for both inputs and weights.

# 3 OPTIMIZER AMALGAMATION

# 3.1 MOTIVATION

Optimizer selection and hyperparameter optimization is a difficult task even for experts. With a vast number of optimizers to choose from with varying performance dependent on the specific problem and data (Schmidt et al., 2020), most practitioners choose a reasonable default optimizer such as SGD or Adam and tune the learning rate to be "good enough" following some rule of thumb.

As a consequence of the No Free Lunch theorem (Wolpert & Macready, 1997), the best optimizer to use for each problem, weight tensor within each problem, or each parameter may be different. In practice, different layers within a given neural network can benefit from differently tuned hyperparameters, for example by meta-tuning learning rates by layer (Chen et al., 2020b).

Accordingly, we wish to train an optimizer which is sufficiently versatile and adaptive at different stages of training and even to each parameter individually. Many methods have been proposed to parameterize optimizers in learnable forms including coordinate-wise LSTMs Andrychowicz et al. (2016); Lv et al. (2017), recurrent neural networks with hierarchical architectures Wichrowska et al. (2017); Metz et al. (2019), and symbolically in terms of predefined blocks Bello et al. (2017). Due to its high expressiveness and relative ease of training, we will use the workhorse of LSTM-based RNNProp architecture described by Lv et al. (2017) as our amalgamation target.

# 3.2 THE BASIC DISTILLATION MECHANISM

Knowledge distillation can be viewed as regularizing the training loss with a distillation loss that measures the distance between teacher and student predictions (Hinton et al., 2015). In order to distill a pool of teacher optimizers  $\mathbf{T} = T_{1}, T_{2}, \ldots, T_{k}$  into our target policy  $P$  by truncated backpropagation (Appendix A: Algorithm 1), we start by defining a training loss and amalgamation loss.

Meta Loss In the context of training optimizers, the training loss is described by the meta loss, which is a function of the optimize problem loss at each step (Andrychowicz et al., 2016). Suppose we are training a policy  $P$  with parameters  $\phi$  on a problem  $\mathcal{M}:\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}$  whose output is a loss for each point in data domain  $\mathcal{X}$ . During each iteration during truncated backpropagation through time,  $P$  is used to compute parameter updates for  $\mathcal{M}$  to obtain a trajectory of optimize parameters  $\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\ldots \theta_{N}$  where for the ith data batch  $\pmb{x}_i$  and parameters  $\theta_{i}$  at step  $i$ , i.e.  $\theta_{i + 1} = \theta_{i} - P(\nabla_{\theta_{i}}\mathcal{M}(\pmb{x}_{i},\theta_{i}))$ .

For some weighting function  $f_{1}, f_{2}, \ldots, f_{N}$ , the meta loss is  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{meta}}(\pmb{x}, \theta_i; \phi) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_i(\mathcal{M}(\pmb{x}_i, \theta_i))$ ; specifically, we will use the scaled log meta loss  $f_i(m) = \log(m) - \log(\mathcal{M}(\pmb{x}_i, \theta_0))$ , which can be interpreted as the "mean log improvement."

Distillation Loss The distillation loss in knowledge distillation measures the distance between teacher predictions and student predictions. In training optimizers, this corresponds to the distance between the optimization trajectories generated by the teacher and student. For our distillation loss, we adopt a loss function similar to the imitation loss mechanism described by Chen et al. (2020a).

Suppose we have optimize parameter trajectories  $\pmb{\theta}_i = (\theta_i^{(P)},\theta_i^{(T)})$  generated by the teacher and student, respectively. Then, the distillation loss  $\mathcal{L}_T$  for teacher  $T$  is given by the  $l_{2}$  log-loss

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {T} (\boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {i}; \phi) = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \log \left\| \theta_ {i} ^ {(P)} - \theta_ {i} ^ {(T)} \right\| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {1}
$$

# 3.3 AMALGAMATION OF MULTIPLE TEACHER OPTIMIZERS: THREE SCHEMES

Now, what if there are multiple teachers that we wish to amalgamate into a single policy? How to best combine different knowledge sources is a non-trivial question. We propose three mechanisms:

(1) Mean Amalgamation: adding distillation loss terms for each of the optimizers with constant equal weights.  
(2) Min-max Amalgamation: using a min-max approach to combine loss terms for each of the optimizers, i.e., "the winner (worst) takes all".  
(3) Optimal Choice Amalgamation: First training an intermediate policy to choose the best optimizer to apply at each step, then distilling from that "choice optimizer".

Mean Amalgamation In order to amalgamate our pool of teachers  $T = T_{1}, \ldots, T_{|\mathbf{T}|}$ , we generate  $|T| + 1$  trajectories  $\pmb{\theta}_{i} = (\theta_{i}^{(P)}, \theta_{i}^{(T_{1})} \ldots \theta_{i}^{(T_{|\mathbf{T}|})})$  and add distillation losses for each teacher:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {m e a n}} (\boldsymbol {x}; \boldsymbol {\theta} _ {i}; \phi) = \mathcal {L} _ {\text {m e t a}} (\boldsymbol {x}; \theta_ {i} ^ {(P)}; \phi) + \alpha \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \frac {1}{| \boldsymbol {T} |} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {| \boldsymbol {T} |} \log \left\| \theta_ {i} ^ {(P)} - \theta_ {i} ^ {(T _ {i})} \right\| _ {2}. \tag {2}
$$

If we view knowledge distillation as a regularizer which provides soft targets during training, mean amalgamation is the logical extension of this by simply adding multiple regularizers to training.

An interesting observation is: when multiple teachers diverge, mean amalgamation loss tends to encourage the optimizer to choose one of the teachers to follow, potentially discarding the influence of all other teachers. This may occur if one teacher is moving faster than another in the optimizee space, or if the teachers diverge in the direction of two different minima. As this choice is a local minimum with respect to the mean log amalgamation loss, the optimizer may "stick" to that teacher, even if it is not the best choice.

Min-Max Amalgamation In order to address this stickiness, we propose a second method: min-max amalgamation. In min-max amalgamation, distillation losses are instead combined by taking the maximum distillation loss among all terms, at each time step:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\min  - \max } (\boldsymbol {x}; \theta_ {i}; \phi) = \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {m e t a}} (\boldsymbol {x}; \theta_ {i} ^ {(P)}; \phi) + \alpha \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \max  _ {T \in \boldsymbol {T}} \log \left\| \theta_ {i} ^ {(P)} - \theta_ {i} ^ {(T)} \right\| _ {2}. \tag {3}
$$

This results in a v-shaped loss landscape which encourages the amalgamation target to be between the trajectories generated by the teacher pool and prevents the optimizer from "sticking" to one of the teachers.

One weakness shared by both mean and min-max amalgamation is memory usage. Both require complete training trajectories for each teacher in the pool to be stored in memory and built into the compute graph, resulting in memory usage proportional with the number of teachers and limiting the number of teachers that we could amalgamate from in one pool.

Min-max amalgamation also does not fully solve the problem of diverging teachers. While min-max amalgamation does ensure that no teacher is ignored, it pushes the amalgamation target to the midpoint between the optimizee weights of the two teachers, which does not necessarily correspond to a good optimizee loss. In fact, when teachers diverge into multiple local minima, any solution which considers all teachers must necessarily push the learned optimizer against the gradient, while any solution which allows the learned optimizer to pick one side must discard a number of teachers.

Optimal Choice Amalgamation To fully unlock the power of knowledge amalgamation, we propose to solve the teacher divergence problem by first training an intermediate amalgamation target. By using only one teacher for a final distillation step, we remove the possibility of multiple teachers diverging while also allowing us to use more teachers without a memory penalty.

For optimizer pool  $T$ , we define an choice optimizer  $C$  which produces choices  $c_{1}, c_{2}, \ldots, c_{N}$  of which optimizer in the pool to apply at each time step, producing updates  $\theta_{i+1}^{(C)} = \theta_{i}^{(C)} - T_{c_{i}}(\pmb{g}_{i})$ . The objective of the choice optimizer is to minimize the meta loss  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{meta}}(C; \pmb{x})$  with respect to these choices  $c_{1:N}$ . We parameterize the choice function  $C$  as a small two-layer LSTM, and train it by gradient descent. The LSTM takes the outputs of each optimizer in the pool, the layer type, and time step as inputs. To make it easier to train  $C$  by truncated back-propagation through time, we relax the choices  $c_{1:N}$  to instead be soft choices  $\pmb{c}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{|\pmb{T}|}: c_{i} \geq 0, ||\pmb{c}_{i}||_{1} = 1$ , resulting in the policy  $\theta_{i+1}^{(C)} = \theta_{i}^{(C)} - \sum_{j=1}^{|T|} c_{i}^{(j)} T_{j}(\pmb{g}_{i})$ . Now, we use  $C$  as a teacher to produce our final loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {c h o i c e}} = \mathcal {L} _ {\text {m e t a}} (\phi ; \boldsymbol {x}) + \alpha \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \log \left\| \theta_ {i} ^ {(P)} - \theta_ {i} ^ {(C)} \right\| _ {2}. \tag {4}
$$

# 4 STABILITY-AWARE OPTIMIZER AMALGAMATION

# 4.1 MOTIVATION

Modern optimization, even analytical, is subject to various forms of noise. For example, stochastic first-order method are accompanied with gradient noise (Devolder et al., 2011; Gorbunov et al., 2020; Simsekli et al., 2019) which is often highly non-Gaussian and heavy-tail in practice. Any non-convex optimization could reach different local minimum when solving multiple times (Jain & Kar, 2017). When training deep neural networks, thousands or even millions of optimization steps are typically run, and the final outcome can be impacted by the random initialization, (often non-optimal) hyperparameter configuration, and even hardware precision (De Sa et al., 2017). Hence, it is highly desirable for optimizers to be stable: across different problem instances, between multiple training runs for the same problem, and throughout each training run (Lv et al., 2017).

Meta-training optimizers tends to be unstable. During the amalgamation process, we encounter significant variance where identically trained replicates achieve varying performance on our evaluation problems; this mirrors problems with meta-stability encountered by Metz et al. (2019). While amalgamation variance can be mitigated in small-scale experiments by amalgamating many times and using the best one, that variance represents a significant obstacle to large-scale training (i.e.

on many and larger problems) and deployment of amalgamated optimizers. Thus, besides the aforementioned optimization stability issues, we also need to consider meta-stability, denoting the relative performance of optimizers across meta-training replicates.

In order to provide additional stability to the amalgamation process, we turn to adding noise during training, which is known to improve smoothness (Chen & Hsieh, 2020; Lecuyer et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2019) and in turn improve stability (Miyato et al., 2018). Note that one can inject either random noise or adversarial perturbations onto either the input or the weight of the learnable optimizer. While perturbing inputs is more common, recent work (Wu et al., 2020) identified that a flatter weight loss landscape (loss change with respect to weight) leads to smaller robust generalization gap in adversarial training, thanks to its more "global" worst-case view.

We also discover in our experiments that perturbing inputs would make the meta-training hard to converge, presumably because the inputs to optimizers (gradients, etc.) already contain large amounts of batch noise and do not tolerate further corruption. We hence focus on perturbing optimizer weights for smoothness and stability.

# 4.2 WEIGHT SPACE PERTURBATION FOR SMOOTHNESS

Weight space smoothing produces a noised estimate of the loss  $\tilde{\mathcal{L}}$  by adding noise to the optimizer parameters  $\phi$ . By replacing the loss  $\mathcal{L}(\phi, \boldsymbol{x})$  with a noisy loss  $\tilde{\mathcal{L}} = \mathcal{L}(\tilde{\phi}, \boldsymbol{x})$ , we encourage the optimizer to be robust to perturbations of its weights, increasing the meta-stability. We explore two mechanisms to increase weight space smoothness during training, by adding (1) a random perturbation to the weights as a gradient estimator, and (2) an adversarial perturbation in the form of a projected gradient descent attack (PGD).

Though new to our application, these two mechanisms have been adopted for other problems where smoothness is important such as neural architecture search (Chen & Hsieh, 2020) and adversarial robustness (Lecuyer et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2019).

Random Gaussian Perturbation In the first type of noise, we add gaussian noise with variance  $\sigma^2$  to each parameter of the optimizer at each iteration,  $\tilde{\phi} = \phi +\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I)$

Since optimizer weights tend to vary largely in magnitude especially between different weight tensors, we modify this gaussian noise to be adaptive to the magnitude of the  $l_{2}$  norm of each weight tensor  $\tilde{\phi}^{(w)}$ . For tensor size  $|\phi^{(w)}|$ , the added noise is given by

$$
\tilde {\phi} ^ {(w)} = \phi^ {(w)} + \mathcal {N} \left(0, \sigma^ {2} \frac {\left| \left| \phi^ {(w)} \right| \right| _ {2} ^ {2}}{\left| \phi^ {(w)} \right|} I\right). \tag {5}
$$

Projected Gradient Descent For the second type of noise, we use adversarial noise obtained by projected gradient descent (Appendix A, Algorithm 2). For  $A$  adversarial steps, the noised parameters are given by  $\tilde{\phi} = \phi +\psi_A$ , where  $\psi_0 = \mathbf{0}$ , and  $\psi_{i + 1} = \psi_i + \eta \operatorname {clip}_\varepsilon (\nabla_{\tilde{\psi}_i}\mathcal{L})$  for optimizer loss  $\mathcal{L}$

As with random Gaussian perturbations, we also modify the adversarial perturbation to be adaptive with magnitude proportional to the  $l_{2}$  norm of each weight tensor  $\phi$ . Here, the adversarial attack step for weight tensor  $w$  is instead given by

$$
\psi_ {i + 1} ^ {(w)} = \psi_ {i} ^ {(w)} + \frac {\varepsilon | | \phi | | _ {2} \nabla_ {\psi_ {i} ^ {(w)}} \mathcal {L}}{| | \nabla_ {\psi_ {i} ^ {(w)}} \mathcal {L} | | _ {2}}. \tag {6}
$$

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

Optimize Details All optimizers were amalgamated using a 2-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) on the MNIST (LeCun & Cortes, 2010) dataset (shortened as "Train") using a batch size of 128. During evaluation, we test the generalization of the amalgamated optimizer to other problems:

(1) Different Datasets: FMNIST (Xiao et al., 2017) and SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), using the Train architecture. We also run experiments on CIFAR (Krizhevsky et al., 2009); since the Train

network is too small to obtain reasonable performance on CIFAR, we substitute it for the Wider architecture and a 28-layer ResNet (He et al., 2015) labelled "CIFAR" and "ResNet" respectively.

(2) Different Architectures: a 2-layer MLP (MLP), a CNN with twice the number of units in each layer (Wider), and a deeper CNN (Deeper) with 5 convolutional layers.  
(3) Training settings: training with a smaller batch size of 32 (Small Batch). We also try a new setting of training with differential privacy (Abadi et al., 2016) (MNIST-DP).

The full architecture and training specifications for each optimizer is given in Appendix B.

Optimizer Pool We use two different optimizer pools in our experiment: "small," which consists of Adam and RMSProp, and "large," which also contains SGD, Momentum, AddSign, and PowerSign. Each optimizer has a learning rate tuned by grid search over a grid of  $\{5 \times 10^{-4}, 1 \times 10^{-3}, 2 \times 10^{-3}, \ldots, 1\}$ . The selection criteria is the best validation loss after 5 epochs for the Train network on MNIST, which matches the meta-training settings of the amalgamated optimizer. Descriptions of the optimizers used and other hyperparameters are detailed in Appendix C.1.

Baselines First, we compare our amalgamated optimizer against our analytical optimizer teachers which are combined into a "oracle optimizer," which is the optimizer in our pool of teachers with the best validation loss. Then, we evaluate previous learned optimizer methods: the original "Learning to Learn by Gradient Descent by Gradient Descent" optimizer Andrychowicz et al. (2016) which we refer to as "Original", RNNProp (Lv et al., 2017), which we refer to as "Scale", and the best setup from Chen et al. (2020a) which shorten as "Stronger Baselines."

Training and Evaluation Details The RNNProp amalgamation target was trained using truncated backpropagation though time with a constant truncation length of 100 steps and total unroll of up to 1000 steps and meta-optimized by Adam with a learning rate of  $1 \times 10^{-3}$ . For our training process, we also apply random scaling (Lv et al., 2017) and curriculum learning (Chen et al., 2020a); more details about amalgamation training are provided in Appendix C.2.

For each optimizer amalgamation configuration tested, we independently trained 8 replicate optimizers. Then, each replicate was evaluated 10 times on each evaluation problem, and trained to a depth of 25 epochs each time. Finally, we measure the stability of amalgamated optimizers by defining three notions of stability for meta-trained optimizers:

(1) Optimization stability: the stability of the optimizer during the optimization process. Viewing stability of the validation loss as a proxy for model stability with respect to the true data distribution, we measure the epoch-to-epoch variance of the validation loss after subtracting a smoothed validation loss curve (using a Gaussian filter).  
(2) Evaluation stability: the variance of optimizer performance across multiple evaluations. We find that the evaluation stability is roughly the same for all optimizers (Appendix E.1).  
(3) Meta-stability: the stability of the amalgamation process, i.e. the variance of amalgamation replicates after correcting for evaluation variance. Meta-stability and evaluation stability are jointly estimated using a linear mixed effects model.

Each definition of stability is reported as a standard deviation; more details are given in Appendix D.

Figure 2: Comparison with other learned optimizers; for each problem,  $95\%$  confidence intervals of the mean are computed using a linear mixed effects model (Appendix D). Error bars are normalized by subtracting the mean log validation loss of the amalgamated optimizer to use the same Y-axis. An uncropped and accuracy version can be found in Appendix E.2. The amalgamated optimizer performs better than other learned optimizers on all problems, and is significantly better except in some problems when compared to the Stronger Baselines trained RNNProp (Chen et al., 2020a).

The title of each plot corresponds to an optimizee; full definitions can be found in Appendix B. An version of this plot showing validation accuracy can be found in Appendix E.2. The amalgamated optimizer performs similarly or better than the Oracle analytical optimizer on problems spanning a variety of training settings, architectures, and datasets.

# 5.1 OPTIMIZER AMALGAMATION

Amalgamation Methods Figure 1 compares the mean performance of the three amalgamation methods with the small pool and Choice amalgamation with the large pool. Mean and min-max amalgamation were not performed on the large pool due to memory constraints. The amalgamated optimizers using optimal choice amalgamation perform better than Mean and Min-Max amalgamation. The size of the optimizer pool does not appear to have a significant effect in Optimal Choice amalgamation, with small pool and large pool amalgamated optimizers obtaining similar results.

Previous Learned Optimizers Figure 2 compares the amalgamated optimizer against the baselines from Learning to Optimize. Optimizer amalgamation performs significantly better than all previous methods on all problems, with few exceptions (where it performs better but not significantly better).

Analytical Optimizers In Figure 4, we compare the best replicate amalgamated from the large pool using Choice amalgamation with the "oracle optimizer" described above. The amalgamated optimizer achieves similar or better validation losses than the best analytical optimizers, indicating that our amalgamated optimizer indeed captures the "best" loss-minimization characteristics of each optimizer.

The amalgamated optimizer also benefits from excellent optimization stability, meeting or exceeding the optimization stability of the best analytical optimizers in the large pool (Figure 5). Comparing analytical optimizers, we ob

Figure 5: Optimization stability (lower is more stable) of an optimizer amalgamated by Optimal Choice from the large pool compared to optimization stability of the optimizers in that pool;  $95\%$  confidence intervals are shown. A larger version of this figure showing training loss and validation loss as well is provided in Appendix E.2.

serve a general inverse relationship between optimization performance and optimization stability: in order to achieve better optimization, an optimizer typically sacrifices some optimization stability in order to move faster through the optimizeee weight space. By integrating problem-specific knowledge, the amalgamated optimizer is able to combine the best optimization performance and optimization stability characteristics (Figure 3).

# 5.2 STABILITY-AWARE OPTIMIZER AMALGAMATION

Input Perturbation While we also tested perturbing the inputs of the optimizer during amalgamation, we were unable to improve stability. These experiments are included in Appendix E.3.

Random Perturbation Min-max amalgamation was trained on the small optimizer pool with random perturbation relative magnitudes of  $\varepsilon = \{5\times 10^{-4},10^{-3},2\times 10^{-3},5\times 10^{-3},10^{-2}\}$ .  $\varepsilon = 10^{-1}$  was also tested, but all replicates tested diverged and are not reported here.

Comparing perturbed amalgamation against the nonperturbed baseline  $(\varepsilon = 0)$ , we observe that perturbations increase meta-stability up to about  $\varepsilon = 10^{-3}$  (Figure 6). For larger perturbation magnitudes, meta-stability begins to decrease as the perturbation magnitude overwhelms the weight "signal," eventually causing the training process to completely collapse for larger perturbation values. While the stability with random perturbation  $\varepsilon = 10^{-2}$  is better than  $10^{-3}$ , this is likely due to random chance, since we use a small sample size of 8 replicates.

Figure 6: Amalgamation meta-stability for varying magnitudes of random and adversarial perturbations (lower is better). Meta-stability is measured by the variance across replicates of the training loss after 25 epochs on the Train convolutional network, adjusted for the variance of evaluation.

Adversarial Perturbation Since adversarial perturbation is more computationally expensive than random perturbations, min-max amalgamation was tested on a coarser grid of relative magnitudes  $\varepsilon = \{10^{-4}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-2}\}$ , and to an adversarial attack depth of 1 step. These results are also reported in Figure 6, with  $\varepsilon = 10^{-2}$  omitted since all replicates diverged during training.

From our results, we observe that adversarial perturbations are about as effective as random perturbations. We also observe that the maximum perturbation magnitude that the amalgamation process can tolerate is much smaller for adversarial perturbations compared to random perturbations, likely because adversarial perturbations are much "stronger."

# 6 CONCLUSION

We define the problem of optimizer amalgamation, which we hope can inspire better and faster optimizers for researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we provide a procedure for optimizer amalgamation, including differentiable optimizer amalgamation mechanisms and amalgamation stability techniques. Then, we evaluate our problem on different datasets, architectures, and training settings to benchmark the strengths and weaknesses of our amalgamated optimizer. In the future, we hope to bring improve the generalizability of amalgamated optimizers to even more distant problems.
