# ABSTRACT

Inspired by the success of self-supervised autoregressive representation learning in natural language (GPT and its variants), and advances in recent visual architecture design with Vision Transformers (ViTs), in this paper, we explore the effect various design choices have on the success of applying such training strategies for visual feature learning. Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy that we call Random Segments with Autoregressive Coding (RandSAC). In RandSAC, we group patch representations (image tokens) into hierarchically arranged segments; within each segment, tokens are predicted in parallel, similar to BERT, while across segment predictions are sequential, similar to GPT. We illustrate that randomized serialization of the segments significantly improves the performance and results in distribution over spatially-long (across-segments) and -short (within-segment) predictions which are effective for feature learning. We illustrate the pertinence of these design choices and explore alternatives on a number of datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet). While our pre-training strategy works with vanilla Transformer, we also propose a conceptually simple, but highly effective, addition to the decoder that allows learnable skip-connections to encoder's feature layers, which further improves the performance.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep learning has powered enormous successes in Computer Vision and NLP over the past 10, or so, years. It has lead to significant improvements in object detection (Redmon et al., 2016), segmentation (He et al., 2017), as well as higher-level cognition tasks (e.g., Visual Question Answering (Antol et al., 2015), Visual Navigation (Mayo et al., 2021), etc.). These successes have been enabled by both advances in parallel hardware (GPUs) and, perhaps more importantly, large-scale task-specific labeled datasets that allow supervised learning. This appetite for large data has, until very recently, stagnated progress, particularly in building general-purpose visual architectures.

These types of considerations date back to the early days of machine learning, and deep learning in particular, where it has long been postulated that unsupervised, or self-supervised, learning could allow learning of robust and general feature representations that can then be readily used (or finetuned) to target tasks. Self-supervised learning has been explored in computer vision in various forms: denoising autoencoders (Pathak et al., 2016; Vincent et al., 2008), colorization (Zhang et al., 2016) or jigsaw puzzle (Doersch et al., 2015; Noroozi & Favaro, 2016) proxy objectives. However, the success of such self-supervised pre-training was somewhat limited. In contrast, the success of similar self-supervised ideas in NLP has been much more dominant with GPT (Brown et al., 2020) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) architectures, and their variants. These pre-training strategies now enable state-of-the-art performance on a wide array of natural language tasks.

Recent advances in vision architectures, such as Vision Transformers (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), which serialize visual 2d data, have opened an opportunity to apply similar large scale pre-training techniques in vision, with increasing successes. Self-supervised pre-training techniques with ViTs can be characterized into two broad categories: contrastive and predictive; as well as their combinations. In contrastive learning, pre-training architectures are learned to be invariant to certain perturbations in data (e.g., spatial shifts, color jitter) by forming positive and negative pairings of augmented data samples. This is a powerful technique, but requires designers to make assumptions about invariances that the architecture should learn. In addition, purely

Figure 1: Randomized Autoregressive Segment Prediction. Illustration of our autoregressive segment prediction framework (RandSAC). RandSAC breaks the image into tokens which are arranged into segments (here squares of size  $2 \times 2$ ). The autoregressive (GPT-style) transformer-based model is then trained to predict segments in a randomly sampled serialization order. As a result, tokens within segments are predicted in parallel, while segments themselves are predicted sequentially.

contrastive models tend to incorporate center bias (Chen et al., 2022; 2021a), which makes them less transferable for tasks such as segmentation where non-object centric regions need to be modeled. Alternatively, predictive models learn to predict elements of the scene, either in parallel by reconstructing masked regions/tokens (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021) (a.k.a., masked image modeling or BERT-style pre-training) or to predict images in auto-regressive language-modeling manner (Chen et al., 2020a) (a.k.a., GPT-style pre-training). It is interesting to observe that on the NLP side, GPT models have shown to be powerful, while vision models have gravitated more towards BERT-style pre-training both with visual (Chen et al., 2020a; Bao et al., 2022) and multi-modal data (Lu et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020).

Motivated by this, we adopt an autoregressive pre-training strategy (see Figure 1) and ask a number of important empirical questions about the use of such pre-training and what makes it effective. Specifically, (1) we ask what granularity (scale) and shape of tokens (patches, blobs) is most effective and how it affects the performance? (2) How best to serialize predictions? For example, previous approaches, such as image GPT (Chen et al., 2020a), leveraged raster ordering. While such ordering is perhaps "optimal" from correlation and predictive/generative (van den Oord et al., 2016) points of view, we show that it is not optimal for general feature learning. We also explore (3) whether deterministic vs. stochastic tokenization and serialization are helpful. Finally, (4) we explore the effective interactions between the decoder and encoder layers; proposing a new ViT architecture that uses learned skip connections between encoder and decoder layers to improve performance.

Contributions. We make two core contributions. First, we propose a new pre-training strategy that leverages (randomly) sampled hierarchical segment cluster traversals to autoregressively train ViT models. This allows both short- and long-term spatial predictions, allowing distribution over easy and hard predictive tasks<sup>1</sup>. We note that the effectiveness of single random segment inpainting was initially observed in (Pathak et al., 2016), but is notably missing from most recent self-supervised strategies. Our pre-training strategy generalizes this observation and strategy to hierarchical and serialized predictions. Second, we propose a flexible ViT decoder that at each decoding layer learns to dynamically attend over different levels of features in the encoder. This in effect creates learned skip-connections, as compared to UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) and others that require fixed connections in a symmetric encoder-decoder design, which further improve the performance.

Discussion. The above pre-training strategy, while empirically motivated, is also loosely modeled after human vision. Humans attend to the scene by a sequence of foveal observations, where an eye shifts over a series of fixation points; such motions are called saccades. Some saccades are long-range and voluntary, while others are local and involuntary (a.k.a., microsaccades (Rolfs, 2009)). Our segments can be "viewed" as predictive foveal regions, and the hierarchical serialization of such regions as the combination of micro and macro saccades. The significant difference from human vision, is that in human vision saccades are purposeful and have been shown to be conditioned on the task (Yarbus, 1967). In contrast, our pre-training such "saccadic" movements are randomly sampled. Learning a purposeful policy for hierarchical serialization of segments, would be an interesting future work. However, this is a difficult task that is beyond the scope of this paper.

Transformer-based Natural Language Modeling. In the field of natural language processing (NLP), two dominant self-supervised language modeling paradigms are Masked Language Modeling, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), and GPT-style autoregressive pre-training (Brown et al., 2020; Radford & Narasimhan, 2018; Radford et al., 2019). Given a sentence, BERT and its variants (Lan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019) pre-train transformer encoders by predicting randomly masked out input words, referred to as tokens. Such frameworks model the bidirectional (contextual) dependencies between the visible tokens and the corrupted/masked tokens. GPT, which can be viewed as a special case of the transformer decoder, on the other hand, models the left-to-right natural order of languages. Recent advances in large-scale generative language modeling show powerful few-shot capabilities and are believed to be a promising path towards general machine intelligence. Permutation-based autoregressive model (Yang et al., 2019) was proposed to bridge the gap between autoregressive language modeling and masked autoencoding by maximizing the likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order. We take inspiration from GPT-style autoregressive pre-training in formulating our model, and focus on important aspects of mapping such strategy onto visual (ViT) models, where tokenization and serialization are not as well defined as in language.

Contrastive Image Learning. Contrastive methods (Chen et al., 2020b; He et al., 2020; van den Oord et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2020) and their negative-sample-free variants (Chen & He, 2021; Grill et al., 2020; Hua et al., 2021; Zbontar et al., 2021) have emerged as a dominant research direction for unsupervised/self-supervised visual representation learning over the past 1-2 years. By building agreement among augmented versions of the input data, image features that are invariant of those perturbations can be learned. This method implicitly assumes a set of representational invariance (e.g., color and spatial invariance). Once such representations are learned they are either used directly, or fine-tuned, to one or more downstream supervised tasks (e.g., classification, detection, segmentation). When a downstream task violates the aforementioned invariance assumptions, they display poor transferability (Xiao et al., 2021). For example, the center-bias (Chen et al., 2022) and small-object feature suppression (Chen et al., 2021a) have been observed in prior works. Masked image modeling & autoregressive image encoding, of which our method is an instance, tend to perform better in such circumstances (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021).

Masked Image Modeling. Early CNN-based masked image modeling, also known as image inpainting (Doersch et al., 2015; Pathak et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018), has shown promising results but failed to become a predominant training paradigm, in part, due to its inferior performance with respect to large-scale supervised pre-training (e.g., on ImageNet). The recent trend of incorporating transformers into vision architectures (Carion et al., 2020), or replacing CNN completely (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), by tokenizing images into a grid of non-overlapping patches, have enabled application of large scale NLP pretraining techniques in vision, e.g., (Bao et al., 2022; He et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2022). Directly applying them to image pixels, however, leads to inferior performance (Chen et al., 2020a; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). To this end, BEiT (Bao et al., 2022) proposes to predict discrete masked image tokens. Masked Autoencoder (MAE) (He et al., 2021) suggests a  $75\%$  random masking ratio for image modeling; and SimMIM (Xie et al., 2022) studies different masking strategies for pretraining. MaskFeat (Wei et al., 2021) investigates five different reconstruction targets, and SplitMask (El-Nouby et al., 2021) illustrates the ability of BEiT to train with small scale pre-training datasets. Our proposed RandSAC strategy, is related to masked image modeling, but is autoregressive in nature.

Autoregressive Image Encoding. Compared with BERT-style pre-training for vision transformers, GPT-like autoregressive models have been overlooked due to their complexity introduced by dense image pixels. In image GPT (Chen et al., 2020a), images are limited to  $64 \times 64 = 4096$  pixels. The 4096 pixels are tokenized and serialized in raster-order before feeding into a causal transformer. The quadratic time/space complexity of self-attention prevents the scaling of such approaches.

# 3 RANDOM SEGMENT WITH AUTOREGRESSIVE CODING

RandSAC learns representations through autoregressive image segment prediction. It partitions a tokenized image into random spatially coherent non-overlapping (hierarchical) segments, serializes them, and then autoregressively predicts tokens within these ordered segments. As a result, the token

predictions between segments are sequential, while within a segment are parallel. This training strategy has four important components that we will explore:

- Tokenization. To use a transformer-based architecture, images need to be tokenized, i.e., transformed into a set of basic image elements. For example, some approaches discretize images (Bao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2020a), while others patchify them (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; He et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2022). Tokenization strategy dictates the scale and number of tokens, which affects performance and computation cost.  
- Segment Partitioning. After tokenizing the image, the tokens are grouped into spatially coherent segments. Those segments are autoregressively predicted following some prescribed serialization order. The size and shape of segments and the way they are traversed can affect training and downstream performance.  
- Serialization Strategy. Localization strategy affects the traversal order of segments. In prior autoregressive modeling (Chen et al., 2020a) raster-order is assumed. We show that stochastic (i.e., randomized) serialization is much more effective.  
- Transformer Architecture. In a GPT-style autoregressive model, the target sequence is identical to the shifted input sequence throughout training. However, for random segment prediction, the target sequence order varies for each sample. To enable this, we leverage a transformer decoder which takes as input position of each token and outputs its predicted representation conditioned on the transformer encoded context. In addition, we propose a novel trainable skip-connection layer for efficient decoding.

In the following section, the default option for model architecture is the vanilla masked transformer introduced in Section 4. We experiment with two different datasets, CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) and, where appropriate, ImageNet100 (Tian et al., 2020). Evaluation protocols are described in Section 5, and implementation details are in the Supplemental. We use a simple mean square error (MSE) as our pixel reconstruction objective.

# 3.1 FROM Pixels TO TAXENS

Tokenization. We start from raster-order serialization and compare two different tokenization strategies introduced by iGPT (Chen et al., 2020a) and ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Assume a dataset  $\mathcal{D}$  of images  $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C}$ , where  $H, W, C$  are the height, width, and the number of channels of the image. We reshape each image into  $N = HW / P^2$  patches, where  $P$  is the resolution of each patch. Tokens are obtained by linearly projecting the patches  $\mathbf{X} = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N$  and serialized row-by-row.

For pixel prediction experiment, we set  $P = 1$ , letting image patch size be  $1 \times 1$  pixels (see Figure 2 (b)). For ViT style patch prediction experiment, we split the  $32 \times 32$  CIFAR10 image into  $8 \times 8 = 64$  patches (see Figure 2 (c)), each patch consists of  $4 \times 4$  pixels ( $P = 4$ ). Note that for a fair comparison, we didn't strictly follow iGPT, where they minimize the negative log-likelihood of the quantized RGB values. We simply adopt a mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and target pixel values for all our experiments following (He et al., 2021). Note that for visualizations in Figure 2 we use a downsampled CIFAR10 image.

The results for these two tokenization options are illustrated in Table 1 (additional scales are in Supplemental) under pixel-raster and patch-raster respectively in terms of linear probing and fine-tuning accuracy (see Sec. 5.1 for definition of metrics). From the

point of view of representation learning, patches are substantially better. Further, computationally, the self-attention mechanism in a transformer uses  $O(n^{2})$  in both time and space with respect to the sequence length. Hence for pixel tokenization, the complexity is  $O((HW)^2)$ . For patches, the complexity is reduced to  $O((HW / P^2)^2)$ . In our CIFAR10 experiment, when  $P = 4$ , the complexity of training is lowered by a factor of  $P^4 = 256$ . Hence, patches result in better tokenization.

Stochastic Serialization. Randomized pretext tasks play an important role in a range of self-supervised learning algorithms. In NLP, for example, (Yang et al., 2019) improves fixed-order autoregressive language models by allowing all possible permutations of the factorization order

during training. For autoregressive ViT training of stochastic token serialization, we adopt a similar strategy by shuffling the token sequence for each image sample. Note that this does not mean that our prediction sequence is "orderless". By moving from fixed raster-order prediction to randomized sequence prediction, keeping all else the same, we observe  $20\%$  improvement in linear evaluation and  $\sim 10\%$  in

fine-tuning (Table 2 CIFAR10). Improvements on ImageNet100 are more modest (3.67% and ~2% respectively), but still significant and overall stochastic serialization is clearly superior.

# 3.2 GROUPING TAXENS INTO SEGMENTS

In this section, we introduce a concept of segments, which we define as groups (or clusters) of tokens. Effectively each segment forms an equivalency class within our serialized order, where tokens are encoded and decoded in parallel. Across segments, however, predictions are still strictly sequential. The motivation for introducing segments is two-fold. First, it allows us to reduce the overall number of autoregressive prediction steps. Second, it allows our autoregressive strategy to effectively leverage aspects of parallel, BERT-style, prediction locally. The autoregressive prediction steps can also be changed without introducing parallel prediction, simply by changing the patch size  $P$ . This is ineffective, however, as we show in Supplemental Section A.1. In what follows, we experiment with two spatially coherent segment strategies (square and blob) and then look at the importance of this spatial coherence in segment formation.

Square Segments. Once we have a grid of  $N$  patches of size  $\frac{H}{P} \times \frac{W}{P}$ , we reshape the tokens into a

set of square segments  $M \times M$ , where the  $M$  denotes the size of the square. The segment count  $K$  of an image of  $H \times W$  is thus defined by:  $K = \frac{H \times W}{(P \times M)^2}$ . For example, in our CIFAR10 experiment, an input image of size  $32 \times 32$  is tokenized into a grid of  $8 \times 8$  tokens, each of which is a  $4 \times 4$  pixel patch. We set the square size  $M = 2$ . The tokens are then split into  $(8/2)^2 = 16$  segments, which are shuffled

Table 3: Square-random serialization as a function of  $M$  on CIFAR10.  

<table><tr><td>Square size M</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>LIN(↑)</td><td>75.53</td><td>81.38</td><td>79.38</td></tr><tr><td>FT(↑)</td><td>87.52</td><td>91.38</td><td>90.23</td></tr></table>

randomly for autoregressive prediction as before. We list the representation quality with different square segment size  $(M)$  in Table 3. Since the grid size is  $8\times 8$  for CIFAR10, we chose square sizes  $M = [1,2,4]$ . Note that, when  $M = 8$ , there will be only one segment (e.g.,  $K = 1$ ) and no prediction can be made;  $M = 1$  is equivalent to no segments (i.e., patch-random in Table 2).

Blob Segments. We define blob segments as irregular elliptical segments defined by a sampled Mixture of Gaussians. To obtain  $K$  random blobs for a given image, we first sample  $K$  Gaussians with a range of means and standard deviations in the image space. Then we simply assign each token  $\mathbf{x}_i$  which is at position  $(x_i,y_i)$  to the closest mixture component using Mahalanobis distance. We illustrate the square and blob strategies in Figure 2 (e) and (f), respectively. Note that beyond the shape, blob segments allow for variability in size squares do not. See details in Suppl. Section A.2.

Analysis. As can be seen from Table 4, both square segments and blob segments surpass segment-

free patch-based autoregression (see square-random and blob-random compared with patch-random). The blob segments and square segments behave similarly. In addition, with blobs, we can easily modify the number of segments. However, with squares, the

segment number is constrained by the token number. A grid of  $8 \times 8$  tokens can either be segmented into  $4 \times 4$  or  $2 \times 2$  squares. A grid size of  $13 \times 13$  can not be divided into any kind of squares. Blob segments, on the other hand, are more flexible.

Do segments need to be spatially coherent? The idea of a "segment" puts emphasis on the spatial coherence of the tokens. The upper part of Table 5 shows the performance of feature representations with respect to the number of blob segments  $K$ . In the bottom, we randomly shuffle all tokens so that tokens in any given "segment" no longer spatially coherent. We observe that feature learning

deteriorates when segments are not spatially coherent. Note that segments without spatial coherence are still consistently better than patch-random from Table 4.

# 3.3 HIERARCHICAL SEGMENT SERIALIZATION

Images are hierarchical: a visual region of an image can often be interpreted as a component of a greater whole (Hinton, 2021) (e.g., parts make up object, object scenes, and so on). Such compositionality motivates hierarchical groupings. In our case of random segment serialization, we postulate that similar hierarchical traversal order, which adds certain degree of locality, may be useful.

In Figure 3 we illustrate this concept that we operationalize. An image is first partitioned into 16 square segments, indicated by different colors and shades. We then group these 16 segments into 4 larger partitions following the same logic for segment generation. Different colors (e.g., blue, orange, purple, and green) represent these partition groups; segments that share partition differ in shade. Hierarchical serialization is obtained by randomly, and sequentially, predicting the segments inside of each partition group (shown by the black arrows), and then jumping to another partition group at random. Note that the segment-level (local) and partition-level (global) serializations are both random. This idea can be extended to deeper hierarchies, with the depth of the hierarchy and grouping chosen based on the resolution and nature of the dataset.

Experimental results that compare flat serialization to two-level hierarchy are illustrated in Table 6. We perform these experiments on both CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 datasets. Our experiments show that hierarchical serialization and prediction consistently outperform the flat counterparts.

# 4 ARCHITECTURE

Image GPT (Chen et al., 2020a) performs autoregressive prediction by shifting the source sequence one pixel to the right. Since the raster ordering of iGPT is fixed for all samples, the position for the next target token is implicitly modeled by the transformer. In contrast, in RandSAC, the next token depends on the serialization strategy, thus can vary from sample to sample during training. Moreover, when predicting the next segment, the tokens within each segment should be predicted jointly (in parallel). This requires lateral pathways that allow communication within target segments. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose to utilize the transformer decoder.

# 4.1 MASKED TRANSFORMER FOR SEGMENT PREDICTION

A standard transformer has an encoder-decoder structure (Vaswani et al., 2017). The encoder of a transformer maps a list of tokens  $\mathbf{X} = (\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n)$  to a sequence of hidden representations  $Z = (\mathbf{z}_1, \dots, \mathbf{z}_n)$ , also known as the memory. Given  $\mathbf{X}$  and source sequence  $X_{src} = (\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_{n-1})$ , during training, the decoder masks the internal attention matrix with a causal mask and predicts the target sequence  $X_{tgt} = (\mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n)$  autoregressively. Each layer of the transformer encoder has two sub-layers: multi-head self-attention and a fully connected feed-forward network; both have residual connections. The decoder layer has a third attention sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention from the hidden representation  $Z$  to the target representation  $X_{tgt}$ . We leverage attention masking to achieve autoregressive segment prediction using this framework; we discuss details next.

Autoregressive Segment Encoder. Figure 4 shows our transformer encoder block and a decoder block. We leave out the fully connected layer and residual connections for simplicity and only show the attentions. In this visualization, there are six patches. These six patches are then grouped into three segments denoted by colors: green, blue, and red. The random segment serialization order is green  $\rightarrow$  blue  $\rightarrow$  red. One layer of transformer encoder is illustrated on the left in light green. Serialized six patches/tokens with added fixed sine-cosine positional encoding are the input to the encoder. The encoder attention is masked following the serialized segment order: segments can attend to themselves and preceding segments only. They are restricted from looking at future seg-

Figure 4: Attention-masking for Autoregressive Segment Prediction. For an image converted into a sequence of patches, we adopt a masked encoder-decoder transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) for autoregressive segment prediction. In the encoder, causal source mask enables a given segment to only attend over preceding segments and the tokens within itself. The decoder, given the position of tokens (i.e., target queries), predicts tokens within each segment conditioned on encoded previous segments (enabled by the memory mask).

ments using the, illustrated, source mask. Lastly, since the last segment does not have a succeeding segment, we only input the first four patches and leave out the two patches in the last segment.

Autoregressive Segment Decoder. The input for the transformer decoder, illustrated on the right of Figure 4 in pink, is a set of fixed positional encodings to guide the reconstruction of target segments and tokens. Similar to the encoder input where we leave out the last segment patches, in the decoder, we shift the target sequence one segment to the left and ignore the positional encodings of the first segment because it does not have a preceding segment. The self-attention layer of the decoder is masked the same way as the encoder for autoregressive segment decoding. This layer enables co-attention over preceding and current segments for context.

Evaluation. During linear evaluation and fine-tuning, both the attention masks and decoder are removed, and the encoder is used as feature extractor for the downstream supervised classification.

# 4.2 TRAINABLE SKIP CONNECTIONS

The original transformer decoder layer can only attend to the same encoder output, often from the last layer of the encoder. In contrast, CNN encoder-decoder architectures are often symmetric with skip connections between encoder and decoder layers, e.g., UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015). We hypothesize that in our design, skip-connections between transformer encoder and decoder can similarly be beneficial. To enable such skip connections, we propose a trainable skip connection module that learns how to assign encoder memory to the decoder layers. Specifically, for a transformer with  $L_{enc}$  and  $L_{dec}$  number of layers, we learn a linear layer with parameters  $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{L_{enc} \times L_{dec}}$ , such that:  $\mathbf{Z}^l = \sum_{k=1}^{L_{enc}} \mathbf{W}_{l,k} \mathbf{H}_{enc}^k$ , where  $\mathbf{H}_{enc}^k$  is an encoder representation from layer  $k$  and  $\mathbf{Z}^l$  is the formed memory for decoder layer  $l$ . Note, the linearly formed memory cells are conditioned on, and different, for each individual decoder layer. We refer the reader to the Supplemental Section A.3 for details and experiments that validate the effectiveness of this design and discuss efficiency.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

We test RandSAC in two drastically different settings: low-data and ImageNet-1K pre-training. We evaluate the classification performance of our pretrained backbone with linear probing and fine-tuning. We also test the transfer learning ability of our ImageNet pretrained model (Suppl. Sec. D.3).

General Implementation Details. We adopt minimal data augmentation strategy and use the normalized pixel value from (He et al., 2021) as our patch regression target. We obtain the reconstruction target by normalizing target pixels using the mean and standard deviation of the patch they belong. Our loss function computes the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted pixel values and patch-normalized reconstruction target.

Low-data Pretraining. Vision transformers are known to be "data hungry" (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and require a large dataset and a series of data augmentations to pretrain (Touvron et al., 2021). To experiment in such a challenging setting, we evaluate our method on small-scale datasets. We train a "square" and "blob" RandSAC models using  $16 \rightarrow 4$  and  $11 \rightarrow 5$  hierarchies respectively.

Pretraining on ImageNet-1K. ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 (Deng et al., 2009) is a popular large scale image dataset with 1.28 million images and 1000 categories. We train "square" RandSAC  $(16\to 4)$ . Detailed implementation details for all three settings are given in Supplemental Appendix B.

# 5.1 EVALUATION PROTOCOLS

Linear Probing. This measure is widely used for quantifying the quality of representation learning. It learns a linear classifier on top of the frozen feature of a pretrained encoder to classify the object-level classification labels. Then performance is evaluated using the val/test set.

End-to-end Fine-tuning. A recent study (Chen et al., 2022) shows that linear evaluation favors those methods with a center-bias such as contrastive learning. To complement linear probing, we also include 100-epoch fine-tuning evaluation. In fine-tuning, all parameters are optimized for classification. The fine-tuning recipe follows the common practice of supervised ViT training.

Table 8: Comparison on ImageNet-1K. Methods except for Autoregressive Image Modeling use image size  ${224} \times  {224}$  . RandSAC uses image size 192 for pre-training and  ${224} \times  {224}$  for evaluation.

# 5.2 RESULTS

Table 7 shows low-data classification performance for contrastive pretraining (DINO (Caron et al., 2021)), masked image encoding (MAE (He et al., 2021)) and our segment autoregressive coding (RandSAC). The MAE and DINO are pretrained using their official implementations. For MAE we use a  $75\%$  masking ratio as suggested in their paper. All models are pretrained for 1600 epochs and evaluated with both 90-epoch linear probing (LIN) and 100-epoch fine-tuning (FT). Under the low data

benchmark, RandSAC outperforms other non-autoregressive algorithms and direct supervised training, by a large margin. Both the square and the blob hierarchical versions work well. We postulate that the superior performance of RandSAC comes from randomized segment prediction pretext task. The autoregressive coding objective that we propose, which is to traverse a hierarchy of randomly serialized visual segments, diversifies the small dataset, and serves as a sort of data augmentation.

Table 8 shows ImageNet pretraining result. We compare RandSAC with contrastive transformer training approaches (DINO (Caron et al., 2021) & MoCo v3 (Chen et al., 2021b)), masked image encoding (BEIT (Bao et al., 2022) & MAE (He et al., 2021)), and our autoregressive counterpart iGPT (Chen et al., 2020a). We note, that due to limited access to computation, we were only able to run RandSAC once, without any parameter tuning. Nevertheless, RandSAC outperforms all predictive (non-contrastive methods) in linear probing, despite using a smaller image size for pretraining (192 vs 224). It is also among the best in fine-tuning (on par with MAE and better than the rest).

Contrastive models do tend to perform better in linear probing, but also differ in pre-training. For example, contrastive methods require two global crops of the input image while other methods only process one crop; DINO uses 10 local crops. In addition, linear probing for DINO and iGPT is evaluated using the last 4 and 5 transformer blocks, respectively, while MoCo v3, MAE, and RandSAC only evaluate the last block output. A longer feature vector tends to result in better linear probing accuracy (Caron et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020a). Lastly, it is worth mentioning that RandSAC can be easily combined with contrastive objectives in the future.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We present a new self-supervised pre-training strategy we call RandSAC. In doing so, we also study and provide general insights into ViT pre-training (e.g., tokenization, segmentation, and serialization). We found randomized serialization of hierarchical image segments significantly improves autoregressive pre-training of ViTs. In addition, we propose a new design for the transformer decoder, which facilitates improved performance. We show evidence that the proposed task and model could be the key to developing a powerful GPT-like model for visual representation learning.
