# ABSTRACT

Motivated by recent advances in both theoretical and applied aspects of multiplayer games, spanning from e-sports to multi-agent generative adversarial networks, we focus on min-max optimization in team zero-sum games. In this class of games, players are split in two teams with payoffs equal within the same team and of opposite sign across the opponent team. Unlike the textbook two player zero-sum games, finding a Nash equilibrium in our class can be shown to be CLS-hard, i.e., it is unlikely to have a polynomial time algorithm for computing Nash equilibria. Moreover In this generalized framework, we establish that even asymptotic last iterate or time average convergence to a Nash Equilibrium is not possible using Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA), its optimistic variant and extra gradient. Specifically, we present a family of team games whose induced utility is non-multilinear with non-attractive per-se mixed Nash Equilibria, as strict saddle points of the underlying optimization landscape. Leveraging techniques from control theory, we complement these negative results by designing a modified GDA that converges locally to Nash equilibria. Finally, we discuss connections of our framework with AI architectures with team competition structure like multi-agent generative adversarial networks.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Team competition has played a central role in the development of Game Theory (Marschak, 1955; von Stengel & Koller, 1997; Bacharach, 1999; Gold, 2005), Economics (Marschak, 1955; Gottinger, 1974) and Evolutionary Biology (Nagylaki, 1993; Nowak et al., 2004), however, the behavior of the underlying dynamics within the teams are usually sidelined. Either for reasons of mathematical convenience or bigger picture understanding, "teams" in literature are typically modeled as if they were unitary actors, i.e., single individuals without unveiling the internal decision-making of the team members (see Kim et al. (2019)).

For instance, in the biology setting of weak selection model (Nagylaki, 1993; Chastain et al., 2014; Mehta et al., 2015) species are modeled to compete as teams, while at the crux of the matter the genes of each species are the actual players and their alleles are the actions in the survival game. Similar, it was the social-media collaboration of the Reddit retail trading crowd as a team that touches off the last year's GameStop frenzy of short squeeze (Umar et al., 2021; Hasso et al., 2021) transforming the markets into a tug of war game against the team of Wall Street hedge funds.

Recently, these intrinsic details behind the competition among teams has attracted renewed interest in the Machine Learning community, motivated by the advent of multi-agent systems that are used for generative tasks or playing to complex games like CTF (Jaderberg et al., 2019) or Starcraft (Vinyals et al., 2019). So as to win this kind of games, self-training AI systems have to develop both collaborative attributes (coordination within each team) as well as contesting ones (competition across the teams). Moreover, following the complementary thread of multi-agent generative adversarial network research, the creation of a pool by efficient incumbent agents, either in generators (Arora et al., 2017; Hoang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Tang, 2020), or discriminators (Hardy et al., 2019; Albuquerque et al., 2019) has been tested providing significant statistical and

computational benefits. In this direction, researchers strive to harness the efficacy of distributed processing, utilizing shallower networks that can learn all the while more diverse datasets<sup>1</sup>.

In order to shed some light to this persistent strain of research, the main premise of the theoretical scaffolding developed in this paper is that

The "unitary two-players" min-max approach misses the critical component of the collective strategy making within each competing team.

Our class of games. In this regard, we turn our attention to Two-Team Zero-Sum games, proposed by Schulman & Vazirani (2019b), a quite general class of min-max optimization problems that includes bilinear games as well as a wide range of non-convex non-concave games. In this class, the players fall in two teams of size  $k_{1}, k_{2}$  and submit their own probabilistic strategy vector independently, akin to a general normal form multi-player game. Following the econometric common value assumption of Marschak (1955), what makes a group of players a team is that in any outcome the players of each team receive identical payoff. Thus, to build some intuition, it is easy to see that if perfect coordination existed within each team, the interaction between the teams is merely a zero-sum game between two "virtual" players. To streamline our presentation here, we defer the more precise description of our model to Section 2.

Challenges behind Two-Team Zero-Sum games. In the archetypical case of two players, i.e.,  $(k_{1} = k_{2} = 1)$ , min-max strategies are typically thought of as the axiomatically correct predictions thanks to the seminal Von Neumann's minmax theorem (Von Neumann, 1928). Unfortunately min-max optimization for case  $k > 1$  is a much more tenuous affair: Schulman & Vazirani (2019b) preclude the existence of unique value by presenting a family of team games where min max  $\neq$  max min together with bounds about this duality gap, which quantifies exactly the effect of exchanging the order of strategy commitment either between the teams or the players thereof.

If defining the correct figure of merit for Team games is rife with frustration, what is even more demanding is understanding what kind of algorithms/dynamics are able to solve this problem when a game-theoretically meaningful solution exists: Firstly, computing local Nash Equilibria (NE) in general non-convex non-concave games are PPAD-complete (Daskalakis et al., 2009; 2021). Thus, all well-celebrated first-order methods, like gradient descent-ascent (Lin et al., 2020; Daskalakis & Panageas, 2019), its optimistic (Popov, 1980; Daskalakis & Panageas, 2018; Mertikopoulos et al., 2019) and extragradient variant (Korpelevich, 1976) would require an exponential number of steps in the parameters of the problem to find an approximate NE under Nemirovsky-Yudin (Nemirovskij & Yudin, 1983) oracle optimization model. Secondly, even if a regret notion could be defined, no-regret methodology is guaranteed to attract only to the set of coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) (Fudenberg, 1991; Hannan, 2016; Flokas et al., 2020; Giannou et al., 2021), a weaker notion that may be exclusively supported on strictly dominated strategies, even for simple symmetric two-player games (See also Viossat & Zapechelyuk (2013)).

Whilst the aforementioned intractability failures for the general case of non-convex non-concave min-max problems provides significant insights, they can not a fortiori answer the fundamental question, restricted in the model of Two-Team Zero-Sum Games:

Can we compute Nash equilibria in Two-Team Zero-Sum Games and ultimately are there first order methods which converge to them under tangible guarantees?

Our results. To the best of our knowledge, the following contributions are the first-of-its kind type of results for the case of Two-Team Zero-Sum games:

- For the case of computational complexity of approximate (possibly mixed) NE we establish a sweeping negative result proving that it is CLS-hard (Theorem 3.1), i.e., is computationally harder of finding pure NE in a congestion game or finding approximate gradient descent fixed points.  
- From optimization perspective, we settle these questions with a resounding "no" for all the well-known discrete gradient flow variations. Specifically, we present a simple family of two-team with two-players zero-sum games where Projected-GDA, Optimistic-GDA and Extra Gradient fail even

to stabilize around a mixed NE, when they are initialized nearby (Theorem 3.5). Additionally, for the category GDA in the non-degenerate team games with unique mixed NE, one could acquire an even stronger result for any high-dimensional configuration of actions and players. (Theorem 3.2)

- In order to make some substantial headway under the burden of the above instability results, we shift our attention on adaptive control generalizations of the celebrated Washout filters—traditionally used for stabilizing the Dutch-roll motion of an aircraft during a flight (Hassouneh et al., 2004; Grant & Reid, 1997). Inspired by this framework, we propose the modified KPV-GDA<sup>2</sup> which consists a tandem combination of GDA together with a stabilizing feedback introduces by Bazanella et al. (1997).

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \text {s t a t e} ^ {(k + 1)} = & \text {s t a t e} ^ {(k)} + \eta G D A \left(\text {s t a t e} ^ {(k + 1)}\right) + \eta K \left(\text {s t a t e} ^ {(k)} - \text {s t r e s s} ^ {(k)}\right) \\ \text {s t r e s s} ^ {(k + 1)} = & \text {s t r e s s} ^ {(k)} + \eta P \left(\text {s t a t e} ^ {(k)} - \text {s t r e s s} ^ {(k)}\right) \end{array} \right. \tag {KPV-GDA}
$$

The main linchpin of KPV-GDA method is the Simon's and Theil's (Simon, 1956; Theil, 1957) certainty equivalence principle, a widely used methodology in Control theory in developing applied dynamic rational expectations models. According to this principle, the feedback law is split into two optimization steps whereby  $K$ -step attracts quickly the state to the stress while  $P$ -step converges slowly to the fixed points of GDA. Comparing with the plethora of the proposed dynamics for min-max problems, the crucial advantage of the afore-described technique is that does not introduce any extra fixed points than GDA's ones. In Section 2.2, we provide some illustrative examples of KPV-GDA technique, while in Theorem 3.7 we prove the existence of such control feedback for our class of games.

- Finally, in Section 4 we provide a series of experiments in simple two-team zero-sum games showcasing both the messy behaviours of traditional methods like GDA,OGDA and the power of KPV-GDA method in these optimization environments. Additionally, we show that multi-agent GAN architectures achieve better performance than the sigle-agent ones, in terms of network capacity, when their trained in synthetic or real-world datasets like CIFAR10.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

# 2.1 DEFINITIONS

Our setting. Formally, a two-team game in normal form is defined as a tuple  $\Gamma = \Gamma(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{A},u)$  consisting of  $(i)$  a finite set of players  $\mathcal{N}$ , split into two teams  $A,B$  with  $k_{A}$  and  $k_{B}$  players correspondingly such that:  $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{N}_A\cup \mathcal{N}_B = \{A_1,\dots ,A_{k_A},B_1,\dots ,B_{k_B}\}$ ;  $(ii)$  a finite set of actions (or pure strategies)  $\mathcal{A}_i = \{\alpha_1,\ldots ,\alpha_{n_i}\}$  per player  $i\in \mathcal{N}$ ;  $(iii)$  each team's payoff function  $u_{A},u_{B}:\mathcal{A}\to \mathbb{R}$ , where  $\mathcal{A}:= \prod_{i}\mathcal{A}_{i}$  denotes the ensemble of all possible action profiles  $\alpha = (\alpha_{A_1},\ldots ,\alpha_{A_{k_A}},\alpha_{B_1},\ldots ,\alpha_{B_{k_B}})$  while the individual utility of a player is identical to her teammates, i.e.,  $u_{i} = u_{A}\& u_{j} = u_{B}\forall (i,j)\in \mathcal{N}_{A}\times \mathcal{N}_{B}$ . In this general context, players could also adhere mixed strategies, i.e., probability distributions  $s_k\in \Delta (\mathcal{A}_k)$  over the pure strategies  $\alpha_{k}\in \mathcal{A}_{k}$ . Correspondingly, we define the product distributions  $\mathbf{x} = s_{A_1}\otimes \dots \otimes s_{A_{k_A}}$ ,  $\mathbf{y} = s_{B_1}\otimes \dots \otimes s_{B_{k_B}}$  as the teams' strategies. Collectively, we will write  $\mathcal{X}:= \prod_{i\in \mathcal{N}_A}\mathcal{X}_i = \prod_{i\in \mathcal{N}_A}\Delta (\mathcal{A}_i)$ ,  $\mathcal{Y}:= \prod_{i\in \mathcal{N}_A}\mathcal{Y}_i = \prod_{i\in \mathcal{N}_B}\Delta (\mathcal{A}_i)$  the space of mixed strategy profiles of teams  $A,B$ .

Similarly with the bilinear two-player games, the teams' utility functions can be expressed via the payoff-tensors  $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\in \mathbb{R}^{\tau}$  with  $\tau = \prod_{i\in \mathcal{N}}|\mathcal{A}_i|$  and acquire the form:

$$
u _ {A} = \mathbf {A} _ {\mathbf {x}} ^ {\mathcal {Y}} \& u _ {B} = \mathbf {B} _ {\mathbf {x}} ^ {\mathcal {Y}} \tag {2.1}
$$

In terms of solutions, we focus on the per player Nash Equilibrium (NE), i.e., a state strategy profile  $s^{*} = (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \left((s_{A_{1}}^{*},\ldots ,s_{A_{k_{A}}}^{*}),(s_{B_{1}}^{*},\ldots ,s_{B_{k_{B}}}^{*})\right)$  such that

$$
u _ {i} \left(s ^ {*}\right) \geq u _ {i} \left(s _ {i}; s _ {- i} ^ {*}\right) ^ {4} \text {f o r a l l} s _ {i} \in \Delta \left(\mathcal {A} _ {i}\right) \text {a n d a l l} i \in \mathcal {N} \tag {NE}
$$

The state strategy profile  $s^*$  is called pure if every player of both teams choose a single action; otherwise we say that it is mixed. Finally, a two-team game is called two-team zero-sum if  $u_A = -u_B$  or equivalently  $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{0}$ .

Remark 2.1. A quite technical prerequisite for the rest of this work, we will assume that a succinct representation of the utility tensors of the game are available or equivalently that a payoff oracle provides efficiently both the value of the utility function and its derivatives for a specific input, which is consistent with the vast majority of the applications that are described in the literature (von Stengel & Koller, 1997).

A first approach on computing Nash equilibria in Two-Team Zero-Sum games. Given the existence of the duality-gap between the min max and max min, in lieu of the two-player zero-sum game an equilibrium in our setting can not be computed via linear programming. For the goal of computing Nash equilibria in two-team zero-sum games, we have experimented with a selection of first order methods that have been utilized with varying success in the setting of two-person zero-sum case. Namely, for a given scalar, the real-valued utility function  $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{x}}^{\mathbf{y}}$ , we get:

1. Gradient Descent-Ascent

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} x _ {i} ^ {(k + 1)} = \Pi_ {\mathcal {X} _ {i}} \left\{x _ {i} ^ {(k)} - \eta \nabla_ {x _ {i}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k)}) \right\} \\ y _ {j} ^ {(k + 1)} = \Pi_ {\mathcal {Y} _ {j}} \left\{y _ {j} ^ {(k)} + \eta \nabla_ {y _ {j}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k)}) \right\} \end{array} \right.
$$

2. Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} x _ {i} ^ {(k + 1)} = \Pi_ {\mathcal {X} _ {i}} \left\{x _ {i} ^ {(k)} - 2 \eta \nabla_ {x _ {i}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k)}) + \eta \nabla_ {x _ {i}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k - 1)}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k - 1)}) \right\} \\ y _ {j} ^ {(k + 1)} = \Pi_ {\mathcal {Y} _ {j}} \left\{y _ {j} ^ {(k)} + 2 \eta \nabla_ {y _ {j}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k)}) - \eta \nabla_ {y _ {j}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k - 1)}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k - 1)}) \right\} \end{array} \right.
$$

3. Extra Gradient Method

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} x _ {i} ^ {(k + \frac {1}{2})} = \Pi_ {\mathcal {X} _ {i}} \Big \{x _ {i} ^ {(k)} - \eta \nabla_ {x _ {i}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k)}) \Big \}, \quad x _ {i} ^ {(k + 1)} = \Pi_ {\mathcal {X} _ {i}} \Big \{x _ {i} ^ {(k)} - \eta \nabla_ {x _ {i}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k + \frac {1}{2})}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k + \frac {1}{2})}) \Big \} \\ y _ {j} ^ {(k + \frac {1}{2})} = \Pi_ {\mathcal {Y} _ {j}} \Big \{y _ {j} ^ {(k)} + \eta \nabla_ {y _ {j}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k)}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k)}) \Big \}, \quad y _ {j} ^ {(k + 1)} = \Pi_ {\mathcal {Y} _ {j}} \Big \{y _ {j} ^ {(k)} + \eta \nabla_ {y _ {j}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {(k + \frac {1}{2})}, \mathbf {y} ^ {(k + \frac {1}{2})}) \Big \} \end{array} \right.
$$

where  $x_{i}^{(k)}$  (or  $y_{j}^{(k)}$ ) denotes the strategy vector of the  $i$ -th minimizing (or  $j$ -th maximizing agent) at time-step  $k$ , the step-size is denoted by  $\eta$  and  $\Pi_{\mathcal{X}_i}, \Pi_{\mathcal{Y}_j}$  are the projection operators to the corresponding simplices. The below remark will play a key role in the sequel.

Remark 2.2. Any fixed point of the aforementioned discrete time dynamics on the utility function corresponds necessarily to the Nash equilibria of the game.

Hence, an important testbed for the long-run behavior of GDA, OGDA and EG methods is to examine whether these methods stabilize around their fixed points, which consist the effectively Nash equilibria of the game. In Section 3.2, we show that in lack of pure Nash equilibria, all the above methods fail to stabilize on their fixed points even for a simple class of  $(2,2)$ -players game, and as a consequence to the mixed Nash equilibria of the game.

The presence of these results showcases the need of a different approach that lies outside purely optimization based ideas. Inspired by the applications of washout filters to stabilize highly susceptible systems and their adaptive control generalizations, we design a new incarnation of GDA vaned by two matrices-control feedback. Surprisingly, in contrast with the aforementioned traditional methods, our proposed technique accomplishes last-iterate stabilization on its fixed point, i.e., the mixed Nash equilibria of the team game.

$(K, P)$ -Vaned GDA Method. After concatenating the vectors of the minimizing and the maximizing agents  $\mathbf{z}^{(k)} = (\mathbf{x}^{(k)}, \mathbf{y}^{(k)})$  we can write our method, for appropriate matrices  $K, P$ :

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \mathbf {z} ^ {(k + 1)} = & \Pi_ {\mathcal {Z}} \left\{\mathbf {z} ^ {(k)} + \eta \binom {- \nabla_ {\mathbf {x}} f (\mathbf {z} ^ {(k)})} {\nabla_ {\mathbf {y}} f (\mathbf {z} ^ {(k)})} + \eta K \left(\mathbf {z} ^ {(k)} - \boldsymbol {\theta} ^ {(k)}\right) \right\} \\ \boldsymbol {\theta} ^ {(k + 1)} = & \Pi_ {\mathcal {Z}} \left\{\boldsymbol {\theta} ^ {(k)} + \eta P \left(\mathbf {z} ^ {(k)} - \boldsymbol {\theta} ^ {(k)}\right) \right\} \end{array} \right. \tag {2.2}
$$

Intuitively, the added variable  $\pmb{\theta}^{(k)}$  holds an estimate of the fixed point, and through the feedback  $\eta K(\mathbf{z}^{(k)} - \pmb{\theta}^{(k)})$  the vector  $\mathbf{z}$  stabilizes around that estimate which slowly moves towards the real fixed point of the plain GDA dynamic. It is crucial to note that no additional fixed points are introduced to the system.

# 2.2 TWO ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES

Our first example supports a double role: Firstly, it exemplifies how our two-team min-max competition can captures the formulation of multi-agent GANs' architectures. Secondly, it hints also an early separation between the optimization methods, since as we will see GDA will not converge to the Nash Equilibrium/ground-truth distribution.

# 2.2.1 LEARNING A MIXTURE OF GAUSSIANS WITH MULTI-AGENT GANS

Consider the case of  $\mathcal{M}$ , a mixture of gaussian distribution with two components,  $C_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(\pmb{\mu}, \pmb{I})$  and  $C_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(-\pmb{\mu}, \pmb{I})$  and mixture weights  $\pi_1, \pi_2$  to be positive such that  $\pi_1 + \pi_2 = 1$  and  $\pi_1, \pi_2 \neq \frac{1}{2}$ .

To learn the distribution above, we utilize an instance of a Team-WGAN in which there exists a generating team of agents  $G_{p}:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R},G_{\theta}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ , and a discriminating team of agents  $D_{\mathbf{v}}:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R},D_{\mathbf{w}}:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$ , all described by the following equations:

Generators:  $G_{p}(\zeta) = p + \zeta, G_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}) = \underline{\mathbf{z}} + \boldsymbol{\theta}$

Discriminators:  $D_{\mathbf{v}}^{\prime}(\mathbf{y}) = \langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{y}\rangle$ $D_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i}w_{i}y_{i}^{2}$

The generating agent  $G_{\theta}$  maps random noise  $\mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$  to samples while generating agent  $G_{p}(\zeta)$ , utilizing an independent source of randomness  $\zeta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ , probabilistically controls the sign of the output of the generator  $G_{\theta}$ . The probability of ultimately generating a sample  $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{z} + \boldsymbol{\theta}$  is equal to  $\zeta + p$ , while the probability of the sample being  $\mathbf{y} = -\mathbf{z} - \boldsymbol{\theta}$  is equal to  $1 - (p + \zeta)$ .

On the other end, there stands the discriminating team of  $D_{\mathbf{v}}$ ,  $D_{\mathbf{w}}$ . Discriminators,  $D_v(\mathbf{y})$ ,  $D_w(\mathbf{y})$  map any given sample  $\mathbf{y}$  to a scalar value accounting for the realizness or fakeness of it - negative meaning fake, positive meaning real. The discriminators are disparate in the way they measure realizness of samples as seen in their definitions.

We follow the formalism of the Wasserstein GAN to form the optimization objective:

$$
\left. \max  _ {\mathbf {v}, \mathbf {w}} \min  _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}, p} \left\{\underset {\mathbb {E} _ {z \sim \mathcal {N} (0, I), \zeta \sim \mathcal {N} (0, 1)}} {\mathbb {E} _ {\mathbf {y} \sim r e a l} \left[ D _ {\mathbf {v}} (\mathbf {y}) + D _ {\mathbf {w}} (\mathbf {y}) \right]} -} \right\} \right\} \tag {2.4}
$$

Equation equation 2.4 yields the simpler form:

$$
\max  _ {\mathbf {v}, \mathbf {w}} \min  _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}, p} \left(\pi_ {1} - \pi_ {2}\right) \mathbf {v} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {\mu} - 2 p \mathbf {v} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {\theta} + \mathbf {v} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {\theta} + \sum_ {i} ^ {n} w _ {i} \left(\mu_ {i} ^ {2} - \theta_ {i} ^ {2}\right) \tag {2.5}
$$

It is easy to check that Nash equilibria of Equation equation 2.4 must satisfy:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{r c l} \boldsymbol {\theta} & = & \boldsymbol {\mu}, \quad p = 1 - \pi_ {2} = \pi_ {1} \\ \boldsymbol {\theta} & = & - \boldsymbol {\mu}, \quad p = 1 - \pi_ {1} = \pi_ {2}. \end{array} \right\}
$$

Figure 1 demonstrates both GDA's failure and OGDA, EG and our KPV-GDA methods' success to converge to the above Nash equilibria and tantamountly to discover the groundtruth mixture.

# 2.2.2 MULTIPLAYER MATCHING PENNIES

Interestingly enough, there are non-trivial instances of two-team competition settings that even Optimistic GDA and EG Method fail to converge. Such is the case for a team version of the well-known game of matching pennies. The game can be shortly described as such: "coordinate with your teammates to play a game of matching pennies against the opposing team, coordinate not and pay a penalty". The penalty is set to  $\frac{1}{2}$ . For the interested reader, we defer to appendix A.3 the precise description of the game in a contracted tensor/table. Since every player has simply two actions, their probability vector can be represented by a single variable in [0, 1]. Considering the minimizing team x its players are  $x_{1}, x_{2}$ , while the players of the maximizing team y are  $y_{1}, y_{2}$ . The multiplayer of matching pennies is described by the utility function:

$$
u \left(x _ {1}, x _ {2}, y _ {1}, y _ {2}\right) = - x _ {1} x _ {2} - x _ {1} y _ {1} - x _ {1} y _ {2} + 1. 5 \left(x _ {1} + x _ {2}\right) - x _ {2} y _ {1} - x _ {2} y _ {2} + y _ {1} y _ {2} + 0. 5 \left(y _ {1} + y _ {2}\right) - 1 \tag {2.6}
$$

As we can see in Figures 2 and 3, multiplayer matching pennies game consists an excellent benchmark where all traditional gradient flow discretizations fail under perfect competition setting. Interestingly, we are not aware of similar examples in min-max literature and it has been our starting point for seeking new optimization techniques inspired by Control theory. Indeed, KPV-GDA variation with  $(K,P) = (-1.1\mathbf{I},0.3\mathbf{I})$  achieves to converge to the unique mixed Nash Equilibrium of the game. In the following sections, we provide theorems that explained formally this long-run behavior of the examined dynamics.

# 3 OUR MAIN RESULTS

# 3.1 ON THE COMPLEXITY OF TWO-TEAM ZERO-SUM GAMES

We start this section by showing that computing a Nash equilibrium in two team zero-sum games is computationally hard and thus getting a polynomial time algorithm that computes a Nash equilibrium is unlikely.

Theorem 3.1 (CLS-hard). Computing a Nash equilibrium in Two team zero-sum games is CLS-hard.

The main idea of the proof of Theorem 3.1 relies on a reduction of approximating Nash equilibria in congestion games, which has been shown to be complete for the interesting class of CLS, which contains the problem of continuous optimization. For consicion, we defer the proof of the above theorem to the paper's supplement.

# 3.2 FIRST-ORDER METHODS FAIL TO STABILIZE

The negative computational complexity result we proved for two team zero-sum games (Theorem 3.1) does not conclude the prospect of having algorithms (learning dynamics, first-order methods) that converge to Nash equilibria and thus can approximate them well enough. Unfortunately, we can even prove negative results about convergence to Nash equilibria in two team zero-sum games of well established methods that are commonly used and have found enormous success in classic two player zero-sum games.

In this section, we are going to construct a family of two team zero-sum games with the property that GDA, OGDA and EG fail to stabilize to Nash equilibria. This result indicates how challenging and rich the setting of team zero-sum games can be and why provable guarantees about convergence have not been established yet. Before defining the family of two team zero-sum games, we prove an important Theorem which states that GDA does not stabilize around mixed Nash equilibria. This fact is a stepping stone in constructing the family of team-zero sum games later. We present the proof all of the below statements in detail in the paper's appendix.

Weakly-stable Nash equilibrium (Kleinberg et al., 2009; Mehta et al., 2015). Consider the set of Nash equilibria with the property that if any single randomizing agent of one team is forced to play any strategy in her current support with probability one, all other agents of the same team must remain indifferent between the strategies in their support. This type of Nash equilibria is called weakly-stable. Please note that trivially pure Nash equilibria are weakly-stable. It has been shown that mixed Nash equilibria are not weakly-stable in generic games<sup>5</sup> games (Kleinberg et al., 2009). We can show that Nash equilibria that are not weakly-stable Nash are actually unstable for GDA and moreover, using standard machinery from dynamical systems, that the set of initial conditions that converges to Nash equilibria that are not weakly-stable should be of measure zero. Formally we prove that:

Theorem 3.2 (Non weakly-stable Nash are unstable). Consider a two team zero-sum game with utility function of Team  $B$  ( $\mathbf{y}$  vector) being  $U(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$  and Team  $A$  ( $\mathbf{x}$  vector) being  $-U(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ . Moreover, assume that  $(\mathbf{x}^*,\mathbf{y}^*)$  is a Nash equilibrium of full support that is not weakly-stable. It follows that the set of initial conditions so that GDA converges to  $(\mathbf{x}^*,\mathbf{y}^*)$  is of measure zero for stepsize  $\eta < \frac{1}{L}$  where  $L$  is the Lipschitz constant of  $\nabla U$ .

# 3.3 GENERALIZED MATCHING PENNIES (GMP)

Inspired by Theorem 3.2, in this section we construct a family of team zero-sum games so that GDA, OGDA and EG methods fail to converge (if the initialization is a random point in the simplex, the probability of convergence of the aforementioned methods is zero). The intuition is to construct a family of games, each of which has only mixed Nash equilibria (that are not weakly-stable), i.e., the constructed games should lack pure Nash equilibria; using Theorem 3.2, it would immediately imply our claim for GDA. It turns out that OGDA and EG also fail to converge for the same family.

Definition of GMP. Consider a setting of two teams (Team  $A$ , Team  $B$ ), each of which has  $n = 2$  players. Inspired by the standard matching pennies game and the game defined in Schulman & Vazirani (2019a), we allow each agent  $i$  to have two strategies/actions that is  $S = \{H, T\}$  for both teams with  $2^4$  possible strategy profiles. In case all the members of a Team choose the same strategy say  $H$  or  $T$  then the Team "agrees" to play  $H$  or  $T$  (otherwise the Team "does not agree").

Thus, in the case both teams "agree", the payoff of each team is actually the payoffs for the two player matching pennies. If one team "agrees" and the other does not, the team that "agrees" gets

![](images/683280b0ddf705394f54eb03ccecd0127ddb7d0e60874318511f7ce3d1c98c3f.jpg)  
Figure 4: Parameter training of the configuration under different algorithms

payoff  $\omega \in (0,1)$  and the other team gets penalty  $\omega$ . If both teams fail to "agree", both team get payoff zero. Let  $x_{i}$  with  $i \in \{1,2\}$  be the probability that agent  $i$  of Team  $A$  chooses  $H$  and  $1 - x_{i}$  the probability that she chooses  $T$ . We also denote  $\mathbf{x}$  the vector of probabilities for Team  $A$ . Similarly, we denote  $y_{i}$  for  $i \in \{1,2\}$  be the probability that agent  $i$  of Team  $B$  chooses  $H$  and  $1 - y_{i}$  the probability that she chooses  $T$  and  $\mathbf{y}$  the probability vector.

The first fact about the game that we defined is that for  $\omega \in (0,1)$ , there is only one Nash equilibrium  $(\mathbf{x}^{*},\mathbf{y}^{*})$ , which is the uniform, i.e.,  $x_{1}^{*} = x_{2}^{*} = y_{1}^{*} = y_{2}^{*} = \frac{1}{2}$  for all agents  $i$ .

Lemma 3.3 (GMP has a unique Nash). The Generalized Matching Pennies game exhibits a unique Nash equilibrium which is  $(\mathbf{x}^{*},\mathbf{y}^{*}) = ((\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}),(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}))$

Remark 3.4. The fact that the game we defined has a unique Nash equilibrium that is in the interior of  $[0,1]^4$  is really crucial for our negative convergence results later in the section as we will show that it is not weakly-stable Nash equilibrium and the negative result about GDA will be a corollary due to Theorem 3.2. Please also note that if  $\omega = 1$  then there are more Nash equilibria, in particular the  $(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{0}),(1,\mathbf{0}),(0,\mathbf{1}),(1,\mathbf{1})$  are also Nash equilibria (which are pure).

The following Theorem is the main (negative) result of this section.

Theorem 3.5 (GDA, OGDA, EG fail). Consider GMP game with  $\omega \in (0,1)$ . Assume that  $\eta_{GDA} < \frac{1}{4}$ ,  $\eta_{OGDA} < \frac{1}{8}$  and  $\eta_{EG} < \frac{\omega}{2}$  (bound on the stepsize for GDA, OGDA and EG methods respectively). It holds that the set of initial conditions so that GDA, OGDA, EG converge (stabilize to any point) is of measure zero.

Remark 3.6 (Average iterate also fails). One might ask what happens when we consider average iterates instead of last iterate. It is well-known fact Syrgkanis et al. (2015) that the average iterate of no-regret algorithms converges to course-correlated equilibria (CCE) so we expect that the average iterate stabilizes. Nevertheless, CCE might not be Nash equilibria. Indeed we can construct examples in which the average iterate of GDA, OGDA and EG experimentally fails to stabilize to Nash equilibria. In particular we consider a slight modification of GMP; players and strategies are the same but the payoff matrix has changed and can be found below (table on the right):

Figure 4 illustrates that the average iterates of GDA, OGDA, and EG stabilizes to points that are not Nash equilibria. Note that since our method (see next subsection) converges locally, the average iterate should converge locally to a Nash equilibrium.

# 3.4 WASH-OUT FILTERS & ADAPTIVE CONTROL

The aforementioned results indicate that to answer the tantalizing question of finding NE in two-team zero-sum games, our machiner should be broaden outside the limits of textbook optimization arsenal. The mainstay on this effort and our positive result is KPV-GDA method defined in (2.2), inspired by the adaptive control toolbox and washout filters. Our main statement shows that KPV-GDA stabilizes around any Nash equilibrium for appropriate choices of matrices  $K, P$ . The formal theorem is given below:

Theorem 3.7 (KPV stabilizes). Consider a team zero-sum game so that the utility of Team  $B$  is  $U(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$  and hence the utility of Team  $A$  is  $-U(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$  and a Nash equilibrium  $(\mathbf{x}^{*},\mathbf{y}^{*})$  of the game. Moreover we assume

$$
\left( \begin{array}{c c} - \nabla_ {\mathbf {x x}} U (\mathbf {x} ^ {*}, \mathbf {y} ^ {*}) & - \nabla_ {\mathbf {x y}} U (\mathbf {x} ^ {*}, \mathbf {y} ^ {*}) \\ \nabla_ {\mathbf {y x}} U (\mathbf {x} ^ {*}, \mathbf {y} ^ {*}) & \nabla_ {\mathbf {y y}} U (\mathbf {x} ^ {*}, \mathbf {y} ^ {*}) \end{array} \right) i s i n v e r t i b l e.
$$

For any fixed stepsize  $\eta > 0$ , we can always find matrices  $K, P$  so that GDA-KPV method defined in (2.2) converges locally to  $(\mathbf{x}^*, \mathbf{y}^*)$ .

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section we perform a series of numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings. Our experiment setting includes a 2-D Gaussian Mixture Model with 8 modes. Our architecture includes 8 "shallow" generators and discriminators with 2 layers of 2-16-2 ReLUs activations, compared with a giant single-agent GAN with 4 layers of 2-128-256-1024-2 activations. Interestingly, the giant one fails in a double sense; It appears both mode-collapsing and mode-drop phenomena without stabilizing. On the other hand our architecture with a small number of neurons achieves to We defer an execution of multi-generators multi-discriminators architectures for CIFAR-10 again to the paper's supplement.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS AND OPEN PROBLEMS

In this paper, we have presented a number of negative results about the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in team zero-sum games and moreover about the inability of commonly used methods for min-max optimization such as GDA, OGDA and EG to stabilize. We also presented a method (called KPV-GDA) that manages to stabilize around Nash equilibria. Given these results, a number of interesting open questions emerge.

Open Questions. One question for future consideration is the global convergence and the rates of convergence of KPV method. We believe that KPV converges globally for appropriate choice of matrices  $K, P$ . One other possible direction is to find a systematic way to get the matrices  $K, P$ .
