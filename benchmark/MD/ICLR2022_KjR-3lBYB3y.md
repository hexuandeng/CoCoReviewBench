# ABSTRACT

A robot operating in a household makes observations of multiple objects as it moves around over the course of days or weeks. The objects may be moved by inhabitants, but not completely at random. The robot may be called upon later to retrieve objects and will need a long-term object-based memory in order to know how to find them. In this paper, we combine some aspects of classic techniques for data-association filtering with modern attention-based neural networks to construct object-based memory systems that consume and produce high-dimensional observations and hypotheses. We perform end-to-end learning on labeled observation trajectories to learn both the internal transition and observation models. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness on a sequence of problem classes of increasing difficulty and show that it outperforms clustering-based methods, classic filters, and unstructured neural approaches.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Consider a robot operating in a household, making observations of multiple objects as it moves around over the course of days or weeks. The objects may be moved by the inhabitants, even when the robot is not observing them, and we expect the robot to be able to find any of the objects when requested. We will call this type of problem entity monitoring. It occurs in many applications, but we are particularly motivated by the robotics applications where the observations are very high dimensional, such as images or point clouds. Such systems need to perform online data association, determining which individual objects generated each observation, and state estimation, aggregating the observations of each individual object to obtain a representation that is lower variance and more complete than any individual observation. This problem can be addressed by an online recursive filtering algorithm that receives a stream of object detections as input and generates, after each input observation, a set of hypotheses corresponding to the actual objects observed by the agent.

When observations are closely spaced in time and objects only briefly go out of view, the entity monitoring problem becomes the well studied problem of object tracking. In contrast, in this paper, we are interested in studying the more generalized entity monitoring problem, where a robot must associate a set of sparse and temporally separated observations of objects over the course of days or weeks into a coherent estimate of the underlying objects in a scene (Figure 1). In such a setting, it is important that the system does not depend on continuous visual tracking, as any individual object may be seen at one time and then again significantly later.

A classical solution to the entity monitoring problem, developed for the tracking case but extensible to other dynamic settings, is a data association filter (DAF) (the tutorial of Bar-Shalom et al. (2009) provides a good introduction). A Bayes-optimal solution to this problem can be formulated, but it requires representing a number of possible hypotheses that grows exponentially with the number of observations. A much more practical, though less robust, approach is a maximum likelihood DAF (ML-DAF), which commits, on each step, to a maximum likelihood data association: the algorithm maintains a set of object hypotheses, one for each object (generally starting with the empty set) and for each observation it decides to either: (a) associate the observation with an existing object hypothesis and perform a Bayesian update on that hypothesis with the new data, (b) start a new object hypothesis based on this observation, or (c) discard the observation as noise. As the number of entities in the domain and the time between observations of the same entity increase, the problem becomes more difficult and the system can begin to play the role of the long-term object-based memory (OBM) for an autonomous agent.

Objects in the domain can move both locally on the table they are on as well as to different tables (simulating perturbations induced by the inhabitants). The robot moves through the environment acquiring local, partial observations of objects and must predict the number, location, and shape of objects it has seen.

House Plan

The engineering approach to constructing such an OBM requires many design choices, including the specification of a latent state-space for object hypotheses, a model relating observations to object states, another model specifying the evolution of object states over time, and thresholds or other decision rules for choosing, for a new observation, whether to associate it with an existing hypothesis, use it to start a new hypothesis, or discard it. In any particular application, the engineer must tune all of these models and parameters to build an OBM that performs well. This is a time-consuming process that must be repeated for each new application.

In this paper, we develop a method for training neural networks to perform as OBMs for dynamic entity monitoring. In particular, we train a system to construct a memory of the objects in the environment, without prior models of the robot's sensing, the types of objects to be encountered, or the patterns in which they might move in the environment. Although it is possible to train an unstructured recurrent neural network (RNN) to solve this problem, we find that building in some aspects of the structure of the OBM allows faster learning with less data and enables the system to address problems with a longer horizon. We describe a neural-network architecture that uses self-attention as a mechanism for data association, and demonstrate its effectiveness in several illustrative problems. We first validate that our OBM can implement domain-agnostic online clustering algorithms, and performs competitively with both batch clustering strategies as well as different learned architecture. Next, we validate the approach to problems with images as observations. Finally, we illustrate its application on a realistic simulated robotic domain.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Online clustering methods In the simple setting, where object state does not change over time, the entity monitoring problem can be seen as a form of online clustering, where the assignment of data points to clusters is done online, with observations arriving sequentially and a cumulative set of hypotheses output after each observation. One of the most fundamental online clustering methods is vector quantization, articulated originally by Gray (1984) and understood as a stochastic gradient method by Kohonen (1995). It initializes cluster centers at random and assigns each new observation to the closest cluster center, and updates that center to be closer to the observation. We show that our approach can learn to outperform this online clustering method. More recent work has explored theoretical aspects of online clustering with guarantees (Liberty et al., 2016; Bhaskara and Rwanpathirana, 2020; Cohen-Addad et al., 2021).

Data-Association Filters The most classic filter, for the case of a single entity, is the Kalman filter (Welch and Bishop, 2006). In the presence of data-association uncertainty the Kalman filter can be extended by considering assignments of observations to multiple existing hypotheses in a DAF or ML-DAF. These approaches, all of which require hand-tuned transition and observation models, are described by (Bar-Shalom et al., 2009). We show that our approach can learn the underlying transition and observation models and performs comparably to ML-DAF with ground truth system dynamic and observation models.

Visual data-association methods A special case of the entity monitoring problem where observations are closely spaced in time has been extensively explored in the visual object tracking setting (Luo et al., 2014; Xiang et al., 2015; Bewley et al., 2016; Frossard and Urtasun, 2018; Brasó and Leal-Taixe, 2020). In these problems, there is typically a fixed visual field populated with many smoothly moving objects. This enables some specialized techniques that take advantage of the fact

that the observations of each object are typically smoothly varying in space-time, and incorporate additional visual appearance cues. In contrast, in our setting, there is no fixed spatial field for observations and they may be temporally widely spaced, as would be the case when a robot moves through the rooms of a house, encountering and re-encountering different objects as it does so. Our emphasis is on this long-term data-association and estimation, and our methods are not competitive with specialized techniques on fixed-visual-field tracking problems.

Learning for data association There is relatively little work in the area of learning for generalized data association, but Liu et al. (2019) provide a recent application of LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to a rich version of the data association problem, in which batches of observations arrive simultaneously, with a constraint that each observation can be assigned to at most one object hypothesis. The sequential structure of the LSTM is used here not for recursive filtering, but to handle the variable numbers of observations and hypotheses. It is assumed that Euclidean distance is an appropriate metric and that the observation and state spaces are the same. Milan et al. (2017) combine a similar use of LSTM for data association with a recurrent network that learns to track multiple targets. It learns a dynamics model for the targets, including birth and death processes, but operates in simple state and observation spaces.

Slot Based and Object Centric Learning Our approach to the dynamic entity monitoring task relies on the use of attention over a set of object hypothesis slots. Generic architectures for processing such slots can be found in (Shi et al., 2015; Vinyals et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018; Goyal et al., 2019), where we use (Lee et al., 2018) as a point of comparison for OBM due to its related attention architecture. We note that these architectures provide generic mechanisms to process sets of inputs, and lack the explicit structure from DAF we build into our model. Our individual hypothesis slots correspond to beliefs over object hypotheses, and thus relates to existing work in object-centric scene learning. Such work has explored the discovery of factorized objects from both static scenes (Greff et al., 2017; Burgess et al., 2019; Greff et al., 2019; Eslami et al., 2016; Locatello et al., 2020). Developed concurrently and most similar to our work, (Locatello et al., 2020) also utilizes slots as a means of representing a factorized object decomposition of static images. In contrast to (Locatello et al., 2020), our work focuses on the use of a set of slots to represent the evolution of uncertain object hypotheses over time, and incorporates attention and inductive biases from DAF to selectively update beliefs across time to obtain object hypotheses as well as their associated confidence.

Algorithmic priors for neural networks One final comparison is to other methods that integrate algorithmic structure with end-to-end neural network training. This approach has been applied to sequential decision making by Tamar et al. (2016), particle filters by Jonschkowski et al. (2018), and Kalman filters by Krishnan et al. (2015), as well as to a complex multi-module robot control system by Karkus et al. (2019). The results generally are much more robust than completely hand-built models and much more sample-efficient than completely unstructured deep-learning. We view our work as an instance of this general approach.

# 3 PROBLEM FORMULATION

We formalize the process of learning an object-based memory system (OBM). Formally, when the OBM is executed online, it receives a stream of input observations  $z_{1},\ldots z_{T}$  where  $z_{t}\in \mathbb{R}^{d_{z}}$ , and after each input  $z_{t}$ , it will output two vectors representing a set of predicted properties of hypothesized objects  $y_{t} = [y_{tk}]_{k\in (1..K)}$  and an associated confidence score for each hypothesis,  $c_{t} = [c_{tk}]_{k\in (1..K)}$  where  $y_{tk}\in \mathbb{R}^{d_y}$ ,  $c_{tk}\in (0,1)$ . To ensure that confidences are bounded, we constrain  $\sum_{k}c_{tk} = 1$ . We limit the maximum number of hypothesis "slots" in advance to  $K$ . Dependent on the application, the  $z$  and  $y$  values may be in the same space with the same representation, but this is not necessary.

We have training data representing  $N$  different entity-monitoring problem instances,  $\mathcal{D} = \{(z_t^{(i)},m_t^{(i)})_{t\in (1..L_i)}\}_{i\in (1..N)}$ , where each training example is an input/output sequence of length  $L_{i}$ , each element of which consists of a pair of input  $z$  and  $m = \{m_j\}_{j\in (1..J_t^{(i)})}$ , which is a set of nominal object hypotheses representing the true current state of objects that have actually been observed so far in the sequence. It will always be true that  $m_t^{(i)}\subseteq m_{t + 1}^{(i)}$  and  $J_{t}^{(i)}\leq K$  because the set of objects seen so far is cumulative.

Our objective is to train a recurrent computational model to perform as an OBM effectively in problems that are drawn from the same distribution over latent domains as those in the training set. To do so, we formulate a model (described in section 4) with parameters  $\theta$ , which transduces the input sequence

Figure 2: Architecture and pseudocode of OBM-Net. Observations are fed sequentially to OBM-Net, and encoded with respect to each hypothesis. A subset of the hypotheses are updated at each time-step, with corresponding slot counts incremented according to attention weight. Slots are then decoded, with the confidence of an output proportional to underlying slot count.

$z_{1},\ldots ,z_{L}$  into an output sequence  $(y_{1},c_{1}),\ldots ,(y_{L},c_{L})$  , and train it to minimize the following loss function:

$$
\mathcal {L} (\theta ; \mathcal {D}) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {L _ {i}} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {o b j}} \left(y _ {t} ^ {(i)}, m _ {t} ^ {(i)}\right) + \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {s l o t}} \left(y _ {t} ^ {(i)}, c _ {t} ^ {(i)}, m _ {t} ^ {(i)}\right) + \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {s p a r s e}} \left(c _ {t} ^ {(i)}\right). \tag {1}
$$

The  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{obj}}$  term is a chamfer loss (Barrow et al., 1977), which looks for the predicted  $y_{k}$  that is closest to each actual  $m_j$  and sums their distances, making sure the model has found a good, high-confidence representation for each true object, with  $\epsilon \ll 1$ :

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {o b j}} (y, c, m) = \sum_ {j} \min _ {k} \frac {1}{c _ {k} + \epsilon} \| y _ {k} - m _ {j} \| .
$$

The  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{slot}}$  term is similar, but makes sure that each object the model has found is a true object, where we multiply by  $c_{k}$  to not penalize for predicted objects in which we have low confidence:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {s l o t}} (y, c, m) = \sum_ {k} \min  _ {j} c _ {k} \| y _ {k} - m _ {j} \| .
$$

Finally, the sparsity loss discourages the model from using multiple outputs to represent the same true object, by encouraging sparsity in object hypothesis confidence (derivation in Section D):

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {s p a r s e}} (c) = - \log \| c \|.
$$

# 4 OBM-NETS

Inspired by the basic form of classic DAF algorithms and the ability of modern neural-network techniques to learn complex models, we have designed the OBM-Net architecture for learning OBMs and a customized procedure for training it from data, motivated by several design considerations. First, because object hypotheses must be available after each individual input and because observations will generally be too large and the problem too difficult to solve from scratch each time, the network will have the structure of a recursive filter, with new memory values computed on each observation and then fed back for the next. Second, because the loss function is set based, that is, it doesn't matter what order the object hypotheses are delivered in, our memory structure should also be permutation invariant and independent of the number of objects, and so the memory processing is in the style of an attention mechanism. Finally, in applications where the observations  $z$  may be in a representation not well suited for hypothesis representation and aggregation, the memory operates on a latent representation that is related to observations and output hypotheses via encoder and decoder modules.

Figure 2 shows the architecture of the OBM-Net model. The memory of the system is stored in  $s$ , which consists of  $K$  elements, each in  $\mathbb{R}^{d_s}$ ; the length-  $K$  vector  $n$  of positive values encodes how many observations have been assigned to each slot during the execution so far. New observations are combined with the memory state, and the state is updated to reflect the passage of time by a neural network constructed from seven modules with trainable weights.

When an observation  $z$  arrives, it is immediately encoded into a vector  $e$  in  $\mathbb{R}^{d_s}$ , which is fed into subsequent modules. First, attention weights  $w$  are computed for each hypothesis slot, using the encoded input and the existing content of that slot, representing the degree to which the current input "matches" the current value of each hypothesis in memory (corresponding to the  $P(\text{hypothesis\_i|obs})$

computation in DAF algorithms). To force the network to commit to a sparse assignment of observations to object hypotheses while retaining the ability to effectively train with gradient descent, the suppress module sets all but the top  $M$  values in  $w$  to 0 and renormalizes, to obtain the vector  $a$  of  $M$  values that sum to 1:

$$
w _ {k} = \frac {\exp (\mathbf {a t t e n d} (s _ {k} , n _ {k} , e))}{\sum_ {j = 0} ^ {n} \exp (\mathbf {a t t e n d} (s _ {j} , n _ {k} , e))} ; a = \mathbf {s u p p r e s s} (w) .
$$

The  $a$  vectors are integrated to obtain  $n$ , which is normalized to obtain the output confidence  $c$ .

The update module also operates on the encoded input and the contents of each hypothesis slot, producing a hypothetical update of the hypothesis in that slot under the assumption that the current  $z$  is an observation of the object represented by that slot (corresponding to computing new hypotheses given an observation and old hypothesis in DAF algorithms); so for all slots  $k$ ,

$$
u _ {k} = \mathbf {u p d a t e} \left(s _ {k}, n _ {k}, e\right) .
$$

Additionally, a scalar relevance value,  $r \in (0,1)$ , is computed from  $s$  and  $e$ ; this value modulates the degree to which slot values are updated, and gives the machine the ability to ignore or downweight an input, corresponding to rejection of outlier observations in DAF algorithms. It is computed as

$$
r = \mathbf {r e l e v a n c e} (e, s, n) = \mathrm {N N} _ {2} \underset {k = 1} {\overset {K} {\operatorname {a v g}}} \mathrm {N N} _ {1} (e, s _ {k}, n _ {k})) ,
$$

where  $\mathrm{NN}_1$  is a fully connected network with the same input and output dimensions and  $\mathrm{NN}_2$  is a fully connected network with a single sigmoid output unit. The attention output  $a$  and relevance  $r$  are now used to decide how to combine all possible slot-updates  $u$  with the old slot values  $s_t$  using the following fixed formula for each slot  $k$ :

$$
s _ {t k} ^ {\prime} = (1 - r a _ {k}) s _ {t k} + r a _ {k} u _ {k}.
$$

Because most of the  $a_{k}$  values have been set to 0, this results in a sparse update which will ideally concentrate on a single slot to which this observation is being "assigned", and correspond to the hypothesis updates in DAF algorithms.

To obtain outputs, slot values  $s_t'$  are then decoded into the outputs,  $y$ , using a fully connected network:

$$
y _ {k} = \operatorname {d e c o d e} \left(s _ {t k} ^ {\prime}\right).
$$

Finally, to handle the setting in which object state evolves over time, we add a transition module, which computes the state  $s_{t + 1}$  from the new slot values  $s_t^\prime$  using an additional neural network, corresponding to dynamic updates of hypothesis in DAF algorithms:

$$
s _ {t + 1 _ {k}} = \text {t r a n s i t i o n} \left(s _ {t} ^ {\prime}\right) _ {k}.
$$

These values are then fed back, recurrently, as inputs to the overall system.

Given a data set  $\mathcal{D}$ , we train the OBM-Net model end-to-end to minimize loss function  $\mathcal{L}$ , with a slight modification. We find that including the  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{sparse}}$  term from the beginning of training results in poor learning, but adopting a training scheme in which the  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{sparse}}$  is first omitted then reintroduced over training epochs, results in reliable training that is efficient in both time and data.

# 5 EMPIRICAL RESULTS

We evaluate OBM-Net on several different entity monitoring tasks. First, we consider a simple online clustering task and validate the underlying machinery of OBM-Net as well as its ability to generalize at inference time to differences in (a) the number of actual objects, (b) the number of hypothesis slots and (c) the number of observations. Next, we evaluate the performance of OBM-Net on an image domain in which the underlying observation space is substantially different from the hypothesis space. Finally, we evaluate the performance of OBM-Net on the complex simulated household robot domain shown in Figure 1, and validate the ability of OBM-Net to capture an object with underlying dynamics and complex properties, as well as its utility for downstream robotics object-fetching tasks. We provide additional evaluation of our approach in Sections A, B and C.

Baselines and Metrics In each domain, we compare OBM-Net to online learned baselines of LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and set transformer (Lee et al., 2018) (details in E.3), as well as to task-specific baselines. All learned network architectures are structured to use  $\sim$  50000 parameters. Unless otherwise noted, models except OBM-Net are given and asked to predict the ground truth number of components  $K$ , while OBM-Net uses 10 hypothesis slots. Results are reported

# 5.1 ONLINE CLUSTERING

Setup. To check the basic operation of the model and understand the types of problems for which it performs well, we first test our approach on simple clustering problems with the same input and output spaces, but different types of data distributions, each a mixture of three components. We train on 1000 problems with observation sequences of length 30 drawn from each problem distribution and test on 5000 problems from the same distribution. In every case, the means of the three components are drawn at random for each problem. We consider a set of five problem distributions, a Normal setting in which each component is a 2D Gaussian with identical variance across individual dimensions and components, Enlongated and Mixed settings where 2D Gaussians have more variation across different components and Angular and Noise settings where underlying distributions are non-Gaussian in nature. We provide precise details about distributions in Section E.1.

Baselines and Metrics. In addition to the online learned baselines described in Section 5, we compare our approach with following task specific clustering methods: Batch, non-learning: K-means++ (Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007) and expectation maximization (EM) (Dempster et al., 1977) on a Gaussian mixture model (SciKit Learn implementation); Online, non-learning: vector quantization (Gray, 1984); Batch, learning: set transformer (Lee et al., 2018).

Results. We compare our approach to each of the baselines for the five problem distributions in Table 1. The results in this table show that on Normal, Mixed, and Elongated tasks, OBM-Net performs better than learned and constructed online clustering algorithms, but does slightly worse than offline clustering algorithms. Such discrepancy in performance is to be expected due to the fact that OBM-Net is running and being evaluated online. On the Angular and Noise tasks, OBM-Net is able to learn a useful metric for clustering and outperforms both offline and online alternatives.

Next, we provide a qualitative illustration of execution of OBM-Net on the Normal clustering task in Figure 3 as a trajectory of observations are seen. We plot the decoded values of hypothesis slots in red, with size scaled according to confidence, and ground-truth cluster locations in black. OBM-Net is able to selectively refine slot clusters to be close to ground truth cluster locations even with much longer observation sequences than it was trained on. We provide qualitative visualization of individual modules of OBM-Net in Section A.2 as well as performance on increased numbers of clusters in Section A.4. We further provide ablations of each proposed component of OBM-Net in Section A.3.

Generalization. We next assess the ability of OBM-Net to generalize at inference time to differences in the number of input observations as well as differences in the underlying number of hypothesis slots used on the Normal distribution. On the left side of Figure 4, we plot the error of LSTM, Set Transformer, and OBM-Net as a function of the number of observations seen at inference time. We find that when OBM-Net is given more observations then seen during training time (all

Figure 4: (left) Generalization with Increased Observations. Plot of LSTM, Set Transformer and OBM-Net errors when executed at test time on different number of observations from the Normal distribution. With increased observations, OBM-Net error continues to decrease while other approaches obtain higher error. (right) Generalization with Different Hypothesis Slots. Error of OBM-Net, when executed at test time with a different number of hypothesis slots on test distributions with different numbers of ground true components. In all cases, OBM-Net is trained on 3-component problems with 10 slots. OBM-Net achieves good performance with novel number of hypothesis slots, and outperforms different instances of the Set Transformer trained with the ground truth number of cluster components as well as vector quantization.

models are trained with observations of length 30), it is able to further improve its performance, while both LSTM and Set Transformer results suffer. We believe that such generalization ability is due to the inductive bias added to OBM-Net, and provide an analysis in Section A.3. We provide additional analysis of this generalization across all distributions in Table A5 and find similar results.

On the right side of Figure 4, we investigate the generalization ability of OBM-Net at inference time to increases in both the number of hypothesis slots and the underlying number of mixture components from which observations are drawn. We compare to the set transformer and to VQ, both of which know the correct number of components at inference time. We find that OBM-Net generalizes well to increases in hypothesis slots, and exhibits improved performance with large number of underlying components, performing comparably to or better than the VQ algorithm. We further note that none of the learning baselines can adapt to different numbers cluster components at inference time, but find that OBM-Net outperforms the set transformer even when it is trained on the ground truth number of clusters in the test. We provide additional generalization analysis in Section A.1.

# 5.2 IMAGE-BASED DOMAINS

We next validate the ability of OBM-Net to perform entity monitoring on image inputs, which requires OBM-Net to synthesize a latent representation for slots, and learn to perform association, update, and transition operations in that space.

Setup. We experiment with two separate image-based domain, each consisting of a set of similar entities (2D digits or 3D airplanes). We construct entity monitoring problems by selecting  $K$  objects in each domain, with the desired  $y$  values being images of those objects in a canonical viewpoint. An input observation sequence is generated by randomly selecting one of those  $K$  objects, and generating an observation  $z$  corresponding to a random viewpoint of the object. Our two domains are: (1) MNIST: Each object is a random image in MNIST, with observations corresponding to rotated images, and the desired outputs being the un-rotated images; (2) Airplane: Each object is a random object from the Airplane class in ShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015), with observations corresponding to airplane renderings (using Blender) at different viewpoints and the desired outputs the objects rendered in a canonical viewpoint. We provide details in Section E.1 and use  $K = 3$  components.

Baselines. In addition to our learned baselines, we compare with a task specific baseline, batch K-means, in a latent space that is learned by training an autoencoder on the observations. In this setting, we were unable to train the Set Transformer stably and do not report results for it.

Results. In Table 2, we find that our approach significantly outperforms other comparable baselines in both accuracy and generalization. We further visualize qualitative predictions from our model in Figure 5. We find that our highest confidence decoded slots correspond to ground truth objects.

# 5.3 SIMULATED HOUSEHOLD ROBOT DOMAINS

Finally, we validate that OBM-Net can solve the entity monitoring task in simulated robotic settings.

Setup. We model a robot moving within a house, as pictured in Figure 1, in the PyBullet simulation environment. In this house, each problem will involve following a trajectory consisting of a sequence of 50 locations. These locations are distributed across 5-6 separate rooms, with later locations potentially revisiting earlier locations. At each location, the robot looks around and if there is a table within view (which happens about  $50\%$  of the time), it will get an observation of one of the objects

For OBM-Net, LSTM and K-means we use a convolutional encoder/decoder trained on the data. We train models with 30 observations and report MSE error.

on the table or an empty observation otherwise. Each new problem has 8 tables whose locations are drawn from a larger set of potential table locations and on each table there will be two objects drawn from a small set of classes, e.g. lamp, cushion, etc. Each object class has a characteristic stochastic movement pattern, with one object class sequentially teleporting between tables (details in appendices). The goal is for the robot to be able to construct hypotheses for each distinct object it has seen and to be able to predict for each object the table it is currently on and its location relative to the table. More precisely, the input sequence of observations  $z$  corresponds to a segmented depth map of a single object visible given the camera pose at a particular location in the trajectory (or an empty observation in the case no object is visible), as well as which table it is resting on and its positional offset relative to the table. The desired output  $y$  values are, for each object seen so far, is the predicted table  $y^{t}$  it is on currently as well its associated offsets relative to the predicted table,  $y^{o}$ .

We train on a total of 10000 randomly sampled trajectories in the same floor plan, but with new randomly drawn object instances and tables for each trajectory. We test using 1000 trajectories, with test object meshes drawn from a set disjoint from the set of object meshes used during training (but sharing the same semantic class). To test the flexibility of the approach, we consider three different configurations of object classes on tables, with the motion pattern of each of the 3 object classes illustrated in Section E.1, as well additional setup details and example observations.

Metrics. To test the efficacy of our approach, we measure to what extent each hypothesis slot  $m_{i}$  can recover both the table that the associated object is on, as well as the object's position relative to the table. We match a hypothesis slot  $k$  with each object label  $y_{i}$  by computing  $\arg \min_{k} \| y_{i}^{o} - m_{k}^{o} \| + \mathrm{Loss}_{\mathrm{CE}}(y_{i}^{t} - m_{k}^{t})$ . For each match, we report the accuracy of  $m_{k}^{t}$  matching  $y_{i}^{t}$ , and as well the mean absolute error between  $y_{i}^{o}$  and  $m_{k}^{o}$ . When the table prediction for  $y_{i}$  is incorrect, we set mean absolute error to be equal to half the table size (0.15), as reported table offsets are meaningless in that case. In this setting, both OBM-Net and associated baselines use 10 hypothesis slots.

Baselines. In addition to our learned baselines, we compare to two task specific baselines. We construct a simple clustering baseline for this problem. Given a localized input-segmented depth map, we extract object offsets by averaging all points in the point cloud associated with each segment. To associate objects dynamically across time, we use batch K-means clustering on the inferred object candidate offsets and associated table identities to obtain a set of objects. We further compare OBM-Net with the more complex spatial-temporal clustering method used in the STRANDS project (Hawes et al., 2017) to infer objects in a real robotic setup from our underlying segmented depth maps. For all learned models, we convert the segmented depth maps into downsampled 3D pointclouds.

Results. Table 3 shows that OBM-Net outperforms the baselines in both estimating the supporting tables and regressing the relative position of the objects across different number of observations. Figure 6 (left) shows the prediction error of all methods as a function of the number of steps since the robot last saw an object; observe that OBM-Net is substantially better at long-term memory than the LSTM and set transformer, and still outperforms the clustering and STRANDS baselines even with long inter-observation gaps. As an upper bound, we compare with an oracle model, which

knows ground truth object identity and dynamics (ignoring object collision). We find that OBM-Net performs similarly to the oracle model (performance across all models drops due to stochasticity), and in some cases does better, perhaps by taking account object collisions.

By adding a shape occupancy prediction head (Mescheder et al., 2019) to OBM-Net, we can also regress the underlying 3D shapes of our objects. We predict each shape at  $32 \times 32 \times 32$  resolution, decoding each occupancy at each voxel coordinate using a MLP head conditioned on a hypothesis state. Quantitatively, we find that our approach gets  $95.33\%$  accuracy compared to  $72.74\%$  accuracy obtained by a LSTM and  $73.67\%$  obtained by a set transformer when predicting voxels for each test mesh in the test set. We provide visualization of predicted shapes from OBM-Net in Figure A4.

Object fetching. Finally, we verify that object hypotheses from OBM-Net can usefully support a task in which a robot has to retrieve an object it has previously observed. First, we consider the task of finding a previously-encountered object. We train LSTM, set transformer, and OBM-Net to predict underlying object class  $y^{c}$  for each object hypothesis, as well as shape estimate and location. Given a desired object class (for example, either a plant, cushion, or bucket in configuration A)) we wish to find, the robot examines each prediction  $(y_{i}, c_{i})$  and navigates in the simulated world to look for an object of the specified class, based on predictions of  $y_{i}^{t}$  and  $y_{i}^{o}$ . We measure the number of predictions that need to be queried to find the object, as well as a overall success percentage of trials in which the robot succeeded within 10 attempts. On this task, we find that a LSTM obtains an overall planning success of  $68.75\%$  with an average number of 5.38 hypotheses investigated before finding an object. In contrast, the set transformer obtains a planning success of  $81.25\%$  with an average 4.88 attempts. We find that OBM-Net performs best and is able to find the object of the desired class  $100\%$  of the time, with an average of 2.03 hypotheses examined before finding the object.

Next, we qualitatively analyze the 3D reconstructions of each object hypothesis and its ability to support manipulation. Given a 3D reconstruction, we compute grasps on the underlying shape by looking for parallel planar surfaces large enough to accommodate the gripper. We then try to execute that grasp on the target 3D object we wish to grasp in the (simulated) real world. As illustrated in Figure 6, we find that the 3D reconstruction of object hypotheses from OBM-Net is accurate enough to enable grasping of a real 3D shape. In contrast, predictions from LSTM and set transformer baselines are significantly poorer and do not enable downstream manipulation.

# 6 DISCUSSION

This work has demonstrated that using algorithmic bias inspired by a classical solution to the problem of filtering to estimate the state of multiple objects simultaneously, coupled with modern machine-learning techniques, we can arrive at solutions that learn to perform and generalize well. Importantly, the same underlying system, with no prior knowledge about the types of observations or desired output hypotheses or the frequency of observations, is able to learn to perform data-association and state estimation to solve a variety of entity monitoring problems as well as to support an object-based memory system for a robot in a dynamically changing environment.
