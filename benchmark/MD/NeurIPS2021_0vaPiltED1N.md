# Abstract

Sequence-to-sequence learning with neural networks has become the de facto standard for sequence prediction tasks. This approach typically models the local distribution over the next element with a powerful neural network that can condition on arbitrary context. While flexible and performant, these models often require large datasets for training and can fail spectacularly on benchmarks designed to test for compositional generalization. This work explores an alternative, hierarchical approach to sequence-to-sequence learning with synchronous grammars, where each node in the target tree is transduced by a subset of nodes in the source tree. The source and target trees are treated as latent and marginalized out during training. We develop a neural parameterization of the grammar which enables parameter sharing over combinatorial structures without the need for manual feature engineering. We apply this latent neural grammar to various domains—a diagnostic language navigation task designed to test for compositional generalization (SCAN), style transfer, and small-scale machine translation—and find that it performs respectfully compared to standard baselines.

# 1 Introduction

Sequence-to-sequence learning with neural networks [53, 18, 89] encompasses a powerful and general class of methods for modeling the distribution over an output target sequence  $\pmb{y}$  given an input source sequence  $\pmb{x}$ . Key to its success is a factorization of the output distribution via the chain rule coupled with a richly-parameterized neural network that models the local conditional distribution over the next element given the previous elements (and the input). While architectural innovations such as attention [7], convolutional layers [32], and transformers [93] have led to significant improvements, this element-by-element modeling remains core to the approach, and with good reason—since any distribution over the output can be factorized autoregressively via the chain rule, this approach should be able to well-approximate the true conditional distribution  $p_{\star}(\pmb{y}|\pmb{x})$  given enough data and a powerful-enough neural network.

However, despite their excellent performance across key benchmarks these models are often sample inefficient and can moreover fail spectacularly on diagnostic tasks designed to test for compositional generalization [58, 54]. This is commonly attributed to the relatively weak inductive bias imposed by standard sequence-to-sequence models [64], which can result in learners that exhibit over-reliance on surface-form correlations rather than the underlying structure.

In this work, we explore an alternative, hierarchical approach to sequence-to-sequence learning with latent neural grammars. This work departs from previous approaches in three important ways. First, we model the distribution over the target sequence with a quasi-synchronous grammar [86] which assumes a hierarchical generative process whereby each node in the target tree is transduced by a subset of nodes in the source tree. Such node-level alignments provide provenance and a causal mechanism for how each output part is generated, thereby making the generation process more interpretable. We additionally find that the explicit modeling of source- and target-side hierarchy

with grammars improves compositional generalization compared to non-hierarchical autoregressive models. Second, in contrast the existing line of work on incorporating (often observed) tree structures into sequence modeling with neural networks [28, 4, 73, 30, 106, 1, 81, 14, 27, inter alia], we treat the source and target trees as fully latent and induce them during training. Finally, whereas previous work on synchronous grammars typically utilized log-linear models over handcrafted/pipelined features [16, 48, 97, 86, 94, 20, 34, inter alia] we make use of dense neural features to parameterize the grammar's rule probabilities, which enables efficient sharing of parameters over the combinatorial space of derivation rules without the need for any smoothing or feature engineering. We also use the grammar directly for end-to-end generation instead of as part of a larger pipelined system (e.g. to extract alignments) [103, 33, 11].

We apply our approach to a variety of sequence-to-sequence learning tasks—SCAN language navigation task designed to test for compositional generalization [58], style transfer on the the English Penn Treebank [63], and small-scale English-French machine translation—and find that it performs favorably compared to baseline approaches.

# 2 Neural Synchronous Grammars for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning

We use  $\pmb{x} = [x_1, \dots, x_S]$ ,  $\pmb{y} = [y_1, \dots, y_T]$  to denote the source/target strings, and further use  $s, t$  to refer to source/target trees, represented as a set of nodes including the leaves (i.e.  $\mathrm{yield}(s) = x$  and  $\mathrm{yield}(t) = y$ ).

# 2.1 Quasi-Synchronous Grammars

Quasi-synchronous grammars, introduced by Smith and Eisner [86], define a monolingual grammar over target strings conditioned on a source tree, where the grammar's rule set depends dynamically on the source tree  $s$ . In this paper we work with probabilistic quasi-synchronous context-free grammars (QCFG), which can be represented as a tuple  $G[s] = (S, \mathcal{N}, \mathcal{P}, \Sigma, \mathcal{R}[s], \theta)$  where  $S$  is the distinguished start symbol,  $\mathcal{N}$  is the set of nonterminals which expand to other nonterminals,  $\mathcal{P}$  is the set of nonterminals which expand to terminals (i.e. preterminals),  $\Sigma$  is the set of terminals, and  $\mathcal{R}[s]$  is a set of context-free rules conditioned on  $s$ , where each rule is one of

$$
\begin{array}{l} S \rightarrow A [ \alpha_ {i} ], \quad A \in \mathcal {N}, \quad \alpha_ {i} \subseteq s \\ A [ \alpha_ {i} ] \rightarrow B [ \alpha_ {j} ] C [ \alpha_ {k} ], \quad A \in \mathcal {N}, \quad B, C \in \mathcal {N} \cup \mathcal {P}, \quad \alpha_ {i}, \alpha_ {j}, \alpha_ {k} \subseteq s \\ D [ \alpha_ {i} ] \rightarrow w, \quad D \in \mathcal {P}, w \in \Sigma , \quad \alpha_ {i} \subseteq s. \\ \end{array}
$$

We use  $\theta$  to parameterize the rule probabilities  $p_{\theta}(r)$  for each  $r \in \mathcal{R}[s]$ . In the above,  $\alpha_{i}$ 's are subsets of nodes in the source tree  $s$ , and therefore QCFGs model a tree transduction process where each target tree node is aligned to a subset of source tree nodes. This quasi-synchronous generation process generalizes classic synchronous context-free grammars [100] and relaxes the assumption that the source tree is isomorphic to the target tree. Since the  $\alpha_{i}$ 's take values in the power set of  $s$ , the above formulation as presented is completely intractable. We follow prior work [86, 94] and restrict  $\alpha_{i}, \alpha_{j}, \alpha_{k} \in s$ , which amounts to assuming that each target tree node can be aligned to exactly one source tree node.

In contrast to standard, "flat" sequence-to-sequence models where any hierarchical structure necessary for the task must be captured implicitly within the network's hidden layers, synchronous grammars explicitly model the hierarchical structure on both the source and target side, which acts as a strong source of inductive bias. This tree transduction process further results in a more interpretable generation process as each span in the target aligned to a span in the source via node-level alignments.2 More generally, the grammar rules provide a symbolic interface to the model, and we show how this mechanism can be used to, for example, incorporate phrase-to-phrase copy mechanisms (section 2.4).

# 2.2 Parameterization

Since each source tree node  $\alpha_{i}$  is likely to occur only a few times (or just once) in the training corpus, parameter sharing becomes crucial. Prior work on QCFGs typically utilized log-linear models over

hand-crafted features to share parameters across rules [86, 34]. In this work we instead work with a neural parameterization which allows for parameter sharing without the need for manual feature engineering.

Concretely, we first represent each symbol  $A[\alpha_i]$  as an embedding,

$$
\mathbf {e} _ {A [ \alpha_ {i} ]} = \mathbf {u} _ {A} + \mathbf {h} _ {\alpha_ {i}},
$$

where  $\mathbf{u}_A$  is the nonterminal embedding for  $A$ , and  $\mathbf{h}_{\alpha_i}$  is the representation of node  $\alpha_i$  given by running a TreeLSTM over the source tree  $s$  [90, 112]. These embeddings are then combined to produce the probability of each rule,

$$
\begin{array}{l} p _ {\theta} (S \rightarrow A [ \alpha_ {i} ]) \quad \propto \exp \left(\mathbf {u} _ {S} ^ {\top} \mathbf {e} _ {A [ \alpha_ {i} ]}\right), \\ p _ {\theta} \left(A [ \alpha_ {i} ] \rightarrow B [ \alpha_ {j} ] C [ \alpha_ {k} ]\right) \quad \propto \exp \left(f _ {1} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {A [ \alpha_ {i} ]}\right) ^ {\top} \left(f _ {2} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {B [ \alpha_ {j} ]}\right) + f _ {3} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {C [ \alpha_ {k} ]}\right)\right)\right), \\ p _ {\theta} (D [ \alpha_ {i} ] \rightarrow w) \propto \exp \left(f _ {4} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {D [ \alpha_ {i} ]}\right) ^ {\top} \mathbf {u} _ {w} + b _ {w}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}, f_{4}$  are feedforward networks with residual layers (see appendix A.1 for the exact parameterization). Therefore the parameters of this model are the nonterminal embeddings (i.e.  $\mathbf{u}_A$  for  $A \in \{S\} \cup \mathcal{N} \cup \mathcal{P}$ ), terminal embeddings/biases (i.e.  $\mathbf{u}_w, b_w$  for  $w \in \Sigma$ ), and the parameters of the TreeLSTM and the feedforward networks.

# 2.3 Learning and Inference

The QCFG described above defines a distribution over target trees (and by marginalization, target side strings) given a source tree. While prior work on QCFGs typically relied on an off-the-shelf parser over the source to obtain its parse tree, this limits the generality of the approach. In this work, we instead learn a probabilistic source-side parser along with the QCFG. This parser is a monolingual PCFG with parameters  $\phi$  that defines a posterior distribution over binary parse trees given source strings, i.e.  $p_{\phi}(s \mid x)$ . Our PCFG uses the parameterization from [55]. With the parser in hand, we are now ready to define the log marginal likelihood,

$$
\log p _ {\theta , \phi} (\boldsymbol {y} \mid \boldsymbol {x}) = \log \left(\sum_ {\boldsymbol {s} \in \mathcal {T} (\boldsymbol {x})} \sum_ {\boldsymbol {t} \in \mathcal {T} (\boldsymbol {y})} p _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {t} \mid \boldsymbol {s}) p _ {\phi} (\boldsymbol {s} \mid \boldsymbol {x})\right).
$$

Here  $\mathcal{T}(\pmb{x})$  and  $\mathcal{T}(\pmb{y})$  are the set of trees whose leaves are  $\pmb{x}$  and  $\pmb{y}$ . Unlike classic synchronous context-free grammars, full marginalization over both  $\mathcal{T}(\pmb{y})$  and  $\mathcal{T}(\pmb{x})$  is intractable. However, we observe that the inner summation  $\sum_{\pmb{t} \in \mathcal{T}(\pmb{y})} p_{\theta}(\pmb{t} \mid \pmb{s}) = p_{\theta}(\pmb{y} \mid \pmb{s})$  is tractable to compute with dynamic programming (i.e. the inside algorithm [8]) in  $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{N}|(|\mathcal{N}| + |\mathcal{P}|)^2 S^3 T^3)$ , where  $S$  is the source length and  $T$  is the target length. This motivates the following lower bound on the log marginal likelihood,

$$
\log p _ {\theta , \phi} (\boldsymbol {y} \mid \boldsymbol {x}) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {s} \sim p _ {\phi} (\boldsymbol {s} \mid \boldsymbol {x})} \left[ \log p _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {y} \mid \boldsymbol {s}) \right],
$$

which is obtained by the usual application of Jensen's inequality (see appendix A.2).<sup>4</sup>

An unbiased Monte Carlo estimator for the gradient with respect to  $\theta$  is straightforward to compute given a sample from  $p_{\phi}(s \mid x)$ , since we can just backpropagate through the inside algorithm. For the gradient respect to  $\phi$ , we use the score function estimator with a self-critical baseline [76],

$$
\nabla_ {\phi} \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {s} \sim p _ {\phi} (\boldsymbol {s} \mid \boldsymbol {x})} [ \log p _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {y} \mid \boldsymbol {s}) ] \approx (\log p _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {y} \mid \boldsymbol {s} ^ {\prime}) - \log p _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {y} \mid \widehat {\boldsymbol {s}})) \nabla_ {\theta} \log p (\boldsymbol {s} ^ {\prime} \mid \boldsymbol {x}),
$$

where  $s'$  is a sample from  $p_{\phi}(s \mid x)$  and  $\widehat{s}$  is the most likely tree in  $p_{\phi}(s \mid x)$ . We also found it important to regularize the source parser by simultaneously training it as a monolingual PCFG, and therefore add  $\nabla_{\phi} \log p_{\phi}(x)$  to the gradient expression above. Obtaining the sample tree  $s'$ , the

Our use of the non-variational lower bound is implicitly assuming that  $s$  and  $y$  are conditionally independent given  $x$  (i.e. all uncertainty about  $s$  is captured by  $x$ ), which is reasonable for many language applications.

This motivates our use of a generative rather than a discriminative parser on the source side.

argmax tree  $\widehat{\pmb{s}}$ , and scoring the sampled tree  $\log p(\pmb{s}'|\pmb{x})$  all require  $\mathcal{O}(S^3)$  dynamic programs. Hence the runtime is still dominated by the  $\mathcal{O}(S^3T^3)$  dynamic program to compute  $p_{\theta}(\pmb{y}|\pmb{s}')$  and  $p_{\theta}(\pmb{y}|\widehat{\pmb{s}})$ . We found this to be manageable on modern GPUs with a vectorized implementation of the inside algorithm. Our implementation uses the Torch-Struct library [77].

Predictive inference For decoding, we first run MAP inference with the source parser to obtain  $\widehat{\pmb{s}} = \operatorname{argmax}_{\pmb{s}} p_{\phi}(\pmb{s} \mid \pmb{x})$ . Given  $\widehat{\pmb{s}}$ , finding the most probable sequence  $\operatorname{argmax}_{\pmb{y}} p_{\theta}(\pmb{y} \mid \widehat{\pmb{s}})$  (i.e. the consensus string of the grammar  $G[\widehat{\pmb{s}}]$ ) is still difficult, and in fact NP-hard [85, 13, 62]. We therefore resort to an approximate decoding scheme where we sample  $K$  target trees  $\pmb{t}^{(1)}, \dots, \pmb{t}^{(K)}$  from  $G[\widehat{\pmb{s}}]$ , rescore the yields of the sampled trees, and return the tree whose yield has the lowest perplexity.

# 2.4 Extensions

Here we show that the formalism of synchronous grammars provides a flexible interface with which to interact with the model and imbue inductive biases.

Phrase-to-phrase copying Incorporating latent copy mechanisms into sequence-to-sequence models has led to significant improvements for tasks where there is overlap between the source and target sequences [49, 68, 40, 39, 79]. These models typically define a binary latent variable at each time step that decides to either copy from the source or generate from the target vocabulary. While useful, existing copy mechanisms can typically copy at only the word-level due to the word-level encoder/decoder. In contrast, the hierarchical generative process of QCFGs makes it convenient to incorporate phrase-level copy mechanisms by using a special-purpose nonterminal/preterminal that always copies the yield of the source subtree that it is combined with. In particular, letting  $A_{\mathrm{COPY}} \in \mathcal{N}$  be a COPY nonterminal, we can expand the rule set  $\mathcal{R}[s]$  to include rules of the form  $A_{\mathrm{COPY}}[\alpha_i] \to v$  for  $v \in \Sigma^{+}$ , and define its probability to be

$$
p _ {\theta} \left(A _ {\mathrm {C O P Y}} [ \alpha_ {i} ] \rightarrow v\right) = \mathbb {1} \left\{v = \operatorname {y i e l d} \left(\alpha_ {i}\right)\right\}.
$$

The preterminal copy mechanism is similarly defined. Computing  $p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{y} \mid \boldsymbol{s})$  in this modified grammar requires a straightforward modification of the usual inside algorithm. In our style transfer experiments in section 3.2 we show that this phrase-level copying is crucial to obtaining good performance. While not explored in the present work, such a mechanism can readily be employed to embed known transformations rules (e.g. from bilingual lexicons or transliteration tables) into the modeling process.

Adding domain-specific constraints For some applications we may want to place additional restrictions on the rule set to operationalize domain-specific constraints and inductive biases. For example, setting  $\alpha_{j},\alpha_{k}\in \mathrm{descendant}(\alpha_{i})$  for rules of the form  $A[\alpha_i]\to B[\alpha_j]C[\alpha_k]$  would constrain the target tree hierarchy to respect the source tree hierarchy, while restricting  $\alpha_{i}$  to terminal nodes only (i.e.  $\alpha_{i}\in \mathrm{yield}(s)$ ) for rules of the form  $D[\alpha_i]\rightarrow w$  would enforce that each target terminal be aligned to a source terminal. We indeed make use of such restrictions in our experiments.

Incorporating autoregressive language models Finally, we show that a simple extension of the QCFG can incorporate standard autoregressive language models. Let  $p_{\mathrm{LM}}(w|\gamma)$  be a distribution over the next element given by a (potentially conditional) language model given arbitrary context  $\gamma$  (e.g.  $\gamma = y_{<t}$  for a monolingual language model and  $\gamma = [x; y_{<t}]$  for a sequence-to-sequence model). We can then add a special LM preterminal  $D_{\mathrm{LM}} \in \mathcal{P}$  with symbol embedding  $\mathbf{u}_{D_{\mathrm{LM}}}$  that is not combined with any source node, and define the associated probabilities to be,

$$
p _ {\theta} \left(A \left[ \alpha_ {i} \right]\rightarrow D _ {\mathrm {L M}} C \left[ \alpha_ {k} \right]\right) \quad \propto \exp \left(f _ {1} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {A \left[ \alpha_ {i} \right]}\right) ^ {\top} \left(f _ {2} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {D _ {\mathrm {L M}}}\right) + f _ {3} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {C \left[ \alpha_ {k} \right]}\right)\right)\right),
$$

$$
p _ {\theta} \left(A \left[ \alpha_ {i} \right]\rightarrow B \left[ \alpha_ {j} \right] D _ {\mathrm {L M}}\right) \quad \propto \exp \left(f _ {1} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {A \left[ \alpha_ {i} \right]}\right) ^ {\top} \left(f _ {2} \left(\mathbf {e} _ {B \left[ \alpha_ {j} \right]}\right) + f _ {3} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {D _ {\mathrm {L M}}}\right)\right)\right),
$$

$$
p _ {\theta} \left(D _ {\mathrm {L M}} \rightarrow w\right) = p _ {\mathrm {L M}} (w | \gamma).
$$

Both the QCFG and the language model can be trained end-to-end against the log marginal likelihood. While this modified model can embed flexible sequence models within a QCFG, it also inherits

many of their attendant issues (e.g. left-to-right generation). In preliminary attempts to incorporate sequence-to-sequence models into the QCFG we found that this combined model quickly degenerated into the uninteresting case of always using the autoregressive model, and hence did not pursue this further. However it is possible that modifications to the approach (e.g. separate pretraining of both models followed by joint finetuning, or using a pretrained monolingual language model that remains fixed) could lead to improvements.

# 3 Experiments

We apply the neural QCFG described above to a variety of sequence-to-sequence learning tasks. These experiments are not intended to push the state-of-the-art on these tasks but rather intended to assess whether our approach performs respectfully against standard baselines while simultaneously learning interesting and interpretable structures.

# 3.1 SCAN

We first experiment on SCAN [58], a diagnostic dataset where a model has to learn to translate simple English commands to actions (e.g. jump twice after walk  $\Rightarrow$  WALK JUMP JUMP). While conceptually simple, standard sequence-to-sequence models have been shown to fail on splits of the data designed to test for compositional generalization. We focus on four commonly-used splits: (1) simple, where train/test split is random, (2) add primitive (jump), where the primitive command jump is seen in isolation in training and must combine with other commands during testing, $^{9}$  (3) add template (around right), where the template around right is not seen during training, and (4) length, where the model is trained on action sequences of length at most 22 and tested on action sequences of length between 24 and 48. In these experiments, the nonterminals  $A \in \mathcal{N}$  are only combined with source nodes that govern at least two nodes, and the preterminals  $P \in \mathcal{P}$  are only combined with source terminals. We set  $|\mathcal{N}| = 10$  and  $|\mathcal{P}| = 1$ , and place two additional restrictions on the rule set. First, for rules of the form  $S \rightarrow A[\alpha_i]$  we restrict  $\alpha_{i}$  to always be the root of the source tree. Second, for rules of the form  $A[\alpha_i] \rightarrow B[\alpha_j]C[\alpha_k]$  we restrict  $\alpha_{j}, \alpha_{k}$  to be descendants of  $\alpha_{i}$ , or  $\alpha_{i}$  itself (i.e.  $\alpha_{j}, \alpha_{k} \in \operatorname{descendant}(\alpha_{i}) \cup \{\alpha_{i}\}$ ). These restrictions operationalize the constraint that the target tree hierarchy respects the source tree hierarchy, though still in a much looser sense than in an isomorphism. See appendix A.3.1 for the full experimental setup and hyperparameters.

Results Table 1 shows our results against various baselines on SCAN. While many approaches are able to solve this dataset almost perfectly, they often exploit SCAN-specific knowledge (e.g. that walk is an action word), which precludes their straightforward application to other domains. Among the domain-agnostic approaches that do not use SCAN-specific information, the neural QCFG performs respectfully, especially on the challenging length split of the data. Figure 1 shows an example generation from the test set of the add primitive (jump) split, where we observe that the model seems to have learned sensible transduction rules (e.g.  $N_{1}$  [run left twice] →  $N_{4}$  [run left]  $N_{4}$  [run left]). The node-level alignments further provide explicit provenance for each target span and makes the generation process more interpretable than standard attention mechanisms.

The source tree is linguistically incorrect but the model is still able to correctly transduce the output.

# 3.2 Style Transfer

We next apply our approach on style transfer on English utilizing the StylePTB dataset from Lyu et al. [63]. We focus on the three hard transfer tasks identified by the original authors: (1) active to passive (2808 examples), (2) adjective emphasis (696 examples), and (3) verb/action emphasis (1201 examples). The main difficulty with these tasks stems from the small training set combined with the relative complexity of these tasks. We set  $|\mathcal{N}| = |\mathcal{P}| = 8$  and use the same restrictions on the rule set as in the SCAN experiments. We also experiment with the phrase-to-phrase copy mechanism as described in section 2.4. The original paper provides several strong baselines: finetuned GPT2, a standard sequence-to-sequence model, and the retrieve-and-edit model from Hashimoto et al. [45]. We also train our own baseline sequence-to-sequence models with a (word-level) copy mechanism. See appendix A.3.2 for more details.

Results Table 2 shows the results, $^{10}$  where we observe that the neural QCFG performs well compared to the various baselines. We further find that incorporating the copy mechanism improves results substantially for both the baseline LSTM and the neural QCFG. $^{11}$  Figure 2 shows a test example from the active-to-passive task, which shows the word- and phrase-level copying mechanism in action. In this example the source tree is linguistically incorrect, but the grammar is nonetheless able to appropriately transduce the output. Given that linguistic phrases are generally more likely to remain unchanged in these types of tasks, biasing the model towards copying longer phrases (e.g. via posterior regularization) could potentially improve results. For example in figure 2 the ideal case would involve copying the phrase a 2-for-1 stock split, but this is not possible due to the incorrectly predicted source tree.

# 3.3 Machine Translation

Our final experiment is on a small-scale English-French machine translation dataset from Lake and Baroni [58]. Here we are interested in evaluating the model in two ways: first, as a standard machine translation system on a randomly held out test set, and second, to see if the model can systematically generalize to previously unseen combinations. To assess the latter, Lake and Baroni [58] add 1000 repetitions of i am daxy  $\Rightarrow$  je suis daxiste to the training set and test on 8 new sentences that use daxy in novel combinations (e.g. he is daxy  $\Rightarrow$  it est daxiste and i am not daxy  $\Rightarrow$  je ne sui pas daxiste). We use 9000 examples for training (1000 of which is the i am daxy example) and 1000 examples each for validation/test.

For these experiments, we set  $|\mathcal{N}| = |\mathcal{P}| = 6$  and combine all source models with all nonterminals/preterminals. We place two restrictions on the rule set: for rules of the form  $S \to A[\alpha_i]$  we restrict  $\alpha_{i}$  to be the root of the source tree (as in the previous experiments), and for rules of the form  $A[\alpha_i] \to B[\alpha_j]C[\alpha_k]$  we restrict  $\alpha_{j},\alpha_{k}$  to be the direct children of  $\alpha_{i}$ , or  $\alpha_{i}$  itself if  $\alpha_{i}$  has no children.12 See appendix A.3.3 for the full experimental setup and hyperparameters.

Results Table 3 shows the BLEU on the test set of 1000 examples, as well as the accuracy on the 8 daxy sentences. Compared to the baseline LSTM attention model, the neural QCFG performs well on the regular test set (as measured by BLEU) as well as the daxy test set. CGPS [60], which learns separate representations for generating attention distributions vs. the output, performs particularly well on the daxy test set,

but not as well on the regular test set. Figure 3 shows several examples of target tree derivations. As in the style transfer experiments, the source trees here would not be considered conventionally correct (the period is typically attached to the root), but the QCFG model is still able to correctly transduce the output by also learning unconventional trees on the target side as well.

# 4 Discussion

Neural quasi-synchronous grammars provide a general-purpose framework for many sequence-to-sequence learning tasks. On the positive side, our work can potentially pave the path towards more interpretable neural generative models that can provide explanations for their decisions via explicit node alignments and derivation rules. Further, by exposing the model's internals through the use of latent nonterminals, it also may be possible to achieve some level of control via manipulation of these variables. Such control mechanisms could, for example, be used to mitigate pronouns biases of that often exist in current neural generation systems.

However, several limitations remain. For one, the  $O(S^3 T^3)$  dynamic program will likely pose challenges in scaling this approach to larger datasets with longer sequences. The conditional independence assumptions made by the grammar also may not be appropriate for some tasks that involve complex dependencies. Finally, QCFGs may not be the most appropriate tool for domains in which the input/output is not naturally represented with tree structures, although it may be possible to extend these formalisms to consider (for example) graph-structured data.

# 5 Related Work

Synchronous grammars Synchronous grammars and tree transducers have a long and rich history in natural language processing [2, 84, 100, 65, 29, 25, 69, 48, 97, 37, 10, 19, inter alia]. In this work we focus on the formalism of quasi-synchronous grammars, which relaxes the assumption that the source and target tree be isomorphic. Quasi-synchronous grammars have enjoyed applications across many domains including in machine translation [86, 34, 35], question answering [94], paraphrase detection [20], sentence simplification [99, 98], and parser projection [87]. Prior work on quasi-synchronous grammars generally relied on pipelined parse trees for the source and only marginalized out the target tree, in contrast to the present work which treats both source and target trees as latent.

Compositional sequence-to-sequence learning Lake and Baroni [58] proposed the influential SCAN dataset for assessing the compositional generalization capabilities of neural sequence-to-sequence models. There has since been a large body of work on compositional sequence-to-sequence learning through various approaches including architectural modifications [60, 78, 36], grammars and neuro-symbolic models [71, 82, 70, 15, 61], meta-learning [57], and data augmentation [5, 41, 42, 3].

Deep latent variable models There has much recent work on neural parameterizations of classic probabilistic latent variable models including hidden Markov models [92, 95, 17], topic models [67, 23, 24], dependency models [50, 43, 12, 44, 104], and context-free grammars [55, 52, 111, 110, 105]. These works essentially extend feature-based unsupervised learning [9] to the neural case with the use of neural networks over embedding parameterizations, which makes it possible to easily condition the generative model on side information such as auxiliary latent variables [44, 55], images [109, 51, 47], videos [108], and source-side context [95, 83]. Since we marginalize over unobserved trees during learning, our work is also related to the line of work on marginalizing out latent variables/structures for sequence transduction tasks [38, 26, 75, 56, 107, 74, 101, 21, 59, 91].

# 6 Conclusion

In this paper we have studied sequence-to-sequence learning with latent neural grammars. We have shown that the formalism quasi-synchronous grammars provides a powerful tool with which to imbue inductive biases, operationalize domain-specific constraints, and interface with the model. Our approach performs favorably against standard baselines when applied to a variety of sequence-to-sequence learning tasks.

Future work in this area will consider: (1) revisiting richer grammatical formalisms (e.g. synchronous tree-adjoining grammars) with contemporary techniques parameterization and inference, (2) combining such structured models with pretrained language models, and (3) applying these methods to other structured domains such as programs and graphs. More generally, incorporating grammatical formalisms and symbolic systems into neural networks remains an exciting avenue for much future work.
