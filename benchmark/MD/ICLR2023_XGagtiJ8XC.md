# ABSTRACT

A protein can focus on different structure levels to implement its functions. Each structure has its own merit and driving forces in describing some specific characteristics, and they cannot replace each other. Most existing function prediction methods take the tertiary structure as input, unintentionally ignoring the other levels of protein structures. Considering protein sequences can determine multi-level structures, in this paper, we aim to realize the comprehensive potential of protein sequences for function prediction. Specifically, we propose a new prompt-guided multi-task pre-training and fine-tuning framework. Through the prompt-guided multi-task pre-training, we learn multiple prompt signals to steer the model, called PromptProtein, to focus on different levels of structure. We also design a prompt fine-tuning module to provide downstream tasks the on-demand flexibility of utilizing respective levels of structural information. Extensive experiments on function prediction and protein engineering show that PromptProtein outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Pre-trained language models (PTLMs) have prevailed in natural language processing (NLP). Recently, some methods (Alley et al., 2019; Elnaggar et al., 2021; Rives et al., 2021) are developed to use PTLMs to encode protein sequences to predict biological functions, which are called pretrained protein models (PTPMs). In contrast to natural languages, there are four distinct levels of protein structures (Kessel & Ben-Tal, 2018). The primal is the protein sequence consisting of amino acids, the second refers to the local folded structures (e.g.,  $\alpha$  helix and  $\beta$  pleated sheet), the tertiary describes the natural folded three-dimensional structure, and the quaternary is a protein multimer comprising multiple polypeptides. A protein can focus on different structure levels to implement its specific functions, including reserving a piece of the sequence, manifesting the whole 3D structure as conformational elements, or even cooperating with other proteins. Therefore, when predicting protein functions, it is vital to flexibly utilize multi-level structural information.

AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al., 2021) makes great progress in the tertiary structure prediction based on protein sequences. However, directly learning from predicted structures can be unachievable as the prediction of proteins without homologous sequences is inaccurate. More importantly, the quaternary structure of protein multimers which faithfully depicts protein functions is usually different from the tertiary (see Figure 1) and reliable predictive models have not been released. Fortunately, protein sequences are easy to obtain and can determine all the other levels of structures. This paper aims to realize the full potential of protein sequences in function prediction by prompting a PTPM to exploit all types of protein structures during pre-training. The main challenges are two-fold: 1) how to design proper pre-training tasks for different protein structures? and 2) how to efficiently integrate these tasks in the pre-training phase and transfer the implicit protein structure knowledge for function prediction in fine-tuning phase.

Figure 1: A comparison of protein CDK1 in the tertiary (left) and quaternary (right) structures.

For the first challenge, we design three complementary pre-training tasks across multiple structure levels, targeting both fine and coarse resolutions. Specifically, we use the de facto mask language modeling (MLM) task to exploit the primary structure information, where the model needs to predict randomly masked amino acids in a protein. For the secondary and tertiary structure, we propose the alpha-carbon coordinate prediction (CRD) task, where the model should output the relative positions between residues. For the quaternary structure, we propose the protein-protein interaction prediction (PPI) task, where the model is required to estimate the interaction probability. We collect millions of data covering different levels of protein structures from UniRef50 (uni, 2021), Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000), and STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019).

For the second challenge, a straightforward strategy is to leverage multi-task learning to combine the losses of different pre-training tasks. However, many works (Wu et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020) find that task interference is common when tasks are diverse. This problem can be more severe in multi-task pre-training due to the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks, causing negative knowledge transfer. For example, BERT (Kenton & Toutanova, 2019) leverages MLM and next sentence prediction (NSP) to learn the sequential dependency and sentence relationship simultaneously, while RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) finds the performance will be slightly improved when removing the NSP loss. We postulate this problem also exists in multi-level protein structures, as different structures can be inconsonant. The MLM task emphasizes the neighboring relationship along the sequence, while the CRD task shall focus more on long-range amino acid pairs which are spatially close in the tertiary structure.

To meet this challenge, inspired by recent prompt learning, we propose a prompt-guided multi-task pre-training and fine-tuning framework, and the resulting protein model is called PromptProtein. The prompt-guided multi-task pre-training associates multiple pre-training tasks with dedicated sentinel tokens, called prompts. To utilize the prompt tokens, we introduce a prompt-aware attention module, which modifies two components of the Transformer architecture: 1) Attention mask, which is designed to block attention calculation from input data to a prompt as a prompt should be task-dependent instead of sample-dependent. 2) For skip connection, a prompt is used to calculate a skip weight, which can filter out task-irrelevant information. At the fine-tuning phase, we propose a prompt fine-tuning module to coordinate all prompt tokens, such that the model is capable of leveraging multi-level protein structure information flexibly, enabling the positive transfer of learned structural knowledge to downstream tasks.

We conduct experiments on protein function and engineering tasks, where PromptProtein significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across all datasets, especially on low-resource protein engineering tasks where PromptProtein achieves an average improvement of  $17.0\%$ .

# 2 RELATED WORKS

Protein Representation Models. Proteins have complex structures that determine their biological functions (Epstein et al., 1963). A growing body of work focuses on how to leverage structural information to obtain protein representations and predict functions. Since evolution through natural selection has spoken protein sequences as their "natural language", various natural language processing methods are extended to proteins. Asgari & Mofrad (2015); Yang et al. (2018) apply word embedding algorithms (Mikolov et al., 2013) to obtain protein representations. Dalkiran et al. (2018); Öztürk et al. (2018) use one-dimensional convolutional neural networks to predict the functions. Furthermore, Alley et al. (2019); Elnaggar et al. (2021); Rives et al. (2021) explore whether the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, the transformer architectures, and the objective functions can effectively transfer from natural languages to proteins. To utilize the tertiary structure, Hermosilla et al. (2020); Somnath et al. (2021); Ganea et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2022) build protein graphs and employ message passing neural networks to produce structure-aware representations. Bepler & Berger (2021) employ contact map prediction and structural similarity prediction to pre-train the protein model. Although primary and tertiary structures have been studied, few works try to enrich protein representation with the quaternary structure which faithfully depicts protein functions. In this paper, we show that systematic modeling and flexible utilizing of multi-level structures are the key to improving the performance of function prediction and protein engineering.

Multi-task Learning. The goal of multi-task learning is to take advantage of inductive transfer across tasks and achieve better generalization performance. When tasks are diverse, using a naive

Figure 2: The architecture overview of PromptProtein. In the pre-training stage, we pre-train our model with three structure-related tasks, including mask language modeling, alpha-carbon prediction, and protein-protein interaction prediction. For each task, the model takes the protein sequence and the task-specific token as input and learns to produce a representation encoding the corresponding structure information. In the fine-tuning stage, a prompt-tuning module  $\tau_{\theta}(\cdot)$  can flexibly combine structure information via the learned prompt tokens for diverse downstream tasks.

shared MTL model can suffer from task interference. Prior methods have been proposed to deconflict gradients from different tasks. Chen et al. (2018) dynamically adjust gradient magnitudes so different tasks can be trained at similar scales. Yu et al. (2020) take the gradient direction into account and drop the projection of one task gradient direction onto another if they are conflicting. Rather than clipping the conflict gradient direction, Javaloy & Valera (2021) learn a rotation matrix for each task to bring different optima closer to each other. However, these methods are not designed for multi-task pre-training and cannot properly deal with the knowledge transferability to downstream tasks. We provide a schematic comparison of these methods in Appendix A.1.

Prompts for Pre-trained Models. In-context learning (Brown et al., 2020) is introduced to steer the pre-trained model to produce task-desired representations. In the NLP area, the prevailing approaches to designing prompts can be divided into two categories: discrete prompt designing and continuous prompt tuning. The discrete prompt technique (Schick & Schütze, 2021) adds task description tokens from a vocabulary to the context to obtain enriched sentence embeddings. However, the hand-crafted prompts may provide disturbance of human bias and are limited to discrete vocabulary spaces. In contrast, Li & Liang (2021); Zhang et al. (2021) generate optimal prompt vectors in continuous spaces. Inspired by these works, we extend the concept of prompt tuning to the pre-training stage, associate multi-level protein structural information with dedicated prompt tokens during pre-training, and adaptively combine these learned prompts for downstream tasks.

# 3 METHODOLOGY

To acquire multiple information from the input data  $\mathbf{x}$ , conventional multi-task learning usually produces a universal representation  $\mathbf{h}$ . The whole objective can be formulated as a weighted sum of individual task objectives:  $\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i} \alpha_{i} \mathcal{L}_{i}(\mathbf{h})$ , where  $\{\alpha_{i}\}$  are the hyper-parameters to balance these losses. However, multi-level protein structures can be inconstant: the primary structure focuses more on the dependency along the sequence, whereas the tertiary and quaternary structure weights more on the spatial organization, which can cause the problem of task interference. This problem can lead to more severe negative transfer in multi-task pre-training due to the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks. To solve this problem, we propose a prompt-guided multi-task pre-training and fine-tuning framework that utilizes a prompt token  $\mathbf{p}$  to produce a task-specific representation  $h_{\mathbf{p}}$ . Multiple learned tokens can be flexibly combined to steer the pre-trained model for various downstream tasks, bridging the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks.

This section first describes how to use prompts to modify the Transformer architecture, such that different tasks can be processed by different neural layers and reduce task interference. Then we present the three pre-training tasks to acquire multi-level protein structural information: (1) masked language modeling, (2) alpha-carbon coordinate prediction, and (3) protein-protein interaction prediction. Finally, we introduce the prompt-guided pre-training and fine-tuning framework where multiple information can be acquired in the pre-training stage and combined on-demand for downstream tasks. The resulting PromptProtein model is illustrated in Figure 2.

# 3.1 PROMPT-AWARE ATTENTION MODULE

To reduce interference between pre-training tasks, we use the prompt token to modify the Transformer architecture so that multiple information can be effectively acquired by the pre-trained model. Specifically, we modify two parts of the Transformer: attention mask and skip connection, and the resulting architecture is called Prompt-aware Transformer. Given an input protein sequence  $\pmb{x}$  and a prompt token  $\pmb{p}$ , we define the whole input  $\pmb{x}_{\pmb{p}}$  denote  $x_{p} = x||p$ , where  $||$  is concatenation. Let  $x_{p}^{i}$  be the  $i$ -th token of the whole input and  $h_p^{(l)}$  be the representation of  $x_{p}$  at the  $l$ -th layer.

Attention mask. The conventional self-attention is formulated as:  $\mathrm{Attn}(h_p^{(l)}) =$  Softmax((QKT)/√d)V, where Q, K, and V are the linear projection of  $h_p^{(l)}$ . Each token in the whole sequence can attend to others at any position which means the condition prompt will be affected by the input sequence. A more reasonable way is to keep only the effect of the prompt on the input sequence and eliminate the reverse effect, as a prompt should be task-dependent instead of sample-dependent. As illustrated in Figure 3, we design an attention mask matrix  $M$  to fulfill this requirement. Let  $M_{ij}$  denote the  $(i,j)$ -element of the mask matrix, and we define:

$$
M _ {i j} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l} 0, \boldsymbol {x} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {i} \in \boldsymbol {p} \text {a n d} \boldsymbol {x} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {j} \in \boldsymbol {x} \\ 1, \text {o t h e r s .} \end{array} \right. \tag {1}
$$

Skip connection. Skip connection enables deep neural networks easier to train (He et al., 2016). To encourage different tasks to be processed by different layers and reduce task interference, we design a weighted skip connection. That is, the prompt token is used to calculate a weight for the output of the attention module. The whole process can be:

Figure 3: Prompt-aware Attention Module. A pink circle represents an amino acid token and a purple circle represents a prompt token. We decouple prompt tokens from amino acid tokens by the attention mask. The embedding of decoupled prompt token determines the weight of the residual connection. In the fine-tuning stage, we use a prompt-tuning module  $\tau_{\theta}(\cdot)$  to learn the downstream task-desired composed prompt.

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {(l + 1)} = \boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {(l)} + (1 - g _ {\boldsymbol {p}}) \operatorname {A t t n} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {(l)}\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $g_{p}$  is linear projection of prompt  $p$ . After  $L$  layers of the prompt-aware attention module, we have the task-specific representation  $h_{p} = h_{p}^{(L)}$ .

# 3.2 PROTEIN MULTI-LEVEL STRUCTURES LEARNING

To acquire multi-level protein structure information, we consider three complementary pre-training tasks: (1) masked language modeling, which has been commonly used by existing PTPMs and can capture the primary structure information; (2) coordinate prediction, which acquires the secondary and tertiary structure; and (3) interaction prediction, which acquires the quaternary structure.

Masked language modeling. This task uses all available amino acid tokens to recover the masked ones. Let  $Y$  be the set of masked out tokens, and  $\mathcal{V}$  be the vocabulary of amino acid tokens. The MLM loss is formulated:

$$
q (y | \boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}}) = \frac {\exp (p (y | \boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}}))}{\sum_ {v \in \mathcal {V}} \exp (p (v | \boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}}))}, \quad \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {M L M}} (\boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}}) = \sum_ {y \in Y} - \log q (y | \boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}}). \tag {3}
$$

Alpha-Carbon Coordinate Prediction. Since the secondary structure can be inferred from the protein 3D coordinates (Kabsch & Sander, 1983), we use an alpha-carbons coordinate prediction task to learn both secondary and tertiary structures. Given the sequence length  $|\pmb{x}|$ , we denote the ground-truth naturally folded 3D structure of protein as  $Z \in \mathbb{R}^{|x| \times 3}$  and the structure predictor as  $\kappa$ , then the predicted structure is  $\kappa(h_{p}) \in \mathbb{R}^{|x| \times 3}$ . By translating and rotating (Kabsch, 1976) the

predicted structure, we can first get the minimal root mean square deviation between ground-truth and predicted structure, and the loss is calculated based on this deviation. In this way, there is no need to consider spatial invariance or equivalence, but only need to focus on the relative positions between the residues. The CRD loss can be calculated as the mean square error (MSE):

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {C R D}} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}}\right) = \operatorname {M S E} (Z, \operatorname {K a b s h} (\kappa \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}}\right))). \tag {4}
$$

Protein-Protein Interaction prediction. To acquire the quaternary structure information, we conduct the third pre-training task: predicting whether the  $m$ -th and  $n$ -th proteins can interact with each other within batched data. Let  $h_{p}^{m}$  be the  $m$ -th protein in a mini-batch and  $y_{m,n}$  is the ground-truth. We first calculate pair-aware protein representation  $h_{p}^{m,n}$ , then formulate the PPI loss:

$$
\operatorname {A t t n} _ {m, n} = \operatorname {S i g m o i d} (\frac {\left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {m} W\right) \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {n} W\right) ^ {T}}{\sqrt {d}}),
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {m, n} = \mathrm {m e a n} (\mathrm {A t t n} _ {m, n} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {m}) | | \mathrm {m e a n} (\mathrm {A t t n} _ {m, n} \boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {n}),
$$

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {P P I}} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}}\right) = \sum_ {m, n \in N} \operatorname {B C E} \left(y _ {m, n}, p \left(y _ {m, n}\right) \mid \boldsymbol {h} _ {\boldsymbol {p}} ^ {m, n}\right), \tag {5}
$$

where  $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d_W \times d_W}$  is a projection matrix, BCE is the binary cross-entropy loss function,  $N$  is the batch size. More details of the pre-training tasks are provided in Appendix A.2.

# 3.3 PROMPT-GUIDED MULTI-TASK PRE-TRAINING AND FINE-TUNING

Corresponding to the three pre-training tasks, the prompt can be instantiated as one of the three tokens, i.e.,  $\pmb{p} \in P = \{[\mathsf{MLM}], [\mathsf{CRD}], [\mathsf{PPI}]\}$ . The task-specific representation is thus denoted as  $h_{[\mathsf{MLM}]}, h_{[\mathsf{CRD}]}, h_{[\mathsf{PPI}]}$ . The objective function of the prompt-guided multi-task pre-training can be formulated as:

$$
\mathcal {L} = \alpha_ {1} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {M L M}} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {[ \mathrm {M L M} ]}\right) + \alpha_ {2} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {C R D}} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {[ \mathrm {C R D} ]}\right) + \alpha_ {3} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {P P I}} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {[ \mathrm {P P I} ]}\right). \tag {6}
$$

When we pre-train a model with multiple tasks as Equation 6, both model parameters  $\psi$  and prompts  $\pmb{p}$  are optimized. In this way, the model does not necessarily need to learn the optimal representation for all tasks, but only needs to learn the respective optimal representation for each task. Hence, the problem of task interference can be alleviated.

Furthermore, to bridge the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks, since the model can acquire each type of information conditioned on the learned prompt tokens, we can combine these tokens with prompt-tuning to flexibly mix the acquired information on-demand. We denote a prompt-tuning module as  $\tau_{\theta}(\cdot)$ , and the downstream task-desired protein representation  $h_{p'}$  can be obtained by feeding the tuned prompt  $p'$

$$
\boldsymbol {p} ^ {\prime} = \tau_ {\theta} \left(\boldsymbol {p} _ {[ \mathrm {M L M} ]}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {[ \mathrm {C R D} ]}, \boldsymbol {p} _ {[ \mathrm {P P I} ]}\right). \tag {7}
$$

Then the pre-trained model can produce  $h_{p'}$  and conduct predictions for the downstream task of interest. Equation 7 shows how to flexibly utilize the pre-training task information at the fine-tuning stage. Note that, in the pre-training stage, we only append one prompt to acquire one type of task-specific information, while in the fine-tuning stage, we feed all the learned prompt tokens to  $\tau_{\theta}(\cdot)$  and flexibly combine the acquired information. For sake of understanding, we provide the pseudocode of the prompt-guided multi-task pre-training and fine-tuning framework in Appendix A.3.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

# 4.1 PRE-TRAINING SETUP

For the primary structural information, we use UniRef50 (Suzek et al., 2015) which is a clustering of UniRef90 seed sequences at  $50\%$  sequence identity. For the secondary and tertiary structural information, we use Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000), which includes 200,000 protein 3D structures obtained by experimental methods. For the quaternary structure information, we use the STRING dataset (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) that contains amino acid sequences and protein-protein interaction pairs. In the STRING dataset, protein interactions are divided into 7 categories. We selected the physical-only interaction subset from STRING which contains 65 million protein sequences from 14,095 species and 2.7 billion protein-protein interaction pairs.

We implement PromptProtein using Pytorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and Fairseq (Ott et al., 2019). PromptProtein has 650M parameters with 33 layers and 20 attention heads. The embedding size is 1280. The learning rate is  $1 \times 10^{-4}$  with no weight decay. We use an inverse square root learning rate schedule. All models are trained on  $2 \times \mathrm{A}100$  40G GPUs for 270k steps of updates. After pre-training, the average error of the coordinate prediction task on a single residue is  $5\AA$ , and the accuracy of physical binding prediction is greater than  $90.0\%$ . Unless otherwise specified, we use this model in all downstream experiments. The source code will be available online. Please refer to Appendix B for the details of all the pre-training and downstream task dataset statistics.

# 4.2 DOWNSTREAM TASKS: FUNCTION ANNOTATION

Datasets and Metrics. Gene ontology (GO) terms and enzyme commission (EC) numbers are two standard classification schemes that organize myriad protein functions. Go terms organize the functions into three ontologies (Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC)) to describe different aspects of protein functions. EC numbers are assigned based on the chemical reactions that protein catalyzes. These function prediction tasks can be regarded as multiple binary classification tasks. We follow the dataset split method in (Gligorijevic et al., 2021). The evaluation metrics are protein-centric maximum F-score  $(F_{\mathrm{max}})$  and term-centric area under precision-recall (AUPR) curve, which are used in the CAFA challenges (Radivojac et al., 2013).

Baselines. There are four categories of baselines. (1) Sequence-based encoders. CNN (Shanehsaz-zadeh et al., 2020), ResNet, LSTM, and Transformer (Rao et al., 2019) only take amino acid sequence as input; (2) Geometric learning method. GAT (Veličković et al., 2018), GVP (Jing et al., 2020), DeepFRI (Gligorijević et al., 2021), and GearNet-Edge (pre-trained by Multiview Contrast) (Zhang et al., 2022) take protein 3D coordinates as additional input to obtain informative representation; (3) Pre-trained protein models. ESM-1b (Rives et al., 2021), ProtBERT-BFD (El-naggar et al., 2021), and LM-GVP (Wang et al., 2022) learn the pattern from large protein corpus. MT-LSTM (Bepler & Berger, 2021) uses contact map and structure similarity to enrich the embeddings. (4) Multi-task learning framework. We employ naive multi-task learning (MTL) and two optimization methods (GradNorm (Chen et al., 2018), RotoGram (Javaloy & Valera, 2021)).

Results. We present the evaluation results of proposed PromptProtein and state-of-the-art baselines in Table 1. Compared with all baselines, PromptProtein achieves new state-of-the-art performance on all tasks, which indicates that systematic modeling of multi-level structure information is beneficial. Although the multi-task learning baselines integrate the same information as PromptProtein, they cannot learn multiple information well and transfer properly to downstream tasks. Their inferior performance in GO-BP and GO-CC suggests that there is a gap between downstream task-desired representations and universal pre-trained representations. Flexible composing of structural information significantly improves the performance of the model for downstream tasks.

# 4.3 DOWNSSTREAM TASKS: PROTEIN ENGINEERING TASKS

# Datasets and Metrics.

Protein engineering is regarded as a sequence regression task that, given a protein, models are required to identify the functional strength, often termed the fitness landscape. Here, we employ five datasets (stability, fluorescence, thermostability, AAV, and GB1) coming from TAPE (Rao et al., 2019) and FILP (Dallago et al., 2021) to evaluate whether the model can produce accurate quantitative predictions of these functions. We report the commonly-used Spearman's  $\rho$  (rank correlation coefficient) to measure the degree to which the landscape was learned.

Baselines. For proteins without 3D structures, geometric methods cannot directly apply to these tasks. We choose sequence-based methods (CNN, LSTM, Transformer) and pre-trained protein methods (ESM-1b, ESM-1v (Meier et al., 2021), ProteinBert-BFD, LSTM-MT) as baselines for protein engineering tasks. As Dallago et al. (2021) purport that the various pooling choices perform inconsistently across datasets and splits, for a fair comparison, we utilize the mean pooling method to obtain protein representation.

Results. From Table 2, we observe that PromptProtein obtains better performance than all baselines. It confirms that pre-training on structural objectives contributes to protein engineering tasks and systematic modeling of protein multi-level structure leads to further improvements. Note that LSTM, which leverages the tertiary structural information to enhance protein representations, cannot surpass ESM-1b on all datasets, while our proposed approach obtains superior performances. This observation demonstrates that not all structural information leads to positive transfer and flexible utilization of structural information is the key to improved performance. Moreover, PromptProtein can obtain  $17.0\%$  improvement on average in low-resource settings of the AAV and GB1 datasets, compared to the well-performed PTPM baselines. These results indicate that the prompt-guiding PTPM is a better few-shot learner.

# 4.4 ABLATION STUDY

The ablation study is conducted to validate the effectiveness of designed modules in PromptProtein, i.e., prompts, attention mask, or skip connection. As illustrated in Table 3, the performance will decay if any one of the modules is absent, demonstrating that all the modules are advantageous. Furthermore, we notice that skip connection contributes most to the performance, confirming the necessity of reducing task interference.

# 4.5 ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

How do prompts determine the processing pathways of structural information?

Without Prompt-Guided Embedding  
(c)

In Figure 4(a), we visualize the skip weights of three pre-trained prompts at different neural layers, and compute the Pearson's correlation (Benesty et al., 2009) of these skip weights to measure the mutual correlations between the pre-training tasks (Figure 4(b)). We have the following key observations. (a) The skip weights are similar in the bottom layers (1-13) across all prompts, indicating all three tasks are processed by these layers. The MLM task information is mainly acquired by the middle layers (14-29), whereas the CRD and PPI information is more acquired by the top layers (30-33). (b) We clearly observe that the [CRD] and [PPI] prompts are more correlated. This is consistent with the intuition that the tertiary and quaternary levels are 3D structures whose amino acids attend to spatially adjacent neighbors, resulting in similar skip weight patterns. Further analysis of the model layer can be found in Appendix B.3.

# Can PromptProtein learn multi-level structures?

To examine whether prompt-guided pre-training can learn multiple structure information, we conduct experiments to visualize the protein representations conditioned on different pre-trained prompt tokens. We use t-SNE (van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) to reduce the dimension of embeddings. Figure 5(a) illustrates amino acid embeddings conditioned on [MLM]. We observe that amino acid embeddings in a protein are grouped according to their type. Figure 5(b) illustrates amino acid embeddings conditioned on [CRD]. We find that amino acids are linearly arranged in 2D space along their sequence in the protein. To obtain a more accurate relationship between representations and structures, we compare the protein contact map and the coordinate of embedding. The strong correlation between them demonstrates the CRD objective can effectively learn information about protein 3D structures. In Figure 5(c), we visualize the amino acid embeddings with traditional multi-task pre-training and highlight serine (a class of amino acids). The embeddings attempt to merge multiple structural features at the same time, which leads to an unclear pattern. These results show that

Right: Visualize the amino acids with the most variation embeddings (red).

prompt-guided pre-training mitigates task interference and allows the multiple structure information to be learned well, resulting in promising performance.

Furthermore, since the [PPI] prompt is trained to provide quaternary structure information, we analyze what exactly the amino acid representations have changed. As shown in Figure 7(a), we firstly visualize the embeddings of amino acids of the TAF4 protein conditioned on [MLM] or [PPI] based on MDS (Kruskal, 1964). Then we calculate the distances between two embeddings of the same amino acid and plot them in Figure 7(b). We mark 30 amino acids with the most variation embeddings in red (Figure 7(c)). The observation that marked amino acids are all on the protein surface is consistent with the fact that modeling the quaternary structure cares about the surface conformation, not the core (Yan et al., 2008).

# Do downstream tasks benefit from the acquired information on-demand by prompt tuning?

To further analyze the importance of prompt-guided fine-tuning, we conduct an ablation study on the binding affinity prediction task on the SAbDab dataset (Dunbar et al., 2014). From Figure 6, we observe that PromptProtein performs worst without any prompt tokens. In contrast, adding either of the three prompt tokens, especially the token corresponding to the PPI task, can significantly improve performance. By combining different prompts without prompt tuning, we can obtain protein representations enhanced by multiple structural information. By doing that, we find the combination of the [MLM] and [PPI] prompts empowers PromptProtein to achieve the best performance.

It is also notable that, by comparing the results of adding [MLM] and [PPI] prompts and adding all prompts, the [CRD] prompt leads to a performance decrease. These results evidence that not all structure information from pre-training is beneficial for downstream tasks, and adaptively combining acquired information via prompt-tuning leads to better performance.

# 5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we extend the concept of prompts from NLP to protein representations. We propose the prompt-guided multi-task pre-training and fine-tuning framework. With this framework, we propose three complementary pre-training structures to acquire multi-level structure information, and flexibly combine them for various downstream tasks. Experimental results on function prediction and protein engineering show that PromptProtein beats state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins. The improvement is especially significant in low-resource settings. In the future, we are interested in examining the effectiveness of the proposed prompt-guided multi-task pre-training and fine-tuning framework in domains where hierarchical task information is required in the pre-training stage.
