# ABSTRACT

Background: Statistical mechanics results (Dauphin et al. (2014); Choromanska et al. (2015)) suggest that local minima with high error are exponentially rare in high dimensions. However, to prove low error guarantees for Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs), previous works so far required either a heavily modified MNN model or training method, strong assumptions on the labels (e.g., "near" linear separability), or an unrealistically wide hidden layer with  $\Omega(N)$  units.

Results: We examine a MNN with one hidden layer of piecewise linear units, a single output, and a quadratic loss. We prove that, with high probability in the limit of  $N \to \infty$  datapoints, the volume of differentiable regions of the empiric loss containing sub-optimal differentiable local minima is exponentially vanishing in comparison with the same volume of global minima, given standard normal input of dimension  $d_0 = \tilde{\Omega}\left(\sqrt{N}\right)$ , and a more realistic number of  $d_1 = \tilde{\Omega}\left(N / d_0\right)$  hidden units. We demonstrate our results numerically: for example, 0% binary classification training error on CIFAR with only  $N / d_0 \approx 16$  hidden neurons.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Motivation. Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs), trained with simple variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), have achieved state-of-the-art performances in many areas of machine learning (LeCun et al., 2015). However, theoretical explanations seem to lag far behind this empirical success (though many hardness results exist, e.g., (Sima, 2002; Shamir, 2016)). For example, as a common rule-of-the-thumb, a MNN should have at least as many parameters as training samples. However, it is unclear why such over-parameterized MNNs often exhibit remarkably small generalization error (i.e., difference between "training error" and "test error"), even without explicit regularization (Zhang et al., 2017a).

Moreover, it has long been a mystery why MNNs often achieve low training error (Dauphin et al., 2014). SGD is only guaranteed to converge to critical points in which the gradient of the expected loss is zero (Bottou, 1998), and, specifically, to local minima (Pemantle, 1990) (this is true also for regular gradient descent (Lee et al., 2016)). Since loss functions parameterized by MNN weights are non-convex, it is unclear why does SGD often work well – rather than converging to sub-optimal local minima with high training error, which are known to exist (Fukumizu & Amari, 2000; Swirszcz et al., 2016). Understanding this behavior is especially relevant in important cases where SGD does get stuck (He et al., 2016) – where training error may be a bottleneck in further improving performance.

Ideally, we would like to quantify the probability to converge to a local minimum as a function of the error at this minimum, where the probability is taken with the respect to the randomness of the initialization of the weights, the data and SGD. Specifically, we would like to know, under which conditions this probability is very small if the error is high, as was observed empirically (e.g., Dauphin et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015)). However, this seems to be a daunting task for realistic MNNs, since it requires a characterization of the sizes and distributions of the basins of attraction for all local minima.

Previous works (Dauphin et al., 2014; Choromanska et al., 2015), based on statistical physics analogies, suggested a simpler property of MNNs: that with high probability, local minima with high error diminish exponentially with the number of parameters. Though proving such a geometric property with realistic assumptions would not guarantee convergence to global minima, it appears to

be a necessary first step in this direction (see discussion on section 6). It was therefore pointed out as an open problem at the Conference of Learning Theory (COLT) 2015. However, one has to be careful and use realistic MMN architectures, or this problem becomes "too easy".

For example, one can easily achieve zero training error (Nilsson, 1965; Baum, 1988) – if the MNN's last hidden layer has more neurons than training samples. Such extremely wide MNNs are easy to optimize (Yu, 1992; Huang et al., 2006; Livni et al., 2014; Shen, 2016; Nguyen & Hein, 2017). In this case, the hidden layer becomes linearly separable in classification tasks, with high probability over the random initialization of the weights. Thus, by training the last layer we get to a global minimum (zero training error). However, such extremely wide layers are not very useful, since they result in a huge number of weights, and serious overfitting issues. Also, training only the last layer seems to take little advantage of the inherently non-linear nature of MNNs.

Therefore, in this paper we are interested to understand the properties of local and global minima, but at a more practical number of parameters – and when at least two weight layers are trained. For example, Alexnet (Krizhevsky, 2014) is trained using about 1.2 million ImageNet examples, and has about 60 million parameters – 16 million of these in the two last weight layers. Suppose we now train the last two weight layers in such an over-parameterized MNN. When do the sub-optimal local minima become exponentially rare in comparison to the global minima?

Main contributions. We focus on MNNs with a single hidden layer and piecewise linear units, optimized using the Mean Square Error (MSE) in a supervised binary classification task (Section 2). We define  $N$  as the number of training samples,  $d_{l}$  as the width of the  $l$ -th activation layer, and  $g(x) < h(x)$  as an asymptotic inequality in the leading order (formally:  $\lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{\log g(x)}{\log h(x)} < 1$ ). We examine Differentiable Local Minima (DLMs) of the MSE: sub-optimal DLMs where at least a fraction of  $\epsilon >0$  of the training samples are classified incorrectly, and global minima where all samples are classified correctly.

Our main result, Theorem 10, states that, with high probability, the total volume of the differentiable regions of the MSE containing sub-optimal DLMs is exponentially vanishing in comparison to the same volume of global minima, given that:

Assumption 1. The datapoints (MNN inputs) are sampled from a standard normal distribution.

Assumption 2.  $N\to \infty$ $d_0(N)$  and  $d_{1}(N)$  increase with  $N$  , while  $\epsilon \in (0,1)$  is a constant1.

Assumption 3. The input dimension scales as  $\sqrt{N} < d_0 \leq N$ .

Assumption 4. The hidden layer width scales as

$$
\frac {N \log^ {4} N}{d _ {0}} \dot {<  } d _ {1} \dot {<  } N. \tag {1.1}
$$

Importantly, we use a standard, unmodified, MNN model, and make no assumptions on the target function. Moreover, as the number of parameters in the MNN is approximately  $d_0d_1$ , we require only "asymptotically mild" over-parameterization:  $d_0d_1 > N\log^4 N$  from eq. (1.1). For example, if  $d_0 \propto N$ , we only require  $d_1 > \log^4 N$  neurons. This improves over previously known results (Yu, 1992; Huang et al., 2006; Livni et al., 2014; Shen, 2016; Nguyen & Hein, 2017) - which require an extremely wide hidden layer with  $d_1 \geq N$  neurons (and thus  $Nd_{0}$  parameters) to remove sub-optimal local minima with high probability.

In section 5 we validate our results numerically. We show that indeed the training error becomes low when the number of parameters is close to  $N$ . For example, with binary classification on CIFAR and ImageNet, with only 16 and 105 hidden neurons (about  $N / d_0$ ), respectively, we obtain less than  $0.1\%$  training error. Additionally, we find that convergence to non-differentiable critical points does not appear to be very common.

Lastly, in section 6 we discuss our results might be extended, such as how to apply them to "mildly" non-differentiable critical points.

Plausibility of assumptions. Assumption 1 is common in this type of analysis (Andoni et al., 2014; Choromanska et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2016; Tian, 2017; Brutzkus & Globerson, 2017). At first it may

appear rather unrealistic, especially since the inputs are correlated in typical datasets. However, this no-correlation part of the assumption may seem more justified if we recall that datasets are many times whitened before being used as inputs. Alternatively, if, as in our motivating question, we consider the input to the our simple MNN to be the output of the previous layers of a deep MNN with fixed random weights, this also tends to de-correlate inputs (Poole et al., 2016, Figure 3). The remaining part of assumption 1, that the distribution is normal, is indeed strong, but might be relaxed in the future, e.g. using central limit theorem type arguments.

In assumption 2 we use this asymptotic limit to simplify our proofs and final results. Multiplicative constants and finite (yet large)  $N$  results can be found by inspection of the proofs. We assume a constant error  $\epsilon$  since typically the limit  $\epsilon \to 0$  is avoided to prevent overfitting.

In assumption 3, for simplicity we have  $d_0 \dot{\leq} N$ , since in the case  $d_0 \geq N$  the input is generically linearly separable, and sub-optimal local minima are not a problem (Gori & Tesi, 1992; Safran & Shamir, 2016). Additionally, we have  $\sqrt{N} < d_0$ , which seems very reasonable, since for example,  $d_0 / N \approx 0.016$ , 0.061 and 0.055 MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet, respectively.

In assumption 4, for simplicity we have  $d_1 < N$ , since, as mentioned earlier, if  $d_1 \geq N$  the hidden layer is linearly separable with high probability, which removes sub-optimal local minima. The other bound  $N \log^4 N < d_0 d_1$  is our main innovation – a large over-parameterization which is nevertheless asymptotically mild and improves previous results.

Previous work. So far, general low (training or test) error guarantees for MNNs could not be found – unless the underlying model (MNN) or learning method (SGD or its variants) have been significantly modified. For example, (Dauphin et al., 2014) made an analogy with high-dimensional random Gaussian functions, local minima with high error are exponentially rare in high dimensions; (Choromanska et al., 2015; Kawaguchi, 2016) replaced the units (activation functions) with independent random variables; (Pennington & Bahri, 2017) replaces the weights and error residuals with independent random variables; (Baldi, 1989; Saxe et al., 2014; Hardt & Ma, 2017; Lu & Kawaguchi, 2017; Zhou & Feng, 2017) used linear units; (Zhang et al., 2017b) used unconventional units (e.g., polynomials) and very large hidden layers ( $d_{1} = \text{poly}(d_{0})$ , typically  $\gg N$ ); (Brutzkus & Globerson, 2017; Du et al., 2017; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2017) used a modified convnet model with less than  $d_{0}$  parameters (therefore, not a universal approximator (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik, 1991)); (Tian, 2017; Soltanolkotabi et al., 2017; Li & Yuan, 2017) assume the weights are initialized very close to those of the teacher generating the labels; and (Janzamin et al., 2015; Zhong et al., 2017) use a non-standard tensor method during training. Such approaches fall short of explaining the widespread success of standard MNN models and training practices.

Other works placed strong assumptions on the target functions. For example, to prove convergence of the training error near the global minimum, (Gori & Tesi, 1992) assumed linearly separable datasets, while (Safran & Shamir, 2016) assumed strong clustering of the targets ("near" linear-separability). Also, (Andoni et al., 2014) showed a  $p$ -degree polynomial is learnable by a MNN, if the hidden layer is very large ( $d_{1} = \Omega \left(d_{0}^{6p}\right)$ , typically  $\gg N$ ) so learning the last weight layer is sufficient. However, these are not the typical regimes in which MNNs are required or used. In contrast, we make no assumption on the target function. Other closely related results (Soudry & Carmon, 2016; Xie et al., 2016) also used unrealistic assumptions, are discussed in section 6, in regards to the details of our main results.

Therefore, in contrast to previous works, the assumptions in this paper are applicable in some situations (e.g., Gaussian input) where a MNN trained using SGD might be used and be useful (e.g., have a lower test error then a linear classifier).

# 2 PRELIMINARIES AND NOTATION

Model. We examine a Multilayer Neural Network (MNN) with a single hidden layer and a scalar output. The MNN is trained on a finite training set of  $N$  datapoints (features)  $\mathbf{X} \triangleq [\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}^{(N)}] \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0 \times N}$  with their target labels  $\mathbf{y} \triangleq [y^{(1)}, \ldots, y^{(N)}]^\top \in \{0, 1\}^N -$  each datapoint-label pair  $(\mathbf{x}^{(n)}, y^{(n)})$  is independently sampled from some joint distribution  $\mathbb{P}_{X,Y}$ . We

define  $\mathbf{W} = [\mathbf{w}_1, \dots, \mathbf{w}_{d_1}]^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_0}$  and  $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}$  as the first and second weight layers (bias terms are ignored for simplicity), respectively, and  $f(\cdot)$  as the common leaky rectifier linear unit (LReLU (Maas et al., 2013))

$$
f (u) \triangleq u a (u) \text {w i t h} a (u) \triangleq \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1 & , \text {i f}, u > 0 \\ \rho & , \text {i f} u <   0 \end{array} \right., \tag {2.1}
$$

for some  $\rho \neq 1$  (so the MNN is non-linear), where both functions  $f$  and  $a$  operate component-wise (e.g., for any matrix  $\mathbf{M}$ :  $(f(\mathbf{M}))_{ij} = f(M_{ij})$ ). Thus, the output of the MNN on the entire dataset can be written as

$$
f \left(\mathbf {W X}\right) ^ {\top} \mathbf {z} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {N}. \tag {2.2}
$$

We use the mean square error (MSE) loss for optimization

$$
\operatorname {M S E} \triangleq \frac {1}{N} \| \mathbf {e} \| ^ {2} \text {w i t h} \mathbf {e} \triangleq \mathbf {y} - f (\mathbf {W X}) ^ {\top} \mathbf {z}, \tag {2.3}
$$

where  $\|\cdot\|$  is the standard euclidean norm. Also, we measure the empiric performance as the fraction of samples that are classified correctly using a decision threshold at  $y = 0.5$ , and denote this as the mean classification error, or  $\mathrm{MCE}^2$ . Note that the variables  $\mathbf{e}$ , MSE, MCE and other related variables (e.g., their derivatives) all depend on  $\mathbf{W}$ ,  $\mathbf{z}$ ,  $\mathbf{X}$ ,  $\mathbf{y}$  and  $\rho$ , but we keep this dependency implicit, to avoid cumbersome notation.

Additional Notation. We define  $g(x) < h(x)$  if and only if  $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\log g(x)}{\log h(x)} < 1$  (and similarly  $\dot{\leq}$  and  $\dot{=}$ ). We denote "M ~  $\sim$  N" when M is a matrix with entries drawn independently from a standard normal distribution (i.e.,  $\forall i, j$ :  $M_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ ). The Khatari-rao product (cf. (Allman et al., 2009)) of two matrices,  $\mathbf{A} = [\mathbf{a}^{(1)}, \dots, \mathbf{a}^{(N)}] \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times N}$  and  $\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \dots, \mathbf{x}^{(N)}] \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0 \times N}$  is defined as

$$
\mathbf {A} \circ \mathbf {X} \triangleq \left[ \boldsymbol {a} ^ {(1)} \otimes \mathbf {x} ^ {(1)}, \dots , \boldsymbol {a} ^ {(N)} \otimes \mathbf {x} ^ {(N)} \right] \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {0} d _ {1} \times N}, \tag {2.4}
$$

where  $\mathbf{a} \otimes \mathbf{x} = [a_1\mathbf{x}^\top, \ldots, a_{d_1}\mathbf{x}^\top]^\top$  is the Kronecker product.

# 3 BASIC PROPERTIES OF DIFFERENTIABLE LOCAL MINIMA

MNNs are typically trained by minimizing the loss over the training set, using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), or one of its variants (e.g., Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015)). Under rather mild conditions (Pemantle, 1990; Bottou, 1998), SGD asymptotically converges to local minima of the loss. For simplicity, we focus on differentiable local minima (DLMs) of the MSE (eq. (2.3)). In section 4 we will show that sub-optimal DLMs are exponentially rare in comparison to global minima. Non-differentiable critical points, in which some neural input (pre-activation) is exactly zero, are shown to be numerically rare in section 5, and are left for future work, as discussed in section 6.

Before we can provide our results, in this section we formalize a few necessary notions. For example, one has to define how to measure the amount of DLMs in the over-parameterized regime: there is an infinite number of such points, but they typically occupy only a measure zero volume in the weight space. Fortunately, using the differentiable regions of the MSE (definition 1), the DLMs can partitioned to a finite number of equivalence groups, so all DLMs in each region have the same error (Lemma 2). Therefore, we use the volume of these regions (definition 3) as the relevant measure in our theorems.

Differentiable regions of the MSE. The MSE is a piecewise differentiable function of  $\mathbf{W}$ , with at most  $2^{d_1N}$  differentiable regions, defined as follows.

Definition 1. For any  $\mathbf{A} \in \{\rho, 1\}^{d_1 \times N}$  we define the corresponding differentiable region

$$
\mathcal {D} _ {\mathbf {A}} (\mathbf {X}) \triangleq \left\{\mathbf {W} \mid a (\mathbf {W X}) = \mathbf {A} \right\} \subset \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {1} \times d _ {0}}. \tag {3.1}
$$

Also, any DLM  $(\mathbf{W},\mathbf{z})$ , for which  $\mathbf{W}\in \mathcal{D}_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbf{X})$  is denoted as "in  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbf{X})$ ".

Note that  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbf{X})$  is an open set, since  $a(0)$  is undefined (from eq. 2.1). Clearly, for all  $\mathbf{W} \in \mathcal{D}_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbf{X})$  the MSE is differentiable, so any local minimum can be non-differentiable only if it is not in any differentiable region. Also, all DLMs in a differentiable region are equivalent, as we prove on appendix section 7:

Lemma 2. At all DLMs in  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbf{X})$  the residual error  $\mathbf{e}$  is identical, and furthermore

$$
(\mathbf {A} \circ \mathbf {X}) \mathbf {e} = 0. \tag {3.2}
$$

The proof is directly derived from the first order necessary condition of DLMs  $(\nabla \mathrm{MSE} = 0)$  and their stability. Note that Lemma 2 constrains the residual error  $\mathbf{e}$  in the over-parameterized regime:  $d_0 d_1 \geq N$ . In this case eq. (3.2) implies  $\mathbf{e} = 0$ , if  $\operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) = N$ . Therefore, we must have  $\operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) < N$  for sub-optimal DLMs to exist. Later, we use similar rank-based constraints to bound the volume of differentiable regions which contain DLMs with high error. Next, we define this volume formally.

Angular Volume. From its definition (eq. (3.1)) each region  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbf{X})$  has an infinite volume in  $\mathbb{R}^{d_1\times d_0}$ : if we multiply a row of  $\mathbf{W}$  by a positive scalar, we remain in the same region. Only by rotating the rows of  $\mathbf{W}$  can we move between regions. We measure this "angular volume" of a region in a probabilistic way: we randomly sample the rows of  $\mathbf{W}$  from an isotropic distribution, e.g., standard Gaussian:  $\mathbf{W}\sim \mathcal{N}$ , and measure the probability to fall in  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbf{X})$ , arriving to the following

Definition 3. For any region  $\mathcal{R} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_0}$ . The angular volume of  $\mathcal{R}$  is

$$
\mathcal {V} (\mathcal {R}) \triangleq \mathbb {P} _ {\mathbf {W} \sim \mathcal {N}} (\mathbf {W} \in \mathcal {R}). \tag {3.3}
$$

# 4 MAIN RESULTS

Some of the DLMs are global minima, in which  $\mathbf{e} = 0$  and so,  $\mathrm{MCE} = \mathrm{MSE} = 0$ , while other DLMs are sub-optimal local minima in which  $\mathrm{MCE} > \epsilon > 0$ . We would like to compare the angular volume (definition 3) corresponding to both types of DLMs. Thus, we make the following definitions.

Definition 4. We define  $\mathcal{L}_{\epsilon} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_0}$  as the union of differentiable regions containing sub-optimal DLMs with MCE  $> \epsilon$ , and  $\mathcal{G} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_0}$  as the union of differentiable regions containing global minima with MCE  $= 0$ .

Definition 5. We define the constant  $\gamma_{\epsilon}$  as  $\gamma_{\epsilon} \triangleq 0.23 \max \left[\lim_{N \to \infty} \left(d_0(N) / N\right), \epsilon\right]^{3/4}$  if  $\rho \neq \{0,1\}$ , and  $\gamma_{\epsilon} \triangleq 0.23 \epsilon^{3/4}$  if  $\rho = 0$ .

In this section, we use assumptions 1-4 (stated in section 1) to bound the angular volume of the region  $\mathcal{L}_{\epsilon}$  encapsulating all sub-optimal DLMs, the region  $\mathcal{G}$ , encapsulating all global minima, and the ratio between the two.

Angular volume of sub-optimal DLMs. First, in appendix section 8 we prove the following upper bound in expectation

Theorem 6. Given assumptions 1-4, the expected angular volume of sub-optimal DLMs, with  $\mathrm{MCE} > \epsilon >0$ , is exponentially vanishing in  $N$  as

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {\mathbf {X} \sim \mathcal {N}} \mathcal {V} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {\epsilon} (\mathbf {X}, \mathbf {y})\right) \dot {\leq} \exp \left(- \gamma_ {\epsilon} N ^ {3 / 4} \left[ d _ {1} d _ {0} \right] ^ {1 / 4}\right).
$$

and, using Markov inequality, its immediate probabilistic corollary

Corollary 7. Given assumptions 1-4, for any  $\delta >0$  (possibly a vanishing function of  $N$ ), we have, with probability  $1 - \delta$ , that the angular volume of sub-optimal DLMs, with  $\mathrm{MCE} > \epsilon >0$ , is exponentially vanishing in  $N$  as

$$
\mathcal {V} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {\epsilon} (\mathbf {X}, \mathbf {y})\right) \dot {\leq} \frac {1}{\delta} \exp \left(- \gamma_ {\epsilon} N ^ {3 / 4} \left[ d _ {1} d _ {0} \right] ^ {1 / 4}\right)
$$

Proof idea of Theorem 6: we first show that in differentiable regions with  $\mathrm{MCE} > \epsilon >0$ , the condition in Lemma 2,  $(\mathbf{A}\circ \mathbf{X})\mathbf{e} = 0$ , implies that  $\mathbf{A} = a$  (Wx) must have a low rank. Then, we show that, when  $\mathbf{X}\sim \mathcal{N}$  and  $\mathbf{W}\sim \mathcal{N}$ , the matrix  $\mathbf{A} = a$  (WX) has a low rank with exponentially low probability. Combining both facts, we obtain the bound.

Existence of global minima. Next, to compare the volume of sub-optimal DLMs with that of global minima, in appendix section 9 we show first that, generically, global minima do exist (using a variant of the proof of (Baum, 1988, Theorem 1)):

Theorem 8. For any  $\mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^N$  and  $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0 \times N}$  almost everywhere we find matrices  $\mathbf{W}^* \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1^* \times d_0}$  and  $\mathbf{z}^* \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1^*}$ , such that  $\mathbf{y} = f(\mathbf{W}^*\mathbf{X})^\top \mathbf{z}^*$ , where  $d_1^* \triangleq 4\lceil N / (2d_0 - 2)\rceil$  and  $\forall i, n: \mathbf{w}_i^\top \mathbf{x}^{(n)} \neq 0$ . Therefore, every MNN with  $d_1 \geq d_1^*$  has a DLM which achieves zero error  $\mathbf{e} = 0$ .

Recently (Zhang et al., 2017a, Theorem 1) similarly proved that a 2-layer MNN with approximately  $2N$  parameters can achieve zero error. However, that proof required  $N$  neurons (similarly to (Nilsson, 1965; Baum, 1988; Yu, 1992; Huang et al., 2006; Livni et al., 2014; Shen, 2016)), while Theorem 8 here requires much less: approximately  $d_1^* \approx 2N / d_0$ . Also, (Hardt & Ma, 2017, Theorem 3.2) showed a deep residual network with  $N \log N$  parameters can achieve zero error. In contrast, here we require just one hidden layer with  $2N$  parameters.

Note the construction in Theorem 8 here achieves zero training error by overfitting to the data realization, so it is not expected to be a "good" solution in terms of generalization. To get good generalization, one needs to add additional assumptions on the data (X and y). Such a possible (common yet insufficient for MNNs) assumption is that the problem is "realizable", i.e., there exist a small "solution MNN", which achieves low error. For example, in the zero error case:

Assumption 5. (Optional) The labels are generated by some teacher  $\mathbf{y} = f\left(\mathbf{W}^{*}\mathbf{X}\right)^{\top}\mathbf{z}^{*}$  with weight matrices  $\mathbf{W}^{*}\in \mathbb{R}^{d_{1}^{*}\times d_{0}}$  and  $\mathbf{z}^{*}\in \mathbb{R}^{d_{1}^{*}}$  independent of  $\mathbf{X}$ , for some  $d_1^*\dot{\prec} N / d_0$ .

This assumption is not required for our main result (Theorem 10) – it is merely helpful in improving the following lower bound on  $\mathcal{V}(\mathcal{G})$ .

Angular volume of global minima. We prove in appendix section 10:

Theorem 9. Given assumptions 1-3, we set  $\delta \doteq \sqrt{\frac{8}{\pi}} d_0^{-1/2} + 2d_0^{1/2}\sqrt{\log d_0}/N$  and  $d_1^* = 2N/d_0$ , or if assumption 5 holds, we set  $d_1^*$  as in this assumption. Then, with probability  $1 - \delta$ , the angular volume of global minima is lower bounded as,

$$
\mathcal {V} \left(\mathcal {G} (\mathbf {X}, \mathbf {y})\right) \dot {\geq} \exp \left(- d _ {1} ^ {*} d _ {0} \log N\right) \dot {\geq} \exp \left(- 2 N \log N\right).
$$

Proof idea: First, we lower bound  $\mathcal{V}(\mathcal{G})$  with the angular volume of a single differentiable region of one global minimum  $(\mathbf{W}^{*},\mathbf{z}^{*})$  - either from Theorem 8, or from assumption 5. Then we show that this angular volume is lower bounded when  $\mathbf{W}\sim \mathcal{N}$ , given a certain angular margin between the datapoints in  $\mathbf{X}$  and the rows of  $\mathbf{W}^*$ . We then calculate the probability of obtaining this margin when  $\mathbf{X}\sim \mathcal{N}$ . Combining both results, we obtain the final bound.

Main result: angular volume ratio. Finally, combining Theorems 6 and 9 it is straightforward to prove our main result in this paper, as we do in appendix section 11:

Theorem 10. Given assumptions 1-3, we set  $\delta \doteq \sqrt{\frac{8}{\pi}} d_0^{-1/2} + 2d_0^{1/2}\sqrt{\log d_0}/N$ . Then, with probability  $1 - \delta$ , the angular volume of sub-optimal DLMs, with MCE  $> \epsilon > 0$ , is exponentially vanishing in  $N$ , in comparison to the angular volume of global minima with MCE  $= 0$

$$
\frac {\mathcal {V} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {\epsilon} (\mathbf {X} , \mathbf {y})\right)}{\mathcal {V} \left(\mathcal {G} (\mathbf {X} , \mathbf {y})\right)} \dot {\leq} \exp \left(- \gamma_ {\epsilon} N ^ {3 / 4} \left[ d _ {1} d _ {0} \right] ^ {1 / 4}\right) \dot {\leq} \exp \left(- \gamma_ {\epsilon} N \log N\right).
$$

# 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

Theorem 10 implies that, with "asymptotically mild" over-parameterization (i.e. in which #parameters  $= \tilde{\Omega}(N)$ ), differentiable regions in weight space containing sub-optimal DLMs (with high MCE) are

Figure 5.1: Gaussian data: final training error (mean±std, 30 repetitions) in the overparameterized regime is low (right of the dashed black line). We trained MNNs with one and two hidden layers (with widths equal to  $d = d_0$ ) on a synthetic random dataset in which  $\forall n = 1, \dots, N$ ,  $\mathbf{x}^{(n)}$  was drawn from a normal distribution  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ , and  $y^{(n)} = \pm 1$  with probability 0.5.

Table 1: Binary classification of MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet: 1-hidden layer achieves very low training error (MCE) with a few hidden neurons, so that #parameters  $\approx d_0d_1\approx N$  . In ImageNet we downsampled the images to allow input whitening.

exponentially small in comparison with the same regions for global minima. Since these results are asymptotic in  $N \to \infty$ , in this section we examine it numerically for a finite number of samples and parameters. We perform experiments on random data, MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet-ILSVRC2012. In each experiment, we used ReLU activations ( $\rho = 0$ ), a binary classification target (we divided the original classes to two groups), MSE loss for optimization (eq. (2.3)), and MCE to determine classification error. Additional implementation details are given in appendix part III.

First, on the small synthetic Gaussian random data (matching our assumptions) we perform a scan on various networks and dataset sizes. With either one or two hidden layers (Figure 5.1), the error goes to zero when the number of non-redundant parameters (approximately  $d_0d_1$ ) is greater than the number of samples, as suggested by our asymptotic results. Second, on the non-syntehtic datasets, MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet (In ImageNet we downsampled the images to size  $64 \times 64$ , to allow input whitening) we only perform a simulation with a single 1-hidden layer MNN for which #parameters  $\approx N$ , and again find (Table 1) that the final error is zero (for MNIST and CIFAR) or very low (ImageNet).

Lastly, in Figure 5.2 we find that, on the Gaussian dataset, the inputs to the hidden neurons converge to a distinctly non-zero value. This indicates we converged to DLMs – since non-differentiable critical points must have zero neural inputs. Note that occasionally, during optimization, we could find some neural inputs with very low values near numerical precision level, so convergence to non-differentiable minima may be possible. However, as explained in the next section, as long as the number of neural inputs equal to zero are not too large, our bounds also hold for these minima.

# 6 DISCUSSION

In this paper we examine Differentiable Local Minima (DLMs) of the empiric loss of Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs) with one hidden layer, scalar output, and LReLU nonlinearities (section 2). We prove (Theorem 10) that with high probability the angular volume (definition 3) of sub-optimal DLMs is exponentially vanishing in comparison to the angular volume of global minima (definition 4), under assumptions 1-4. This results from an upper bound on sub-optimal DLMs (Theorem 6) and a lower bound on global minima (Theorem 9).

Figure 5.2: Gaussian data: convergence of the MSE to differentiable local minima, as indicated by the convergence of the neural inputs to distinctly non-zero values. We trained MNNs with one hidden layer on the Gaussian dataset from Figure 5.1, with various widths  $d = d_0 = d_1$  and  $N = \left\lfloor \frac{d^2}{5} \right\rfloor$  for 1000 epochs, then decreased the learning rate exponentially for another 1000 epochs. This was repeated 30 times. For all  $d$  and repeats, we see that (left) the final absolute value of the minimal neural input (i.e.,  $\min_{i,n} \left| \mathbf{w}_i^\top \mathbf{x}^{(n)} \right|$ ) in the range of  $10^{-3} - 10^0$ , which is much larger than (right) the final MSE error for all  $d$  and all repeats – in the range  $10^{-31} - 10^{-7}$ .

Convergence of SGD to DLMs. These results suggest a mechanism through which low training error is obtained in such MNNs. However, they do not guarantee it. One issue is that sub-optimal DLMs may have exponentially large basins of attraction. We see two possible paths that might address this issue in future work, using additional assumptions on  $\mathbf{y}$ . One approach is to show that, with high probability, no sub optimal DLM falls within the vanishingly small differentiable regions we bounded in Theorem 6. Another approach would be to bound the size of these basins of attraction, by showing that sufficiently large of number of differentiable regions near the DLM are also vanishingly small (other methods might also help here (Freeman & Bruna, 2016)). Another issue is that SGD might get stuck near differentiable saddle points, if their Hessian does not have strictly negative eigenvalues (i.e., the strict saddle property (Sun et al., 2015)). It should be straightforward to show that such points also have exponentially vanishing angular volume, similar to sub-optimal DLMs. Lastly, SGD might also

converge to non-differentiable critical points, which we discuss next.

Non-differentiable critical points. The proof of Theorem 6 stems from a first order necessary condition (Lemma 2):  $(\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) \mathbf{e} = 0$ , which is true for any DLM. However, non-differentiable critical points, in which some neural inputs are exactly zero, may also exist (though, numerically, they don't seem very common - see Figure 5.2). In this case, to derive a similar bound, we can replace the condition with  $\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) \mathbf{e} = 0$ , where  $\mathbf{P}$  is a projection matrix to the subspace orthogonal to the non-differentiable directions. As long as there are not too many zero neural inputs, we should be able to obtain similar results. For example, if only a constant ratio  $r$  of the neural inputs are zero, we can simply choose  $\mathbf{P}$  to remove all rows of  $(\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X})$  corresponding to those neurons, and proceed with exactly the same proof as before, with  $d_{1}$  replaced with  $(1 - r)d_{1}$ . It remains a theoretical challenge to find reasonable assumptions under which the number of non-differentiable directions (i.e., zero neural inputs) does not become too large.

Related results. Two works have also derived related results using the  $(\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X})\mathbf{e} = 0$  condition from Lemma 2. In (Soudry & Carmon, 2016), it was noticed that an infinitesimal perturbation of  $\mathbf{A}$  makes the matrix  $\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}$  full rank with probability 1 (Allman et al., 2009, Lemma 13) – which entails that  $\mathbf{e} = 0$  at all DLMs. Though a simple and intuitive approach, such an infinitesimal perturbation is problematic: from continuity, it cannot change the original MSE at sub-optimal DLMs – unless the weights go to infinity, or the DLM becomes non-differentiable – which are both undesirable results. An extension of this analysis was also done to constrain  $\mathbf{e}$  using the singular values of  $\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}$  (Xie et al., 2016), deriving bounds that are easier to combine with generalization bounds. Though a promising approach, the size of the sub-optimal regions (where the error is high) does not vanish exponentially in the derived bounds. More importantly, these bounds require assumptions on the activation kernel spectrum  $\gamma_{m}$ , which do not appear to hold in practice (e.g., (Xie et al., 2016, Theorems 1,3) require  $m\gamma_{m} \gg 1$  to hold with high probability, while  $m\gamma_{m} < 10^{-2}$  in (Xie et al., 2016, Figure 1)).

Modifications and extensions. There are many relatively simple extensions of these results: the Gaussian assumption could be relaxed to other near-isotropic distributions (e.g., sparse-land model, Elad, 2010, Section 9.2)) and other convex loss functions are possible instead of the quadratic loss. More challenging directions are extending our results to MNNs with multi-output and multiple hidden layers, or combining our training error results with novel generalization bounds which might be better suited for MNNs (e.g., (Feng et al., 2016; Sokolic et al., 2016; Dziugaite & Roy, 2017)) than previous approaches (Zhang et al., 2017a).
