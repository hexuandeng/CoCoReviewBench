# ABSTRACT

Modern neural network architectures often generalize well despite containing many more parameters than the size of the training dataset. This paper explores the generalization capabilities of neural networks trained via gradient descent. We develop a data-dependent optimization and generalization theory which leverages the low-rank structure of the Jacobian matrix associated with the network. Our results help demystify why training and generalization is easier on clean and structured datasets and harder on noisy and unstructured datasets as well as how the network size affects the evolution of the train and test errors during training. Specifically, we use a control knob to split the Jacobian spectrum into "information" and "nuisance" spaces associated with the large and small singular values. We show that over the information space learning is fast and one can quickly train a model with zero training loss that can also generalize well. Over the nuisance space training is slower and early stopping can help with generalization at the expense of some bias. We also show that the overall generalization capability of the network is controlled by how well the labels are aligned with the information space. A key feature of our results is that even constant width neural nets can provably generalize for sufficiently nice datasets. We conduct various numerical experiments on deep networks that corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that: (i) the Jacobian of typical neural networks exhibit low-rank structure with a few large singular values and many small ones leading to a low-dimensional information space, (ii) over the information space learning is fast and most of the labels falls on this space, and (iii) label noise falls on the nuisance space and impedes optimization/generalization.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

# 1.1 MOTIVATION AND CONTRIBUTIONS

Deep neural networks (DNN) are ubiquitous in a growing number of domains ranging from computer vision to healthcare. State-of-the-art DNN models are typically overparameterized and contain more parameters than the size of the training dataset. It is well understood that in this overparameterized regime, DNNs are highly expressive and have the capacity to (over)fit arbitrary training datasets including pure noise Zhang et al. (2016). Mysteriously however neural network models trained via simple algorithms such as (stochastic) gradient descent continue to predict well or generalize on yet unseen test data. In this paper we wish to take a step towards demystifying this phenomenon and help explain why neural nets can overfit to noise yet have the ability to generalize when real data sets are used for training. In particular we explore the generalization dynamics of neural nets trained via gradient descent. Using the Jacobian mapping associated with the neural network we characterize directions where learning is fast and generalizable versus directions where learning is slow and leads to overfitting. The main contributions of this work are as follows.

- Leveraging dataset structure: We develop new optimization and generalization results that can harness the low-rank representation of semantically meaningful datasets via the Jacobian mapping of the neural net. This sheds light as to why training and generalization is easier using datasets where the features and labels are semantically linked versus others where there is no meaningful relationship between the features and labels (even when the same network is used for training).

- Bias-variance tradeoffs: We develop a generalization theory based on the Jacobian which decouples the learning process into information and nuisance spaces. We show that gradient descent almost perfectly interpolates the data over the information space (incurring only a small bias). In contrast,

optimization over the nuisance space is slow and results in overfitting due to higher variance.

- Network size vs prediction bias: We obtain data-dependent tradeoffs between the network size and prediction bias. Specifically, we show that larger networks result in smaller prediction bias, but small networks can still generalize well, especially when the dataset is sufficiently structured, but typically incur a larger bias. This compares favorably with recent literature on optimization and generalization of neural networks Arora et al. (2019); Du et al. (2018b); Allen-Zhu et al. (2018b); Cao & Gu (2019); Ma et al. (2019); Allen-Zhu et al. (2018a); Brutzkus et al. (2017) where guarantees only hold for very wide networks with the width of the network growing inversely proportional to the class margins or related notions. See Section 3 for further detail.  
- Pretrained models: Our framework does not require random initialization and our results continue to apply even with arbitrary initialization. Therefore, our results may shed light on the generalization capabilities of networks initialized with pre-trained models commonly used in meta/transfer learning. Our extensive experiments strongly suggest Jacobian adapts over time in a favorable and data-dependent fashion shedding light on the properties of (pre)trained models.

# 1.2 MODEL AND TRAINING

Our theoretical analysis will focus on neural networks consisting of one hidden layer with  $d$  input features,  $k$  hidden neurons and  $K$  outputs as depicted in Figure 1. We use  $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$  and  $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times k}$  to denote the input-to-hidden and hidden-to-output weights. The overall input-output relationship of the network is a function  $f(\cdot; \mathbf{W}) : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^K$  that maps an input  $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  to an output via

$$
\boldsymbol {x} \mapsto f (\boldsymbol {x}; \boldsymbol {W}) := \boldsymbol {V} \phi (\boldsymbol {W} \boldsymbol {x}). \tag {1.1}
$$

Given a dataset consisting of  $n$  feature/label pairs  $(\pmb{x}_i,\pmb{y}_i)$  with  $\pmb{x}_i\in \mathbb{R}^d$  representing the features and  $\pmb{y}_i\in \mathbb{R}^K$  the associated labels representing one of  $K$  classes with one-hot encoding (i.e.  $\pmb{y}_i\in \{e_1,e_2,\dots ,e_K\}$  where  $\pmb{e}_{\ell}\in \mathbb{R}^{K}$  has all zero entries except for the  $\ell$ th entry which is equal to one).

To learn this dataset, we fix the output layer and train over  $\mathbf{W}$  via

$$
\min  _ {\boldsymbol {W} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {k \times d}} \mathcal {L} (\boldsymbol {W}) := \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \| \boldsymbol {V} \phi (\boldsymbol {W} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i}) - \boldsymbol {y} _ {i} \| _ {\ell_ {2}} ^ {2}. \tag {1.2}
$$

It will be convenient to concatenate the labels and prediction vectors as follows

$$
\boldsymbol {y} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \boldsymbol {y} _ {1} \\ \vdots \\ \boldsymbol {y} _ {n} \end{array} \right] \in \mathbb {R} ^ {n K} \quad \text {a n d} \quad f (\boldsymbol {W}) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \boldsymbol {V} f (\boldsymbol {x} _ {1}; \boldsymbol {W}) \\ \vdots \\ \boldsymbol {V} f (\boldsymbol {x} _ {n}; \boldsymbol {W}) \end{array} \right] \in \mathbb {R} ^ {n K}. \tag {1.3}
$$

Using this shorthand we can rewrite the loss (1.2) as

$$
\min  _ {\boldsymbol {W} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {k \times d}} \mathcal {L} (\boldsymbol {W}) := \frac {1}{2} \| f (\boldsymbol {W}) - \boldsymbol {y} \| _ {\ell_ {2}} ^ {2}. \tag {1.4}
$$

To optimize this loss starting from an initialization  $\mathbf{W}_0$  we run gradient descent iterations of the form

$$
\boldsymbol {W} _ {\tau + 1} = \boldsymbol {W} _ {\tau} - \eta \nabla \mathcal {L} (\boldsymbol {W} _ {\tau}), \tag {1.5}
$$

with a step size  $\eta$ . In this paper we wish to explore the theoretical properties of the model found by such iterative updates with an emphasis on the generalization ability.

# 1.3 INFORMATION AND NUISANCE SPACES

In order to understand the generalization capabilities of models trained via gradient descent we need to develop better insights into the form of the gradient updates and how it affects the training dynamics.

(b) Depiction in parameter space

To this aim let us aggregate the weights at each iteration into one large vector  $\boldsymbol{w}_{\tau} \coloneqq \mathrm{vec}\big(\boldsymbol{W}_{\tau}\big) \in \mathbb{R}^{kd}$ , define the misfit/residual vector  $\boldsymbol{r}(\boldsymbol{w}) \coloneqq f(\boldsymbol{w}) - \boldsymbol{y}$  and note that the gradient updates take the form

$$
\boldsymbol {w} _ {\tau + 1} = \boldsymbol {w} _ {\tau} - \eta \nabla \mathcal {L} (\boldsymbol {w} _ {\tau}) \quad \text {w h e r e} \quad \nabla \mathcal {L} (\boldsymbol {w}) = \nabla \mathcal {L} (\boldsymbol {w}) = \mathcal {J} (\boldsymbol {w}) ^ {T} \boldsymbol {r} (\boldsymbol {w}).
$$

Here,  $\mathcal{J}(\boldsymbol{w}) \in \mathbb{R}^{nK \times kd}$  denotes the Jacobian mapping associated with  $f$  defined as  $\mathcal{J}(\boldsymbol{w}) = \frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{w})}{\partial \boldsymbol{w}}$ . Due to the form of the gradient updates the dynamics of training is dictated by the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix as well as the interaction between the residual vector and the Jacobian. If the residual vector is very well aligned with the singular vectors associated with the top singular values of  $\mathcal{J}(\boldsymbol{w})$ , the gradient update significantly reduces the misfit allowing substantial reduction in the train error. Thus to provide a more precise understanding of the training dynamics and generalization capabilities of neural networks it is crucial to develop a better understanding of the interaction between the Jacobian and the misfit and label vectors. To capture these interactions we require a few definitions.

Definition 1.1 (Information & Nuisance Spaces) Consider a matrix  $J \in \mathbb{R}^{nK \times p}$  with singular value decomposition given by

$$
\boldsymbol {J} = \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {n K} \lambda_ {s} \boldsymbol {u} _ {s} \boldsymbol {v} _ {s} ^ {T} = \boldsymbol {U} d i a g \left(\lambda_ {1}, \lambda_ {2}, \dots , \lambda_ {n K}\right) \boldsymbol {V} ^ {T},
$$

with  $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \ldots \geq \lambda_{nK}$  denoting the singular values of  $\mathbf{J}$  in decreasing order and  $\{\pmb{u}_s\}_{s=1}^{nK} \in \mathbb{R}^{nK}$  and  $\{\pmb{v}_s\}_{s=1}^{nK} \in \mathbb{R}^p$  the corresponding left and right singular vectors forming the orthonormal basis matrices  $\pmb{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{nK \times nK}$  and  $\pmb{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times nK}$ . For a spectrum cutoff  $\alpha$  obeying  $0 \leq \alpha \leq \lambda_1$  let  $r := r(\alpha)$  denote the index of the smallest singular value above  $\alpha$ . We define the information and nuisance spaces associated with  $\pmb{J}$  as  $\mathcal{I} := \text{span}(\{\pmb{u}_s\}_{s=1}^r)$  and  $\mathcal{N} := \text{span}(\{\pmb{u}_s\}_{s=r+1}^{Kn})$ .

In this paper we shall use either the expected value of the Jacobian at the random initialization or the Jacobian at one of the iterates to define the matrix  $J$  and the corresponding information/nuisance spaces. More, specifically we will set  $J$  to either  $J = \left(\mathbb{E}\left[\mathcal{J}(W_0)\mathcal{J}^T(W_0)\right]\right)^{1/2}$  or  $J = \mathcal{J}(W_\tau)$ . Therefore, one can effectively think of the information space as the span of the prominent singular vectors of the Jacobian and the nuisance space as its complement. In particular, as we demonstrate in Section 4 the Jacobian mapping associated with neural networks exhibit low-rank structure with a few large singular values and many small ones leading to natural choices for the cut-off value  $\alpha$  as well as the information and nuisance spaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate both (empirically and theoretically) that learning is fast over the information space leading to a significant reduction in both train/test accuracy in the early stages of training. However, after a certain number of iterations learning shifts to the nuisance space and reduction in the training error significantly slows down (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, subsequent iterations in this stage lead to a slight increase in test error.

# 2 MAIN RESULTS

Our main results establish multi-class generalization bounds for neural networks trained via gradient descent. First, we will focus on networks where both layers are randomly initialized. Next we will

provide guarantees for arbitrary initialization with the goal of characterizing the generalization ability of subsequent iterative updates for a given (possibly pre-trained) network in terms of its Jacobian mapping. In this paper we focus on activations  $\phi$  which are smooth and have bounded first and second order derivatives. This would for instance apply to the softplus activation  $\phi(z) = \log(1 + e^z)$ . We note that utilizing a proof technique developed in Oymak & Soltanolkotabi (2019) for going from smooth to ReLU activations it is possible to extend our results to ReLU activations with proper modifications. We avoid doing this in the current paper for clarity of exposition. Before we begin discussing our main results we discuss some notation used throughout the paper. For a matrix  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$  we use  $s_{\min}(X)$  and  $s_{\max}(X) = \|X\|$  to denote the minimum and maximum singular value of  $X$ . For two matrices  $A$  and  $B$  we use  $A \odot B$  and  $A \otimes B$  to denote their Hadamard and Kronecker products, respectively. For a PSD matrix  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  with eigenvalue decomposition  $A = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i u_i u_i^T$ , the square root matrix is defined as  $A^{1/2} \coloneqq \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{\lambda_i} u_i u_i^T$ . We also use  $A^\dagger$  to denote the pseudo-inverse of  $A$ . In this paper we mostly focus on label vectors  $\pmb{y}$  which are one-hot encoded i.e. all entries are zero except one of them. For a subspace  $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$  and point  $\pmb{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ ,  $\Pi_S(\pmb{x})$  denotes the projection of  $\pmb{x}$  onto  $S$ . Finally, before stating our results we need to provide a quantifiable measure of performance for a trained model. Given a sample  $(\pmb{x}, \pmb{y}) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^K$  from a distribution  $\mathcal{D}$ , the classification error of the network  $\pmb{W}$  with respect to  $\mathcal{D}$  is defined as

$$
\operatorname {E r r} _ {\mathcal {D}} (\boldsymbol {W}) = \mathbb {P} \left\{\arg \max  _ {1 \leq \ell \leq K} \boldsymbol {y} _ {\ell} \neq \arg \max  _ {1 \leq \ell \leq K} f _ {\ell} (\boldsymbol {x}; \boldsymbol {W}) \right\}. \tag {2.1}
$$

# 2.1 RESULTS FOR RANDOM INITIALIZATION

To explore the generalization of randomly initialized networks, we utilize the neural tangent kernel.

Definition 2.1 (Multiclass Neural Tangent Kernel (M-NTK) Jacot et al. (2018)) Let  $\pmb{w} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  be a vector with  $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}_d)$  distribution. Consider a set of  $n$  input data points  $\pmb{x}_1,\pmb{x}_2,\dots,\pmb{x}_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$  aggregated into the rows of a data matrix  $\pmb{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ . Associated to the activation  $\phi$  and the input data matrix  $\pmb{X}$  we define the multiclass kernel matrix as

$$
\boldsymbol {\Sigma} (\boldsymbol {X}) := \boldsymbol {I} _ {K} \otimes \mathbb {E} \left[ \left(\phi^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {X} \boldsymbol {w}) \phi^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {X} \boldsymbol {w}) ^ {T}\right) \odot (\boldsymbol {X} \boldsymbol {X} ^ {T}) \right],
$$

where  $I_K$  is the identity matrix of size  $K$ . Here, the  $\ell$ th diagonal block of  $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(\boldsymbol{X})$  corresponds to the kernel matrix associated with the  $\ell$ th network output for  $1 \leq \ell \leq K$ . This kernel is intimately related to the multiclass Jacobian mapping. In particular, suppose the initial input weights  $\boldsymbol{W}_0$  are distributed i.i.d.  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$  and the output layer  $\boldsymbol{V}$  has i.i.d. zero-mean entries with  $\nu^2 / K$  variance. Then  $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{J}(\boldsymbol{W}_0) \mathcal{J}(\boldsymbol{W}_0)^T] = \nu^2 \boldsymbol{\Sigma}(\boldsymbol{X})$ . We use the square root of this multiclass kernel matrix (i.e.  $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(\boldsymbol{X})^{1/2}$ ) to define the information and nuisance spaces for our random initialization result.

The following theorem is a (non-rigorous) simplification of our main result Theorem 6.24 where we ignore constants and log factors, and state a weaker but simpler generalization bound.

Theorem 2.2 Fix numbers  $\Gamma \geq 1$  and  $\alpha >0$ . Consider an i.i.d. training dataset  $\{(\pmb {x}_i,\pmb {y}_i)\}_{i = 1}^n\in$ $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}^K$  with unit length input samples and one-hot encoded labels. Consider the neural net in (1.1) parameterized by  $\pmb{W}$  and initialized with  $W_0\stackrel {i,i,d}{\sim}\mathcal{N}(0,1)$  entries. Set  $\pmb{V}$  with i.i.d. Rademacher entries (properly scaled). Define the information  $\mathcal{I}$  and nuisance  $\mathcal{N}$  spaces with respect to  $\Sigma (X)^{1 / 2}$  with spectrum cutoff  $\alpha \sqrt{nK}$  per Definition 1.1. Furthermore, assume

$$
k \gtrsim \frac {\Gamma^ {4} \log n}{\alpha^ {8}}. \tag {2.2}
$$

Then after  $T \propto \Gamma / \alpha^2$  gradient iterations of (1.5), with high probability, training loss obeys

$$
\left\| f \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {T}\right) - \boldsymbol {y} \right\| _ {\ell_ {2}} \lesssim \left\| \Pi_ {\mathcal {N}} (\boldsymbol {y}) \right\| _ {\ell_ {2}} + \mathrm {e} ^ {- \Gamma} \sqrt {n}. \tag {2.3}
$$

Furthermore, the classification error obeys

$$
E r r _ {\mathcal {D}} (\boldsymbol {W} _ {T}) \lesssim \frac {\| \Pi_ {\mathcal {N}} (\boldsymbol {y}) \| _ {\ell_ {2}}}{\sqrt {n}} + \mathrm {e} ^ {- \Gamma} + \frac {\Gamma}{\alpha \sqrt {n}}.
$$

This theorem shows that even networks of moderate width can achieve a small generalization error if (1) the data has low-dimensional representation i.e. the kernel is approximately low-rank and (2) the inputs and labels are semantically-linked i.e. the label vector  $\mathbf{y}$  mostly lies on the information space.

- Generalization bound: The generalization error has two core components: bias and variance. The bias component  $\| \Pi_{\mathcal{N}}(\boldsymbol{y}) \|_{\ell_2} / \sqrt{n} + \mathrm{e}^{-\Gamma}$  arises from the training loss and corresponds to the portion of the labels that falls over the nuisance space. The variance component  $\Gamma / \alpha \sqrt{n}$  corresponds to the Rademacher complexity of the model space which connects to the distance  $\| \boldsymbol{W}_T - \boldsymbol{W}_0 \|_F$ .

If  $\pmb{y}$  is aligned with the information space, the bias term  $\Pi_{\mathcal{N}}(\pmb{y})$  will be small. Additionally, if the kernel matrix is low-rank, we can pick a large  $\alpha$  to ensure small variance as well as small network width. In particular with a constant  $\alpha$  the required network width is logarithmic in  $n$ .

We note however that our results continue to apply even when the kernel is not approximately low-rank. In particular, consider the extreme case where we select  $\alpha \sqrt{nK} = \sqrt{\lambda} \coloneqq \sqrt{\lambda_{\min}(\Sigma(X))}$ . This sets  $\mathcal{I} = \mathbb{R}^{Kn}$  and  $\| \Pi_{\mathcal{N}}(\boldsymbol{y}) \|_{\ell_2} = 0$ . For this case, the more general Theorem 6.24 yields

$$
\operatorname {E r r} _ {\mathcal {D}} \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {T}\right) \lesssim \frac {\sqrt {K}}{\sqrt {n}} \sqrt {\boldsymbol {y} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {\Sigma} ^ {- 1} (\boldsymbol {X}) \boldsymbol {y}} \quad \text {w h i l e r e q u i r i n g a w i d t h o f} \quad k \gtrsim \frac {K ^ {4} n ^ {4} \log n}{\lambda^ {4}}. \tag {2.4}
$$

We note that in this special case our results improve upon the required width in recent literature Arora et al.  $(2019)^{2}$  that focuses on  $K = 1$  and a conclusion of the form (2.4). However, as we demonstrate in our numerical experiments in practice  $\lambda$  is very small or even zero (e.g. see the toy model in Section 2.3) so that requirements of the form (2.4) may require unrealistically (or even infinitely) wide networks. In contrast, our results apply to all Jacobian spectrums, however can further harness the low-rank structure of the Jacobian to give even stronger bounds.

- Small width is sufficient for generalization: Based on our simulations the M-NTK indeed has low-rank structure with a few large eigenvalues and many smaller ones. As a result a reasonable scaling choice of  $\alpha$  is constant. In that case our result states that as soon as the number of hidden nodes are logarithmic in  $n$ , good generalization can be achieved. This favorably compares to related works Arora et al. (2019); Du et al. (2018b); Allen-Zhu et al. (2018b); Cao & Gu (2019) where network size is required to grow polynomial with  $n$  and inversely with the distance between the inputs or other notions of margin.  
- Network size-Bias tradeoff: Based on the requirement (2.2) if the network is large (in terms of # of hidden units  $k$ ), we can choose a small cut-off  $\alpha$ . This in turn allows us to enlargen the information space and reduce the training bias further. In summary, as the network capacity grows, we can gradually interpolate finer detail and reduce bias.  
- Fast convergence: Note that the number of gradient iterations is upper bounded by  $\Gamma/\alpha^2$ . Hence, the training speed is dictated by and is inversely proportional to the smallest singular value over the information space. Specifically, picking  $\alpha$  to be a constant, convergence on the information space will be fast requiring only a constant number of iterations to reach any fixed accuracy (see (2.3)).

# 2.2 GENERALIZATION GUARANTEES WITH ARBITRARY INITIALIZATION

Our next result provides generalization guarantees from an arbitrary initialization which applies to pre-trained networks (e.g. those that arise in transfer learning applications) as well as intermediate gradient iterates as the weights evolve. This result has a similar flavor to Theorem 2.2 with the key difference that the information and nuisance spaces are defined with respect to any arbitrary initial Jacobian. This shows that if a pre-trained model<sup>3</sup> provides a better low-rank representation of the data in terms of its Jacobian, it is more likely to generalize well. Furthermore, given its deterministic nature the theorem can be applied at any iteration, implying that if the Jacobians of any of the iterates provide a better low-rank representation of the data then one can provide sharper generalization guarantees. The following theorem is a (non-rigorous) simplification of Theorem 6.21.

Theorem 2.3 Let  $\Gamma \geq 1, \alpha$  be arbitrary scalars. Consider i.i.d. training data  $\{(\pmb{x}_i, \pmb{y}_i)\}_{i=1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^K$  with unit length inputs and one-hot encoded labels. Also consider a neural net with  $k$  hidden nodes as in (1.1) parameterized by  $\pmb{W}$ . Let  $\pmb{W}_0$  be an arbitrary initial weight matrix and assume the output matrix has bounded entries obeying  $\| \pmb{V} \|_{\ell_\infty} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{kK}}$ . Define the nuisance space  $\mathcal{N}$  associated with  $\mathcal{J}(\pmb{W}_0)$  based on spectrum cutoff  $\alpha \sqrt{n}$ . Set the initial residual  $\pmb{r}_0 = f(\pmb{W}_0) - \pmb{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{nK}$  and

assume  $\| r_0\|_{\ell_2}\lesssim \sqrt{n}$ . Suppose  $k\gtrsim \Gamma^4 /\alpha^8$ . After  $T\propto \Gamma /\alpha^{2}$  iterations (1.5) with constant learning rate, training loss obeys

$$
\left\| f \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {T}\right) - \boldsymbol {y} \right\| _ {\ell_ {2}} \lesssim \left\| \Pi_ {\mathcal {N}} (\boldsymbol {r} _ {0}) \right\| _ {\ell_ {2}} + \mathrm {e} ^ {- \Gamma} \sqrt {n}
$$

and with high probability, classification error obeys  $\text{Err}_{\mathcal{D}}(\boldsymbol{W}_T) \lesssim \frac{\|\Pi_{\mathcal{N}}(\boldsymbol{r}_0)\|_{\ell_2}}{\sqrt{n}} + \mathrm{e}^{-\Gamma} + \frac{\Gamma}{\alpha \sqrt{n}}$ .

As with the random initialization result, this theorem shows that as long as the initial residual is sufficiently correlated with the information space, then high accuracy can be achieved for neural networks with reasonable size. As with its randomized counterpart this result also allows us to study various tradeoffs between bias-variance and network size-bias. Crucially however this result does not rely on random initialization. The reason this is particularly important is two fold. First, in many scenarios neural networks are not initialized at random. For instance, in transfer learning the network is pre-trained via data from a different domain. Second, as we demonstrate in Section 4 as the iterates progress the Jacobian mapping develops more favorable properties with the labels/initial residuals becoming more correlated with the information space of the Jacobian. As mentioned earlier, due to its deterministic nature the theorem above applies in both of these scenarios. In particular, if a pre-trained model provides a better low-rank representation of the data via its Jacobian, it is more likely to generalize well. Furthermore, given its deterministic nature the theorem can be applied at any iteration by setting  $\mathbf{W}_0 = \mathbf{W}_{\tau}$ , implying that if the Jacobians of any of the iterates provides a better low-rank representation then one can provide better generalization guarantees. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the Jacobian of the neural network adapts to the dataset over time with a more substantial amount of the labels lying on the information space. While we defer the rigorous theory of this adaptation to future, Section D provides a proof sketch of evolution of Jacobian rank for a simple dataset model. Such a result when combined with our result above can potentially provide significantly tighter bounds. This is particularly important in light of recent literature Chizat & Bach (2018b); Ghorbani et al. (2019c); Yehudai & Shamir (2019) suggesting a significant generalization gap between kernel methods/linearized neural nets when compared with neural nets operating beyond the linearized regime (e.g. mean field regime). As a result we view our deterministic result as a first step towards moving beyond the NTK regime.

# 2.3 CASE STUDY: GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL

To illustrate a concrete example, we consider a distribution based on multiclass mixture models.

Definition 2.4 (Gaussian mixture model) Consider a size  $n$  dataset  $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^K$ . We assume this dataset consists of  $K$  classes each comprising of  $C$  clusters with a total of  $KC$  clusters. We index each cluster with  $(\ell, \widetilde{\ell})$  denoting the  $\ell$ th cluster from the  $\ell$ th class. We assume the dataset in cluster  $(\ell, \widetilde{\ell})$  is centered around a cluster center  $\pmb{\mu}_{\ell, \widetilde{\ell}} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  with unit Euclidean norm. We assume the dataset is generated i.i.d. with the cluster membership assigned uniformly of the clusters with probability  $\frac{1}{KC}$  and the input samples associated with the cluster  $(\ell, \widetilde{\ell})$  are generated i.i.d. according to  $\mathcal{N}\left(\pmb{\mu}_{\ell, \widetilde{\ell}}, \sigma^2 I_d / d\right)$  with the corresponding label set to the one-hot encoding of the class  $\ell$  i.e.  $e_\ell$ . Note that the cluster indexed by  $(\ell, \widetilde{\ell})$  contains  $\widetilde{n}_{\ell, \widetilde{\ell}}$  data points satisfying  $\mathbb{E}[\widetilde{n}_{\ell, \widetilde{\ell}}] = \widetilde{n} = n / KC$ .

This distribution is an ideal candidate to demonstrate why the Jacobian of the network exhibits low-rank or bimodal structure. Let us consider the extreme case  $\sigma = 0$  where we have a discrete input distribution over the cluster centers. In this scenario, the multi-class Jacobian matrix is at most rank

$$
K ^ {2} C = \# \text {o f o u t p u t n o d e s} \times \# \text {o f d i s t i n c t i n p u t s}.
$$

as there are (i) only  $KC$  distinct input vectors and (ii)  $K$  output nodes. We can thus set the information space to be the top  $K^2 C$  eigenvectors of the multiclass kernel matrix  $\pmb{\Sigma}(\pmb{X})$ . As formalized in the appendix, it can be shown that

- The singular values of the information space grow proportionally with  $n / KC$ .  
- The concatenated label vector  $\mathbf{y}$  perfectly lies on the information space.

In Figure 3 we numerically verify that the approximate rank and singular values of the Jacobian indeed scale as above even when  $\sigma >0$ . The following informal theorem leverages these observations to establish a generalization bound for this mixture model. This informal statement is for exposition purposes. See Theorem A.3 in Appendix A for a more detailed result capturing the exact dependencies (e.g.  $\zeta, B, \log n$ ). In this theorem we use  $\gtrsim$  to denote inequality up to constant/logarithmic factors.

Theorem 2.5 (Generalization for Gaussian Mixture Models-simplified) Consider a data set of size  $n$  consisting of input/label pairs  $\{(\pmb{x}_i, \pmb{y}_i)\}_{i=1}^n \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^K$  generated according to Def. 2.4 with the standard deviation obeying  $\sigma \lesssim \frac{K}{n}$ . Let  $M = [\pmb{\mu}_{1,1} \dots \pmb{\mu}_{K,C}]^T$  be the matrix obtained by aggregating all the cluster centers and let  $g \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$ . Also let  $\Sigma(M) \in \mathbb{R}^{KC \times KC}$  be the M-NTK associated with the cluster centers  $M$  per Def. 2.1. Furthermore, set  $\lambda_M = \lambda_{\min}(\Sigma(M))$ , and assume  $\lambda_M > 0$ . If the number of hidden nodes obeys  $k \gtrsim \frac{\Gamma^4 K^8 C^4}{\lambda_M^4}$ . after  $T = \frac{2\Gamma K^2 C}{\lambda_M}$  gradient iterations, with high probability, the model obeys  $Err_D(W_T) \lesssim \Gamma \sqrt{\frac{K^2 C}{n \lambda_M}}$ .

We note that  $\lambda_{M}$  captures how diverse the cluster centers are. In this sense  $\lambda_{M} > 0$  intuitively means that neural network, specifically the neural tangent kernel, is sufficiently expressive to interpolate the cluster centers. In fact when the cluster centers are in generic position  $\lambda_{M}$  scales like a constant Oymak & Soltanolkotabi (2019). This theorem focuses on the regime where the noise level  $\sigma$  is small. In this case one can achieve good generalization as soon as the sample size scales as  $n\gtrsim K^2 C$  which is the effective rank of the M-NTK matrix. This result follows from our main result with random initialization by setting the cutoff at  $\alpha^2\sim \frac{\lambda_M}{K^2C}$ . This demonstrates that in this model  $\alpha$  does indeed scale as a constant. Finally, the required network width is independent of  $n$  and only depends on  $K$  and  $C$  specifically  $k\gtrsim K^{8}C^{4}$ . This compares favorably with Arora et al. (2019) which concerns the  $K = 1$  case. In particular, Arora et al. (2019) requires  $k\gtrsim n^8 /\lambda_X^6$  which depends on  $n$  (in lieu of  $K$  and  $C$ ) and the minimum eigenvalue  $\lambda_{X}$  of the NTK matrix  $\Sigma (\boldsymbol {X})$  (rather than  $\lambda_{M}$ ). Furthermore, as  $\sigma \rightarrow 0$ ,  $\Sigma (X)$  becomes rank deficient and  $\lambda_{X}\rightarrow 0$  so that Arora et al. (2019) requires infinite width.

Figure 3: The singular values of the normalized Jacobian spectrum  $\sqrt{\frac{KC}{n}}\mathcal{J}(\boldsymbol{W}_0)$  of a neural network with  $K = 3$ . Here, the data is generated according to the Def. 2.4 with  $K$  classes and  $\sigma = 0.1$ . The cluster centers are picked so that the distance between any two is at least 0.5. We consider two cases:  $n = 30C$  (solid line) and  $n = 60C$  (dashed line). These plots demonstrate that the top  $KC$  singular values grow proportional to  $\sqrt{n}$ .

Neural networks have impressive generalization abilities even when they are trained with more parameters than the data Zhang et al. (2016). Thus, optimization/generalization properties of neural nets have been the topic of recent literature Zhang et al. (2016). Below we discuss the works on statistical learning, optimization, and implicit bias.

Statistical learning theory: Statistical properties of neural networks have been studied since 1990's Anthony & Bartlett (2009); Bartlett et al. (1999); Bartlett (1998). With the success of deep networks, there is a renewed interest in understanding capacity of the neural networks under different norm constraints or network architectures Dziugaite & Roy (2017); Arora et al. (2018); Neyshabur et al. (2017b); Golowich et al. (2017). Bartlett et al. (2017); Neyshabur et al. (2017a) established tight sample complexity results for deep networks based on spectral norms. See also Nagarajan & Kolter (2019) for improvements via leveraging various properties of the inter-layer Jacobian and Long & Sedghi (2019) for results with convolutional networks. Related, Arora et al. (2018) leverages compression techniques for constructing tighter bounds. Yin et al. (2018) jointly studies statistical learning and adversarial robustness. These interesting results, provide generalization guarantees for the optimal solution to the empirical risk minimizer.

Properties of gradient descent: There is a growing understanding that solutions found by first-order methods such as gradient descent have often favorable properties. Generalization properties of stochastic gradient descent is extensively studied empirically Keskar et al. (2016); Hardt et al. (2015); Sagun et al. (2017); Chaudhari et al. (2016); Hoffer et al. (2017); Goel & Klivans (2017); Goel et al. (2018). For linearly separable datasets, Soudry et al. (2018); Gunasekar et al. (2018); Brutzkus et al. (2017); Ji & Telgarsky (2018a;b) show that first-order methods find solutions that generalize well without an explicit regularization for logistic regression. An interesting line of work establish connection between kernel methods and neural networks and study the generalization abilities of

kernel methods when the model interpolates the training data Dou & Liang (2019); Belkin et al. (2018a;b; 2019); Liang & Rakhlin (2018); Belkin et al. (2018c). Chizat & Bach (2018a); Song et al. (2018); Mei et al. (2018); Sirignano & Spiliopoulos (2018); Rotskoff & Vanden-Eijnden (2018) relate the distribution of the network weights to Wasserstein gradient flows using mean field analysis.

Global convergence and generalization of neural nets: Closest to our work, recent literature Cao & Gu (2019); Arora et al. (2019); Ma et al. (2019); Allen-Zhu et al. (2018a) provides generalization bounds for overparameterized networks trained via gradient descent. Also see Li et al. (2018); Huang et al. (2019) for interesting visualization of the optimization and generalization landscape. Similar to Thm 2.2, Arora et al. (2019) uses the NTK to provide generalization guarantees (see (2.4) for comparison). Li et al. (2019a) leverages low-rank Jacobian structure to establish robustness to label noise. Very recent work Su & Yang (2019) uses low-rankness to better capture approximation power of neural nets. These works build on global convergence results of randomly initialized networks Du et al. (2018b;a); Allen-Zhu et al. (2018b); Chizat & Bach (2018b); Zhang et al. (2019); Nitanda & Suzuki (2019); Oymak & Soltanolkotabi (2018); Zou et al. (2018) which study the gradient descent trajectory via comparisons to a NTK linearization. These results however typically require unrealistically wide networks for optimization where the width grows poly in  $n$  and poly-inversely proportional to the distance between the input samples. Example distance measures are class margin for logistic loss and minimum eigenvalue of the NTK matrix for least-squares. Our work circumvents this issue by allowing a capacity-dependent interpolation. We prove that even small networks (e.g. of constant width) can interpolate the data over a low-dimensional information space without making restrictive assumptions on the input. This approach also leads to faster convergence rates. In terms of generalization, our work has three distinguishing features: (a) bias-variance tradeoffs by identifying information/nuisance spaces, (b) no margin/distance/minimum eigenvalue assumptions on data, (c) the bounds apply to multiclass classification as well as pre-trained networks (Theorem 2.3).

Finally, low-rankness of the Jacobian plays a central role in this work. Hessian and Jacobian of neural nets are investigated by multiple papers which contain related findings on the bimodal (approximately low-rank) spectrum Papyan (2018); Ghorbani et al. (2019b); Papyan (2019b); Sagun et al. (2017); Li et al. (2019b); Javadi et al. (2019). Our key empirical contribution is establishing (in great detail) that multiclass Jacobian adapts over time to align its information space with the labels to better represent the data. This alignment leads to tighter generalization bounds in our analysis shedding light on representation learning and gradient dynamics beyond NTK.

# 4 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

We present experiments demonstrating our theoretical findings on two popular image classification datasets. In this section we focus on a set of CIFAR-10 experiments and discuss how our theory is strongly supported by what we observe in practice. To provide more detail and show that our theory holds across different datasets, in addition to the experiments discussed in this section we perform additional experiments on a modified 3-class version of CIFAR-10 and MNIST in Appendix C.

Figure 4: Histogram of the top 1000 Jacobian singular values on the CIFAR10 dataset.

Experimental setup. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of  $50k$  training images and  $10k$  test images in 10 classes. We demonstrate our results on ResNet20, a

state-of-the-art architecture with a fairly low test error on this dataset (8.75% test error reported) and relatively few parameters (0.27M). In all of our experiments we set the information space to be the span of the top 50 singular vectors (out of total dimension of  $Kn \approx 500000$ ) of the neural network Jacobian. In order to be consistent with our theoretical formulation we make the following modifications to the default ResNet20 architecture: (1) we scale the output of the final fully connected layer to ensure that the output is small, consistent with Theorem 2.2 (2) we turn off batch normalization and (3) we do not pass the network output through a soft-max function. We train the network with SGD on least-squares loss with batch size 128 and without any form of data augmentation. We set the initial learning rate to 0.1 and adjust the learning rate schedule and number of epochs depending on the particular experiment so as to achieve a good fit to the training data quickly. The figures in this section depict the minimum error over a window consisting of the last

10 epochs for visual clarity. We also conduct two sets of experiments to illustrate the results on uncorrupted and corrupted data. In this section we highlight some of these results and relate them to our theoretical framework. For the complete set of experiments we refer the reader to Appendix C.

Jacobian eigenstructure. Calculating the exact full singular value decomposition of the Jacobian at this scale  $(500k\times 270k)$  is not tractable due to computation/memory limitations. In order to verify the bimodal structure of the Jacobian with exact singular values we plot the histogram of the top 1000 singular values of the Jacobian mapping at initialization and after training in Figure 4. This figure clearly demonstrates that the Jacobian has low-rank structure. In both cases we observe that singular values are concentrated around zero with a relatively small density distributed over higher singular values. This observation serves as a natural basis for decomposition of the label space into information  $\mathcal{L}$  (large singular values, low-dimensional) and nuisance space  $\mathcal{N}$  (small singular values, high-dimensional). We note that while calculating all the eigenvalues is not possible, we verify the bimodal structure of the entire Jacobian spectrum by approximating its spectral density in App. C.

Experiments without label corruption. First, we present experiments on the original training data described above with no label corruption. We train the network for 400 epochs to achieve a good fit to the training data. Our theory predicts that the sum of  $\left\| J_{\mathcal{I}}^{\dagger}\boldsymbol {y}\right\|_{\ell_2}$  and  $\left\| \Pi_{\mathcal{N}}(\boldsymbol {y})\right\|_{\ell_2}$  determines the classification error (Theorems 2.2 and 6.24). Table 1 collects these values for the initial and final Jacobian. These values demonstrate that the label vector is indeed correlated with the top eigenvectors of both the initial and final Jacobians. An interesting aspect of these results is that this correlation increases from the initial to the final Jacobian so that more of the label energy lies on the information space of the final Jacobian in comparison with the initial Jacobian. Stated differently, we observe a significant adaptation of the Jacobian to the labels after training compared to the initial Jacobian so that our predictions become more and more accurate as the iterates progress. In particular, the first column of Table 1 shows that the fraction of label energy lying on the information subspace of the Jacobian drastically increases after training (from 0.38 to 0.99). Consequently, less energy falls on the nuisance space (decreases from 0.92 to 0.16 after training), while  $\left\| J_{\mathcal{I}}^{\dagger}\boldsymbol {y}\right\|_{\ell_2}$  remains relatively small resulting in better generalization. Towards explaining these, Section D provides a preliminary analysis showing Jacobian spectrum indeed adapts to data.

We also track the projection of the residual  $r_{\tau}$  on the information and nuisance subspaces throughout training on both training and test data and depict the results in Figures 5a and 5b. In agreement with our theory, these plots show that learning on  $\mathcal{I}$  is fast and the residual energy decreases rapidly on this space. On the other hand, residual energy on  $\mathcal{N}$  goes down rather slowly and the decrease in total residual energy is overwhelmingly governed by  $\mathcal{I}$ , suggesting that most information relevant to learning lies in this space. We also plot the training and test error in Figure 5c. We observe that as learning progresses, the residual on both spaces decrease in tandem with training and test error.

Table 2: Depiction of the alignment of the initial residual with the information/nuisance space using  $50\%$  label corrupted data and a Multi-class ResNet20 trained with SGD.

Experiments with label corruption. Our next experiments study the effect of corruption. Specifically, we corrupt  $50\%$  of the labels by randomly picking a label from a (strictly) different class. We train the network for 800 epochs and divide the learning rate by 10 at epoch 760 to fit to the training data.

We again track the projection of the residual  $r_{\tau}$  on the information/nuisance spaces throughout training on both training and test data and depict the results in Figs 6a and 6b. We also track the train and test errors in Figure 6c. From Figure 6c it is evident that while the training error steadily decreases, test error exhibits a very different behavior compared to the uncorrupted experiment. In the first phase, test error drops rapidly as the network learns from information contained in the uncorrupted data, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in residual energy on the information subspace on the training data (Figure 6a). The lowest test error is observed at epoch 50 after which a steady increase follows. In the second phase, the network overfits to the corrupted data resulting in more test error on the uncorrupted test data (Figure 6b). More importantly, the increase of the test error is due to the nuisance space as the error over information space is stable while it

increases over the nuisance. In particular the residual on  $\mathcal{N}$  slowly increases while residual on  $\mathcal{I}$  drops sharply creating a dip in both test error and total residual energy around epoch 50. This phenomenon is further explained in the appendix (see Sec. 5.1) via a linear model.

In Table 2 we again depict the fraction of the energy of the labels and the initial residual that lies on the information/nuisance spaces. The Jacobian continues to adapt to the labels/initial residual even in the presence of label corruption, albeit to a smaller degree. We note that due to corruption, labels are less correlated with the information space of the Jacobian and the fraction of the energy on the nuisance space is higher which results in worse generalization (as predicted by our theory).

To demonstrate the connection between generalization and information/nuisance spaces, we repeat the experiment with  $25\%$ ,  $75\%$  and  $100\%$  label corruption and depict the results after 800 epochs in Fig. 7. As expected, the test error increases with the corruption. Furthermore, the corrupted labels become less correlated with the information space with more of the label energy falling onto the nuisance space. This is consistent with our theory which predicts worse generalization in this case.
