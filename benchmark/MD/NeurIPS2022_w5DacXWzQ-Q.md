# Abstract

Vision Transformers (ViTs) yield impressive performance across various vision tasks. However, heavy computation and memory footprint make them inaccessible for edge devices. Previous works apply importance criteria determined independently by each individual component to prune ViTs. Considering that heterogeneous components in ViTs play distinct roles, these approaches lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce joint importance, which integrates essential structural-aware interactions between components for the first time, to perform collaborative pruning. Based on the theoretical analysis, we construct a Taylor-based approximation to evaluate the joint importance. This guides pruning toward a more balanced reduction across all components. To further reduce the algorithm complexity, we incorporate the interactions into the optimization function under some mild assumptions. Moreover, the proposed method can be seamlessly applied to various tasks including object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on ImageNet, increasing accuracy by  $0.7\%$  over the DeiT-Base baseline while saving  $50\%$  FLOPs. On COCO, we are the first to show that  $70\%$  FLOPs of Faster R-CNN with ViT backbone can be removed with only  $0.3\%$  mAP drop. Code will be made available soon.

# 1 Introduction

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated nearly every aspect of computer vision for a long time [1]. Recently, the emerging ViTs [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] have shown competitive performance on image classification, object detection, and other vision tasks. Despite the success, ViTs contain complicated submodules and require more intensive computational cost [8], limiting their deployment on resource-restricted devices. This naturally calls for compression and acceleration in ViTs as those done in CNNs.

One common direction for speeding up deep neural networks is to remove a group of less important connections that have a negligible impact on the network's performance. As pruning is proven very powerful to accelerate CNNs [9, 10, 11, 12], the exploration of pruning ViTs has just emerged. Different from CNNs whose parameters mainly rely on the homogeneous component, i.e., convolutional filter, transformers contain heterogeneous components such as multi-head self-attention (MSA), hidden neurons, and embedding neurons, as shown in Figure 1. These components play different functional roles in capturing contextual information and each one is associated with a distinct structure. This makes pruning ViTs more challenging. Many previous approaches focus on trimming either heads [13] or patches [14, 15], while neglecting the time-consuming embedding component that accounts for the majority of redundancy as shown in our analysis. Most recent works [16, 17] aim at pruning multiple components in ViTs and gain better acceleration than pruning a single

component. However, this line of methods ignores complicated interactions between components, leading to suboptimal compressed models. As pointed out by some studies [18] that worked on the interpretability of DNNs, interactions make meaningful contributions to the inference. Thus, interactions should be taken into account to minimize the impact of pruned parameters in ViTs.

In this work, we explore efficient ViTs through pruning all components comprehensively, which offers better flexibility to search for the optimal subnetwork in parameter design space and potentially reaches maximum acceleration for ViTs. Since all components collaborate with each other to achieve superior modeling capability instead of playing individually, we propose to quantitatively analyze the joint importance of the pruned components, which contains the individual importance of each component as well as the interactions between components. Although preceding approaches including OBD [19] and OBS [20] have studied the interactions in pruning CNNs, the contribution of interactions is limited in CNNs [10], which consist of homogeneous components. Nevertheless, this is not the case for ViT. In this paper, we investigate the interactions between components and demystify that interactions are crucial in heterogeneous ViTs. Specifically, we propose to exploit the Hessian matrix to capture the interactions between components. To reduce the high computational cost of the Hessian matrix and facilitate the proposed algorithm for more applications, we encode the interactions represented by the Hessian matrix into pruning ratios of different components to efficiently approximate the optimization target. Finally, the Evolutionary Algorithm [21] is leveraged to solve the optimization problem. In addition, the pruning framework can be extended to accelerate more complicated networks such as detection networks. We summarize our main contributions as follows:

- To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explicitly incorporate the interactions between different components into pruning ViTs.  
- Based on the theoretical analysis, we transform the joint importance into an approximated optimization target to prune efficiently.  
- We conduct a systematical analysis of ViTs and propose a comprehensive framework for pruning all components in ViTs by solving an optimization problem. The framework can also generalize well to more complicated networks.  
- The experimental results on various models and tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach brings great acceleration while preserving excellent performance.

# 2.1 Vision Transformers

Transformer [22] is originally designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It relies on self-attention to capture long-term dependencies and has long been a dominant preference in NLP. Recently, the pioneering work of ViT [2] has demonstrated that directly applying a pure transformer to a sequence of image patches brings exciting results on various image classification benchmarks

with large-scale pre-training. The powerful modeling capability from ViT spawns many novel vision transformer models in computer vision. DeiT [23] makes use of a bunch of training techniques and particularly proposes a distillation procedure to release the ViT from heavy dependency on large datasets, outperforming the original ViT as well. Later, PVT [24] and Swin [3] introduce the pyramid structure into transformers to generate multi-scale feature maps, making it a unified backbone for multiple downstream vision tasks. Subsequently, many vision transformers [5, 25, 3, 6, 24, 45] are presented to improve the performance and achieve astonishing results on multiple benchmarks. Until now, ViTs have been widely applied across various vision tasks, including image classification [3, 7], object detection [3, 4], segmentation [26], point cloud [27], and so on. However, the computational cost of ViTs is still intensive and scales up quickly as numbers of MSA heads, embedding width [28].

# 2.2 CNN Pruning

Extensive efforts have been conducted to prune CNNs for better efficiency via weight magnitude [29], filter norm [30], scaling factor [31], learned performance proxy [12] etc. More relevantly, some works utilize Taylor expansion to approximate the loss of pruning. OBD [19] and OBS [20] aim to prune weights with the least error approximated by second-order Taylor derivatives, which is intractable for millions of parameters in modern deep models. [32] introduces an importance metric based on first-order Taylor expansion, avoiding the expensive computation cost of the Hessian matrix. L-OBS [9] proposes a layer-wise pruning method using a criterion based on second-order derivatives of a layer-wise error function. CCP [33] analyzes the layer-wise overall impact of pruned channels based on the second-order Taylor expansion when pruning each layer. [10] measures the importance by a squared difference of prediction errors and approximates it using Taylor expansion. In experiments, they show that the Hessian matrix makes negligible improvements, which indicates that the interactions are limited in pruning CNN.

# 2.3 Transformer Pruning

Compared to pruning CNNs, pruning transformer is still in the early stage. Some previous works put efforts into pruning different substructures, including attention head [13], basic block [34]. The recent advances in ViTs motivate many works to design special methods for ViTs. Instead of training full ViTs, [8] integrates sparse training into the transformer to train the smaller subnetwork from scratch. Another line of works [14, 35, 36] extract data-related redundancy and remove unnecessary image patches. Unfortunately, pruning patches breaks down the spatial structure of ViTs. Recently, NVP [16] first shows that pruning all components reaches better acceleration. UP [17] considers KL-Divergence change for each parameter on a proxy dataset, using the same compression ratio in all blocks. ViT-Slim [37] designs differentiable soft masks on each component and imposes  $\ell_1$  sparsity constraint to force the mask to be sparse. Different from the hand-crafted pruning ratios in prior works, we first quantitatively analyze the interactions between components and adaptively learn the proper pruning ratio for each component by solving the optimization problem, offering the best flexibility to find the optimal subnetwork in a more collaborative manner.

# 3 Method

In this section, based on the relationship between computational cost and prunable ViT components, we present the scheme of pruning all components in ViTs comprehensively.

# 3.1 Components Analysis

To reveal how each component affects the computational cost of ViTs and analyze the trade-off between accuracy and FLOPs reduction for the network, we conduct experiments on pruning the commonly used DeiT. Figure 2a clearly shows that pruning a single component results in the unsatisfactory performance of pruned models. Meanwhile, each component makes distinct contributions to the network. Furthermore, we break down the computation of ViT into three parts, while ViT variants follow a similar configuration. As shown in Table 1, MSA and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) account for  $36\%$  and  $64\%$  computation respectively. Combining with the architecture characteristics illustrated by Figure 1, structural pruning can be applied to three components to accelerate ViTs: 1) Attention head, which only affects MSA computation; 2) Hidden dimension, which only affects

Table 1: Computation analysis. The last two columns gives examples of FLOPs in practical DeiT and Swin model.  $n$  is the number of patches,  ${d}_{h}$  is the feature dimension of each head.  

<table><tr><td>Part</td><td>Computation</td><td>DeiT-B</td><td>Swin-B</td></tr><tr><td>MSA Projects</td><td>3ndhdh + nhdh d</td><td>5.57G</td><td>4.91G</td></tr><tr><td>MSA attention</td><td>2n2h dh</td><td>0.72G</td><td>0.31G</td></tr><tr><td>FFN</td><td>2nddff</td><td>11.1G</td><td>9.87G</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2nhdh(2d + n) + 2nddff</td><td>17.5G</td><td>15.4G</td></tr></table>

FFN; 3) Embedding dimension, which is shared across both MSA and FFN. Despite embedding dimension being responsible for the largest amount of computation, it is more tricky to evaluate the importance of embedding dimension than other components. The reason behind this lies in that embedding dimensions of different linear layers are entangled due to skip connection. Consequently, collaboratively pruning all components needs to handle the difficulty in evaluating the importance of distinct components.

# 3.2 Collaborative Pruning

Based on the above observations, our collaborative pruning scheme adjusts all components together to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and latency. Given a ViT model, we apply structural pruning on all components by removing unnecessary parameter groups that cause a minimum performance drop on the network. The performance drop can be reflected by the perturbation in the loss function  $\mathcal{L}$ . Inspired by OBD [19], we use the Taylor expansions to construct an approximated expression of the loss function and analytically estimate the joint influence of pruning. Formally, we define collaborative pruning as a kind of perturbation  $\Delta w$  on the whole weight vector  $w$ , under a certain computational cost constraint  $C_{budget}$  (e.g. FLOPs). The optimal subnetwork can be found through the following optimization problem:

$$
\min  _ {\Delta \boldsymbol {w}} \Delta \mathcal {L} = \mathcal {L} (\boldsymbol {w} + \Delta \boldsymbol {w}) - \mathcal {L} (\boldsymbol {w}),
$$

$$
s. t. C (\boldsymbol {w} + \Delta \boldsymbol {w}) \leq C _ {\text {b u d g e t}}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $C(\boldsymbol{w} + \Delta \boldsymbol{w})$  represents the computational cost of the pruned model and  $\Delta \boldsymbol{w} = \boldsymbol{b} \odot \boldsymbol{w} - \boldsymbol{w}$ . The binary mask  $\boldsymbol{b}$  indicates whether each weight should be pruned and  $\odot$  is Hadamard product.  $\Delta \mathcal{L}$  denotes the difference of loss function before and after pruning, which can be further formulated as following:

$$
\Delta \mathcal {L} = \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {g} + \frac {1}{2} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {H} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} + O (| | \Delta \boldsymbol {w} | | ^ {3}), \tag {2}
$$

where  $\pmb{g}$  and  $\pmb{H}$  are the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix w.r.t  $\pmb{w}$ .

According to quadratic approximation [19], the third term in Equation 2 can be neglected. Generally, the first term  $\Delta \boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{g}$  measures the impact of each parameter group playing individually. As we employ structural pruning, the first term can be further rewritten as the sum over perturbation of all pruned parameter groups:

$$
\Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {g} = \sum_ {s \in S} I _ {i}. \tag {3}
$$

where  $I_{i} = \sum_{i\in s}w_{i}g_{i}$  is the individual importance for the pruned parameter group.  $S$  is the set of all prunable parameter groups.  $w_{i}, g_{i}$  is the weight and gradient for the  $i$ -th parameter respectively in the parameter group  $s$ . The  $\Delta \pmb{w}^T\pmb{g}$  can be easily computed since  $g_{i}$  is already available from backward propagation.

The second term in Equation 2 provides rich knowledge about the interactions between components, which is essential for pruning ViTs. However, the brute-force method suffers from huge memory space and computational cost required by the large-scale full Hessian matrix in Equation 2. This is infeasible on many devices and restricts the application of our method.

To tackle this problem, we propose a more efficient approximation. Due to different roles that different components play in ViT, we split all interactions encoded by the full Hessian matrix into intra-component interactions (blue, orange, yellow parts in Figure 2b) and inter-component interactions

![](images/afcb5f004d43280db995ce1283c0143493ab04207f5e1f8721437651474bed74.jpg)

(b) An example illustration of the full Hessian matrix. Green blocks indicate the interactions between components. Other blocks mean the interactions within corresponding component.

(green parts in Figure 2b). Correspondingly,  $\Delta w$  during pruning can be partitioned into weight perturbations within component of head, hidden neurons and embedding neurons  $[\Delta w^{(1)},\Delta w^{(2)},\Delta w^{(3)}]$  Substituting the partitioned weight perturbations into second term in Equation 2, we have

$$
\frac {1}{2} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {H} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} = \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {k, l = 1} ^ {3} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(k) ^ {T}} \boldsymbol {H} ^ {(k l)} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(l)}. \tag {4}
$$

Here  $H^{(kl)}$  is the Hessian block matrix describes the interactions between component  $k$  and component  $l$ . For example,  $H^{(11)}$ , illustrated by the blue block in Figure 2b, represents the interactions within heads, while the green block  $H^{(12)}$  indicates the interactions between heads and hidden neurons.

Denoting all the learnable weights belongs to component  $i$  by  $\boldsymbol{w}^{(i)}$ , we re-formulate each Hessian block in Equation 4 as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(k) ^ {T}} \boldsymbol {H} ^ {(k l)} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(l)} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N ^ {(k)}} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N ^ {(l)}} m _ {i j} ^ {(k l)} w _ {i} ^ {(k)} h _ {i j} ^ {(k l)} w _ {j} ^ {(l)} \\ = N ^ {(k)} N ^ {(l)} \overline {{\boldsymbol {M} ^ {(k l)} \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(k)} \boldsymbol {H} ^ {(k l)} \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(l)}}}, \tag {5} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $N^{(k)}, N^{(l)}$  is the total number of parameters in component  $k$  and  $l$ .  $m_{ij}^{(kl)}$  is the mask of the interaction between the  $i$ -th parameter in component  $k$  and the  $j$ -th parameter in component  $l$ .  $m_{ij}^{(kl)} = 1$  means the interaction is added into weight perturbation due to pruning of corresponding parameter and  $m_{ij}^{(kl)} = 0$  means the interaction should be neglected.  $\overline{M^{(kl)}\pmb{w}^{(k)}H^{(kl)}\pmb{w}^{(l)}}$  denotes the mean of Hessian block correspond to the pruned network.

Without loss of generality, every pruning process can be regarded as a random and independent weight sampling from the network. Thus the Hessian block can be transformed into the following expression:

$$
\Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(k)} \boldsymbol {H} ^ {(k l)} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(l)} \approx N ^ {(k)} N ^ {(l)} \overline {{\boldsymbol {M} ^ {(k l)}}} \overline {{\boldsymbol {w} ^ {(k)} \boldsymbol {H} ^ {(k l)} \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(l)}}}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\overline{M}^{(kl)}$  denotes the mean of the mask matrix,  $u^{(kl)} = \overline{\boldsymbol{w}^{(k)}\boldsymbol{H}^{(kl)}\boldsymbol{w}^{(l)}}$  is the mean of the full Hessian block matrix term. In this paper,  $u$  is computed by Monte Carlo method [38] to further reduce computational cost.

During pruning,  $\overline{M^{(kl)}}$  is generated by:

$$
\overline {{\boldsymbol {M} ^ {(k l)}}} = \overline {{\boldsymbol {b} ^ {(k)} [ \boldsymbol {b} ^ {(l)} ] ^ {T}}} = \overline {{\boldsymbol {b} ^ {(k)}}} \overline {{[ \boldsymbol {b} ^ {(l)} ] ^ {T}}}, \tag {7}
$$

$\overline{\boldsymbol{M}^{(kl)}} = \overline{\boldsymbol{b}^{(k)}[\boldsymbol{b}^{(l)}]^T} = \overline{\boldsymbol{b}^{(k)}} [\overline{\boldsymbol{b}^{(l)}]^T},$  (7)

where  $\pmb{b}^{(k)}$  denotes the binary mask vector for the  $k$ -th component and  $\overline{\pmb{b}^{(k)}}$  is identical to the pruning ratio. We define the pruning ratios of attention head, hidden, embedding by  $\rho^{(1)}, \rho^{(2)}$  and  $\rho^{(3)}$  respectively:

$$
\rho^ {(i)} = \left\| \boldsymbol {b} ^ {(i)} \right\| _ {0}, i = 1, 2, 3, \tag {8}
$$

where  $||x||_0$  is the  $\ell_0$ -norm. So  $\overline{M^{(kl)}}$  is equal to  $\rho^{(k)}\rho^{(l)}$ , and we can simplify the interactions as:

$$
\Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(k)} \boldsymbol {H} ^ {(k l)} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(l)} \approx N ^ {(k)} N ^ {(l)} \rho^ {(k)} \rho^ {(l)} u ^ {(k l)}. \tag {9}
$$

$N^{(k)} = ||\pmb{w}^{(i)}||_0$  means all parameters in component  $k$ . Therefore, the loss perturbation in Equation 2 can be approximated as:

$$
\Delta \mathcal {L} \approx \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {g} + \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {k, l = 1} ^ {3} N ^ {(k)} N ^ {(l)} u ^ {(k l)} \rho^ {(k)} \rho^ {(l)}. \tag {10}
$$

As described above, the  $\Delta w$  can be partitioned into weight perturbations along each component:  $\Delta w = [\Delta w^{(1)},\Delta w^{(2)},\Delta w^{(3)}]$ . Summarizing all above, the final objective of collaborative pruning that minimizes the joint importance can be rewritten as following:

$$
\min  _ {\rho^ {(1)}, \rho^ {(2)}, \rho^ {(3)}} \Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {g} + \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {k, l = 1} ^ {3} N ^ {(k)} N ^ {(l)} u ^ {(k l)} \rho^ {(k)} \rho^ {(l)},
$$

$$
s. t. C (\boldsymbol {w} + \Delta \boldsymbol {w}) \leq C _ {\text {b u d g e t}},
$$

$$
\Delta \boldsymbol {w} ^ {(i)} = \operatorname {P r u n e} \left(\rho^ {(i)}\right) \quad i = 1, 2, 3. \tag {11}
$$

Here Prune represents an operation to prune weights within each component individually. Specifically, for the  $i$ -th component with pruning ratio  $\rho^{(i)}$ , the Prune will update the mask of the least important  $N^{(i)}\rho^{(i)}$  weights as zero. Correspondingly, weight perturbation  $\Delta \pmb{w}^{(i)}$  becomes  $\pmb{b}^{(i)} \odot \pmb{w}^{(i)} - \pmb{w}^{(i)}$ . To evaluate the importance of each weight, we apply the Fisher information metric [11]:

$$
I _ {i} = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \frac {\partial^ {2} \mathcal {L} ^ {(n)}}{\partial w _ {i} ^ {2}} = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \left(w _ {i} \frac {\partial \mathcal {L} ^ {(n)}}{\partial w _ {i}}\right) ^ {2}. \tag {12}
$$

Finally, the whole optimization problem can be solved by Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) [21]. We provide a complete view of the collaborative pruning in the Appendix. When dealing with the more complicated detection network, we regard the neck and detection head as new components. Then collaborative pruning leverages the interactions involving all components to trim down the network.

Relations to CNN pruning methods using the Hessian matrix As described in Section 2.2, L-OBS [9] and CCP [33] leverage the second-order derivatives for pruning homogeneous CNNs. However, they both fail to deal with networks containing multiple heterogeneous components such as ViTs since the structural characteristic of each component is quite different and the importance of different components is incomparable. Simply applying them on ViTs will cause non-optimal prune ratios for different components. Furthermore, these layer-wise pruning methods discard important relationships between layers, for example, the relationship between MSA and FFN. The layer-wise design also needs to set pre-defined ratios for each layer, which is not optimal. Going beyond both, we establish the benefits of Hessian as a tool to capture the essential interactions across different components and different layers in pruning ViTs. Through solving the optimization problem, our work adaptively learns optimal pruning ratios for each component.

Implementation Details The pruning process is performed on pre-trained DeiT $^1$  released from official implementation on ImageNet-1k. As our method is a one-shot method, the whole pruning process is performed fast on a single GPU. After pruning, we fine-tune the pruned network using the same setting as DeiT [23] without warm-up.

Results We present summarized results on Table 2. On DeiT-Base, SAViT can steadily outperform previous state-of-the-art works under various complexity settings. Impressively, when reducing the model size by  $50\%$  FLOPs, SAViT achieves  $0.32\%$  improvement with  $17\%$  fewer FLOPs than  $\mathrm{S}^2\mathrm{ViTE - B}$  and even surpasses the baseline by  $0.7\%$ . When we further increase the compression ratio to  $70\%$ , our approach still obtains competitive performance with only a  $0.18\%$  accuracy drop, outperforming the recently proposed UVC by  $1.1\%$ . The strong performance indicates that SAViT benefits a lot from the interactions. On the other hand, the pruned models by our method show a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency than hand-crafted models as well as models based on Neural Architecture Search (NAS). For example, our compressed model obtains higher accuracy than T2T-ViT-24 with fewer FLOPs. A similar observation holds for DeiT-Small, where our method outperforms SSP and  $\mathrm{S}^2\mathrm{ViTE}$  by a large margin. Furthermore, the proposed method also achieves the best top-1 accuracy when pruning smaller DeiT-Tiny. The consistently remarkable performance of pruning DeiT family demonstrates the proposed collaborative pruning algorithm works very well with different model complexity, suggesting strong potential for widespread applications.

For better performance, we also investigate fine-tuning with knowledge distillation. Using DeiT-Base-Distilled as baseline, we prune it into SAViT-T with similar model size as DeiT-Tiny.

$^{1}$ https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit

Then we fine-tune the pruned models with a simple knowledge distillation strategy. The fine-tune configuration is detailed in Appendix.

Table 3 lists the results of our method and previous compression methods. As expected, assembling knowledge distillation boosts the performance of SAViT. It achieves  $77.0\%$  accuracy with only 1.3G FLOPs, substantially reducing DeiT-Base-Distilled computational cost by  $91.6\%$  FLOPs and surpassing the distillation-only DeiT

Tiny-Distilled as well as NVP-T. This means a heavily pruned model from a larger model achieves better accuracy and indicates the necessity of pruning, consistent with the previous observations [44]. Besides, SAViT substantially improves accuracy over other compression methods.

Table 3: Results of combining pruning and knowledge distillation for compressing DeiT-Base-Distilled. DeiT-T-Distilled indicates the pre-trained baseline from DeiT family [23]. UP-DeiT and NVP adopt pruning before knowledge distillation.

# 4.2 Pruning Swin Transformer

To verify the generalization of our method, we also conduct experiments on a more challenging ViT, i.e. hierarchical Swin Transformer. It adopts the local windows attention mechanism to reduce the computation cost for downstream tasks and becomes a general-purpose backbone [3, 45]. We compare our approach with baselines pruning method  $\ell_1$ -norm, which is extended from CNN compression [30] and belongs to importance-based methods.

Implementation Details Similar to DeiT, we perform pruning on official pre-trained Swin $^2$  on ImageNet-1k. Finally, we fine-tune the pruned network for 300 epochs under the same strategies as Swin [3].

Results Table 4 compares the results of our approach with the baseline pruning method. Pruning Swin is more challenging since the elabo

rately designed hierarchical architecture has better parameter efficiency and less redundancy. Our approach can reduce the computational costs by  $50\%$  with a slight influence, consistently surpassing the baseline pruning method  $\ell_1$ -norm. The impressive performance of pruning Swin Transformer again demonstrates the superiority of the proposed pruning algorithm.

Table 4: Results of pruning Swin-Base on ImageNet-1k dataset.  

<table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Method</td><td>Param.</td><td>FLOPs</td><td>Top-1 Acc.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Swin-B</td><td>Baseline</td><td>87.8M</td><td>15.4G</td><td>83.51</td></tr><tr><td>\( \ell_1 \)-norm[30]</td><td>36.0M</td><td>7.8G</td><td>80.95</td></tr><tr><td>ours</td><td>33.0M</td><td>7.7G</td><td>82.62</td></tr></table>

# 4.3 Pruning Detection Network

Since the detection network consists of more components such as the neck, it becomes harder to prune such complicated architecture. Benefiting from the collaborative optimization of our method, the proposed approach can be easily transferred to accelerate the detection network by adding the neck and detection head

as new components. We employ pruning on the popular object detection framework Faster R-CNN [46] with Swin-Tiny backbone on COCO 2017 dataset and report mean Average Precision (mAP) for comparison. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply pruning to detection networks with ViT as the backbone. Besides, we extended  $\ell_1$ -norm pruning as our baseline method for comparison.

Table 5: Pruning Faster R-CNN detection network on COCO.  

<table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Method</td><td>Param.</td><td>FLOPs.</td><td>mAP</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Faster R-CNN (Swin-T)</td><td>Baseline</td><td>45.2M</td><td>221.7G</td><td>45.5</td></tr><tr><td>\( \ell_1 \)-norm[30]</td><td>21.7M</td><td>67.8G</td><td>42.1</td></tr><tr><td>ours</td><td>19.2M</td><td>67.8G</td><td>45.2</td></tr></table>

As noticed in Table 5, when targeting a considerable compression ratio (i.e.  $58\%$  parameters and  $70\%$  FLOPs reduction), our approach only has a slight mAP drop, outperforming the  $\ell_1$ -norm by a large margin, e.g.  $3.1\%$  mAP. This indicates that the proposed method can capture the interactions between multiple components in a more complicated network and excavate the redundancy well.

# 4.4 Ablation Study

Latency Measurement We strictly measure the latency of compressed ViTs using CUDA benchmark mode, please see Appendix for details. Table 6 shows that the proposed method can bring  $0.7\%$  accuracy gains when compressing the DeiT-Base to achieve  $2.0 \times$  FLOPs reduction and  $1.55 \times$  inference speedup. More significantly, a larger  $2.05 \times$  inference speedup of DeiT-Base can be obtained with merely  $0.18\%$  loss of accuracy. These observations suggest that our method can prune ViTs for better latency in practical applications.

Table 6: Run time speedup of compressed DeiT on Nvidia V100.  

<table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Param (×).</td><td>FLOPs (×)</td><td>Speedup (×)</td><td>Top-1 Acc.(%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">DeiT-Base</td><td>86.6M (1.00)</td><td>17.6G (1.00)</td><td>1.00</td><td>81.84</td></tr><tr><td>42.6M (2.03)</td><td>8.8G (2.00)</td><td>1.55</td><td>82.54</td></tr><tr><td>25.4M (3.41)</td><td>5.3G (3.32)</td><td>2.05</td><td>81.66</td></tr></table>

The Impact of Interactions An appealing feature of our method is the consideration of interactions between components, which helps identify redundancy accurately. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we prune DeiT-Base and Faster R-CNN according to the optimization function with and without second-order interactions under the same acceleration target, i.e.  $70\%$  FLOPs reduction. For DeiT-Base, we fine-tune the pruned models for 80 epochs following the identical setting in Section 4.1. For Faster R-CNN, the pruned model is fine-tuned using the same setting as Section 4.3. Table 7 clearly shows that optimizing individual importance and interactions together gives the best result. Moreover, we observe that interactions help adjust all components toward a more balanced architecture. These observations suggest that interactions indeed play an important role in identifying structural redundancy and can boost the performance of the pruned model.

# 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a versatile ViT accelerating framework that collaboratively prunes all components. Based on the theoretical analysis, we construct a Taylor-based optimization function to take full advantage of the interactions between heterogeneous components. As the Hessian matrix requires huge computation cost, we derive an approximation to transform the Hessian matrix into pruning ratios and achieve fast pruning. Then the optimization problem is solved towards the optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. We also show the proposed framework can be applied to prune more complicated architecture e.g., detection network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces computational cost without compromising performance on various models as well as tasks.
