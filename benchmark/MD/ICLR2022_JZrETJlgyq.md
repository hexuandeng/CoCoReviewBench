# ABSTRACT

Existing deep clustering methods rely on contrastive learning for representation learning, which requires negative examples to form an embedding space where all instances are well-separated. However, the negative examples inevitably give rise to the class collision issue, compromising the representation learning for clustering. In this paper, we explore the non-contrastive representation learning for deep clustering, termed NCC, which is based on BYOL, a representative method without negative examples. First, we propose a positive sampling strategy to align one augmented view of instance with the neighbors of another view so that we can avoid the class collision issue caused by the negative examples and hence improve the within-cluster compactness. Second, we propose a novel prototypical contrastive loss, ProtoCL, which can encourage prototypical alignment between two augmented views and prototypical uniformity, hence maximizing the inter-cluster distance. Moreover, we formulate NCC in an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, in which E-step utilizes spherical k-means to estimate the pseudolabels of instances and distribution of prototypes from the target network and M-step leverages the proposed losses to optimize the online network. As a result, NCC is able to form an embedding space where all clusters are well-separated and within-cluster examples are compact. Experimental results on several clustering benchmark datasets as well as ImageNet-1K demonstrate that the proposed NCC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep clustering is gaining considerable attention as it can learn representation of images and perform clustering in an end-to-end fashion. Remarkably, contrastive learning-based methods (Wang et al., 2021; Van Gansbeke et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021a;b; Tao et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2021; Niu & Wang, 2021) have become the main thrust to advance the representation of images on several complex benchmark datasets, significantly contributing to the clustering performance. In addition, some contrastive learning methods such as MoCo (He et al., 2020) and SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) usually require specially designed losses (Wang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021a;b; Tao et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2021) or an extra pre-training stage for more discriminative representations (Van Gansbeke et al., 2020; Niu & Wang, 2021).

Although achieving promising clustering results, contrastive learning requires a large number of negative examples to achieve the instance-wise discrimination in an embedding space where all instances are well-separated. The constructed negative pairs usually require a large batch size (Chen et al., 2020), memory queue (He et al., 2020), or memory bank (Wu et al., 2018), which not only bring extra computational cost but also give rise to class collision issue (Saunshi et al., 2019). Here, class collision issue refers to that the different instances from the same semantic class are regarded as the negative pairs, hurting the representation learning for clustering. A question naturally arises: are negative examples necessary for deep clustering?

Another kind of self-supervised learning is the non-contrastive methods such as BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) and SimSiam (Chen & He, 2021), which use the representations of one augmented view to predict another view. Their success demonstrates that negative examples are not the key to avoiding representation collapse. However, to the best of our knowledge, almost all recent successful literature of deep clustering is built upon contrastive learning-based methods such as MoCo (He et al.,

2020) and SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020). There is a general consensus that the negative examples are helpful to stabilize the training of representation learning for deep clustering. As discussed in (Wang & Isola, 2020), the typical contrastive loss can be identified into two properties: 1) alignment term to improve the closeness of positive pairs; and 2) uniformity term to encourage instances to be uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere. In contrast, non-contrastive methods such as BYOL only optimize the alignment term, leading to unstable training and suffering from the representation collapse—which may be worsen when adding extra losses.

To tackle the class collision issue, we explore the non-contrastive representation learning for deep clustering, termed non-contrastive clustering or NCC, which is based on BYOL, a representative method without negative examples. First, instead of negative sampling that is a double-edged sword, i.e., causing class collision issue but improving the training stability, we propose a positive sampling strategy to align one augmented view of the instance with the neighbors of another view so that we can avoid the class collision issue and hence improve the within-cluster compactness. Second, as for the clustering task, the different clusters are truly negative pairs for contrastive loss. To this end, we propose a novel prototypical contrastive loss, ProtoCL, which can encourage prototypical alignment between two augmented views and prototypical uniformity—maximizing the inter-cluster distance. Moreover, we formulate our method into a unified EM framework, in which we iteratively perform E-step as estimating the pseudo-labels of instances and distribution of prototypes via spherical k-means based on the target network and M-step as optimizing the online network via the proposed losses. As a result, NCC is able to form an embedding space where all clusters are well-separated and within-cluster examples are compact. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

- We explore the non-contrastive representation learning for deep clustering, called non-contrastive clustering or NCC, which is based on the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL), a representative method without negative examples.  
- We propose a positive sampling strategy to augment instance alignment by taking into account neighbor positive examples, which can avoid the class collision issue and hence improve the within-cluster compactness.  
- We propose a novel prototypical contrastive loss or ProtoCL, which can align the cluster assignment of one augmented view to another view and make the clusters uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere, hence maximizing the inter-cluster distance.  
- We formulate our method into an EM framework, in which we can iteratively estimate the pseudolabels and distribution of prototypes via spherical k-means based on the target network and optimize the online network via the proposed losses.  
- Extensively experimental results on several benchmark datasets as well as ImageNet-1K demonstrate that NCC outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Self-supervised learning. Previous self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for representation learning attempt to capture the data distribution using generative models (Donahue et al., 2017; Donahue & Simonyan, 2019) or learn the representations through some special designed pretext tasks (Doersch et al., 2015; Noroozi & Favaro, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Caron et al., 2018). In recent years, contrastive learning methods (Wu et al., 2018; He et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) have shown promising results for both representation learning and downstream tasks. For example, MoCo (He et al., 2020) uses a memory queue to store the consistent representations output by a moving-averaged encoder. However, the class collision issue remains unavoidable; i.e., the semantic similar instances are pushed away since they could be regarded as negative pairs (Saunshi et al., 2019). Some attempts have been made to address this issue (Khosla et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021; Chuang et al., 2020). On the contrary, the recent studies of SSL demonstrate that the negative examples are not necessary, termed non-contrastive methods (Caron et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020). In summary, SSL methods mainly focus on inducing transferable representations for the downstream tasks instead of grouping the data into different semantic classes in deep clustering.

Deep clustering. Deep clustering can be significantly advanced by discriminative representations. Examples of traditional deep clustering methods include: Xie et al. (2016); Yang et al. (2017) use autoencoders to simultaneously perform representation learning and clustering; Chang et al. (2017);

Haeusser et al. (2018); Wu et al. (2019); Ji et al. (2019) learn pair-wise relationships among original and augmented instances. However, they often suffer from inferior performance on some complex datasets such as CIFAR-20. Inspired by the success of contrastive learning, recent studies turn to exploit the discriminative representations learned from contrastive learning to assist the downstream clustering tasks (Van Gansbeke et al., 2020; Niu & Wang, 2021) or simultaneously optimize representation learning and clustering (Tao et al., 2021; Tsai et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021a; Shen et al., 2021). SCAN (Van Gansbeke et al., 2020) uses the model pre-trained by SimCLR to yield the confident pseudo-labels. IDFD (Tao et al., 2021) proposes to perform both instance discrimination and feature decorrelation. All of them are built upon the contrastive learning framework, which means that they require a large number of negative examples for training stability, inevitably giving rise to class collision issue. Different from prior work, this paper explores the non-contrastive self-supervised methods, i.e., BYOL, to achieve both representation learning and clustering. We note that Regatti et al. (2021); Lee et al. (2020) have tried to build the clustering framework based on BYOL, however, their methods did not consider improving within-cluster compactness and maximizing inter-cluster distance like ours. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that introduces the non-contrastive methods into deep clustering that yields a substantial performance improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.

# 3 METHODOLOGY

# 3.1 PRELIMINARY

The most successful self-supervised learning methods in recent years can be roughly divided into contrastive (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020) and non-contrastive (Grill et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2021). Here, we briefly summarize their formulas and discuss their difference.

Contrastive learning. Contrastive learning methods perform instance-wise discrimination (Wu et al., 2018) using the InfoNCE loss (Oord et al., 2018). Formally, assume that we have one instance  $\mathbf{x}$ , its augmented version  $\mathbf{x}^{+}$  by using random data augmentation, and a set of  $M$  negative examples drawn from the dataset,  $\{x_{1}^{-}, x_{2}^{-}, \ldots, x_{M}^{-}\}$ . The contrastive learning aims to learn an embedding function  $f$  that maps  $\mathbf{x}$  onto a unit hypersphere, in which the InfoNCE loss can be defined as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {c o n t r}} = - \log \frac {\exp (f (\boldsymbol {x}) ^ {\mathrm {T}} f (\boldsymbol {x} ^ {+}) / \tau)}{\exp (f (\boldsymbol {x}) ^ {\mathrm {T}} f (\boldsymbol {x} ^ {+}) / \tau) + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} \exp (f (\boldsymbol {x}) ^ {\mathrm {T}} f (\boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {-}) / \tau)} (1) \\ \approx \underbrace {- f (\boldsymbol {x}) ^ {\mathrm {T}} f \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {+}\right) / \tau} _ {\text {a l i g n m e n t}} + \underbrace {\log \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} \exp \left(f (\boldsymbol {x}) ^ {\mathrm {T}} f \left(\boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {-}\right) / \tau\right)} _ {\text {u n i f o r m i t y}}. (2) \\ \end{array}
$$

Here, we assume that the output of  $f(\cdot)$  is  $\ell_2$  normalized. That is, the representation is on a unit hypersphere. The temperature  $\tau$  controls the concentration level of representations; please refer to (Wang & Liu, 2021) for detailed behaviors of  $\tau$  in the contrastive loss. Intuitively, the InfoNCE loss aims to pull together the positive pair  $(\pmb{x},\pmb{x}^{+})$  from two different data augmentations of the same instance, and push  $\pmb{x}$  away from  $M$  negative examples of other instances. As discussed in (Wang & Isola, 2020), when  $M \to \infty$ , the InfoNCE loss in Eq. (1) can be approximately decoupled into two terms: alignment and uniformity, as shown in Eq. (2). Despite the alignment term closes the positive pair, the key to avoiding representation collapse is the uniformity term, which makes the negative examples uniformly distributed on the hypersphere. Although beneficial, the negative examples inevitably lead to the class collision issue, hurting the representation learning for clustering.

Non-contrastive learning. Non-contrastive learning-based methods have shown more promising results than contrastive learning for representation learning and downstream tasks (Ericsson et al., 2021). Non-contrastive methods only optimize the alignment term in Eq. (2) to match the representations between two augmented views. Without negative examples, they leverage an online and a target network for two views, and use a predictor network to bridge the gap between these two views. They also stop the gradient of the target network to avoid the representation collapse. In particular, if  $\tau = 0.5$ , the loss used in (Grill et al., 2020; Chen & He, 2021) can be written as:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {n o n - c o n t r}} = - 2 g (f (\boldsymbol {x})) ^ {\mathrm {T}} f ^ {\prime} \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {+}\right) = \left\| g (f (\boldsymbol {x})) - f ^ {\prime} \left(\boldsymbol {x} ^ {+}\right) \right\| _ {2} ^ {2} + \text {c o n s t}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $g$  the predictor;  $f$  and  $f'$  are the online and target networks, respectively; the outputs of  $g(f(\cdot))$  and  $f'(\cdot)$  are  $\ell_2$ -normalized. However, as mentioned in (Fetterman & Albrecht, 2020),

the non-contrastive learning methods often suffer from unstable training and highly rely on the batch-statistics and hyper-parameter tuning to avoid representation collapse. Even though Grill et al. (2020); Richemond et al. (2020) have proposed to use some tricks such as SyncBN (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) and weight normalization (Qiao et al., 2019) to alleviate this issue, the additional computation cost is significant. Without negative examples, the collapse issue could be worsen when adding extra losses; e.g., additional clustering losses for clustering task.

In a nutshell, most of existing successful deep clustering methods are based on contrastive learning for representation learning—giving rise to class collision issue—while the non-contrastive learning, due to unstable training with additional losses, is not yet ready for deep clustering. To that end, we explore the non-contrastive learning, i.e. BYOL, for deep clustering with positive sampling strategy and prototypical contrastive loss to avoid the class collision issue, improve the within-cluster compactness, and maximize the inter-class distance.

# 3.2 POSITIVE SAMPLING STRATEGY

(c) Prototypical Contrastive Loss

The negative examples are essential for contrastive learning-based deep clustering to stabilize the training of representation learning, at the cost of inevitable class collision issue (Saunshi et al., 2019). Fig. 1(a) depicts the negative sampling for contrastive learning. This issue can hurt the representation learning for clustering as the instances from the same class/cluster—should be close to each other—could be treated as negative pairs and are pulled away during training, discouraging the within-cluster compactness.

To address the class collision issue, we resort to non-contrastive learning-based methods for representation learning, which no longer need negative examples. Although we cannot optimize the uniformity term like contrastive loss, our idea is to optimize the opposite of the uniformity instead. That is, we aim to encourage the neighbor examples around one augmented view to be aligned with another view, as presented in Fig. 1(b). Our idea is that although we cannot guarantee the negative examples in contrastive loss are from different classes, we can certainly assume that the neighbor examples around one view are positive with respect to another view and belong to the same class. Therefore, we propose a positive sampling strategy to augment the instance alignment in Eq. (3) by taking into account the neighbor samples towards within-cluster compactness.

Specifically, we model the representation of one augmented view of an instance as a Gaussian distribution in the embedding space, which can be formulated as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol {v} \sim \mathcal {N} (f (\boldsymbol {x}), \sigma^ {2} \boldsymbol {I}), \tag {4}
$$

where  $I$  represents the identity matrix and  $\sigma$  is a positive hyperparameter controlling how many samples around one view can be treated as positive pairs with another view. However, the sampled examples from Eq. (4) cannot allow the error to be backpropagated through the network to update the network parameters. We employ the reparametrization trick (Kingma & Welling, 2013) to achieve

the backpropagation. As a result, the positive sampling strategy can be implemented as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol {v} = f (\boldsymbol {x}) + \sigma \boldsymbol {\epsilon}, \quad \boldsymbol {\epsilon} \sim \mathcal {N} (0, I). \tag {5}
$$

Therefore, we can augment the instance alignment in Eq. (3) by taking into account the neighbor samples to encourage the within-cluster compactness. To be simplified, we only sample one example from the Gaussian distribution to compute the instance alignment. Formally, the augmented instance alignment term can be defined as:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {a u g － i n s}} = \left\| g (f (\boldsymbol {x}) + \sigma \epsilon) - f ^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {x} ^ {+}) \right\| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {6}
$$

The benefits of the proposed positive sampling are summarized as follows.

Improved within-cluster compactness. The conventional instance alignment in Eq. (3) only encourages the representation of one augmented view to be close to another view. In the context of clustering, such compactness is instance-wise and neutral for the clustering. In other words, all instances are treated as cluster centers and the semantic structures of data distribution cannot be captured at only instance level. In contrast, our augmented instance alignment in Eq. (6) encourages the neighbor examples around one augmented view—either different augmented examples of the same instance or same/different augmented examples of different instances within the same cluster—to be positive pairs with another view. This is helpful to improve within-cluster compactness.

Avoidable class collision issue. As we mentioned before, class collision issue induced by the negative examples indicates that we cannot guarantee that the negative examples are from different clusters. However, our positive sampling strategy can guarantee that the positive examples around one instance are from the same cluster as the instance, getting rid of class collision issue. We note that our positive sampling strategy does not consider uniformity, which is solved by the proposed prototypical contrastive loss introduced in the following subsection.

# 3.3 PROTOTYPICAL CONTRASTIVE LOSS

A good clustering is supposed to have distinct semantic prototypes/clusters. Assume that the dataset has  $K$  clusters, where  $K$  is a predefined hyperparameter, it naturally constructs a contrastive loss for these  $K$  prototypes as for one prototype, the remaining  $K - 1$  prototypes are definitely negative examples. Therefore, we propose a prototypical contrastive loss or ProtoCL, which encourages the prototypical alignment between two augmented views and the prototypical uniformity, hence maximizing the inter-cluster distance.

Specifically, assume we have  $K$  prototypes from the online network,  $\{\pmb {\mu}_1,\pmb {\mu}_2,\dots ,\pmb {\mu}_K\}$ , and another  $K$  prototypes from the target network,  $\{\pmb {\mu}_1^{\prime},\pmb {\mu}_2^{\prime},\dots ,\pmb {\mu}_K^{\prime}\}$ , our proposed ProtoCL, illustrated in Fig. 1(c), is given as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {p c l}} = \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} - \log \frac {\exp \left(\boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} ^ {\mathrm {T}} \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} ^ {\prime} / \tau\right)}{\exp \left(\boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} ^ {\mathrm {T}} \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} ^ {\prime} / \tau\right) + \sum_ {j = 1 , j \neq k} ^ {K} \exp \left(\boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} ^ {\mathrm {T}} \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {j} / \tau\right)}, (7) \\ \approx \underbrace {\frac {1}{K} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} ^ {\mathrm {T}} \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} ^ {\prime} / \tau} _ {\text {p r o t o t y p i c a l a l g i n n e m t}} + \underbrace {\frac {1}{K} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \log \sum_ {j = 1 , j \neq k} ^ {K} \exp \left(\boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} ^ {\mathrm {T}} \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {j} / \tau\right)} _ {\text {p r o t o t y p i c a l u n i f o r m i t y}}. (8) \\ \end{array}
$$

Here, the cluster center  $\pmb{\mu}_k$  and  $\pmb{\mu}_k^{\prime}$  is computed within mini-batch  $\mathcal{B}$  as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} = \frac {\sum_ {\boldsymbol {x} \in \mathcal {B}} p (k | \boldsymbol {x}) f (\boldsymbol {x})}{\| \sum_ {\boldsymbol {x} \in \mathcal {B}} p (k | \boldsymbol {x}) f (\boldsymbol {x}) \| _ {2}} \quad \text {a n d} \quad \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {k} ^ {\prime} = \frac {\sum_ {\boldsymbol {x} \in \mathcal {B}} p (k | \boldsymbol {x}) f ^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {x})}{\| \sum_ {\boldsymbol {x} \in \mathcal {B}} p (k | \boldsymbol {x}) f ^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {x}) \| _ {2}}, \tag {9}
$$

and  $p(k|x)$  is the cluster assignment posterior probability given in Sec. 3.4. When  $K > |\mathcal{B}|$ , it is obvious that the mini-batch cannot cover all clusters. To this end, we zero out the losses and logits of empty clusters for each iteration; see the pseudocode in Appendix C for more details.

Clearly, our ProtoCL is quite similar to conventional contrastive loss in Eq. (1) but for prototypes with non-contrastive representation learning framework. The prototypical alignment is to align the prototypes derived from the online network with the ones from the target network, which can stabilize the update of the prototypes. The prototypical uniformity is to encourage the prototypes to be uniformly distributed on a unit hypersphere, which can maximize the inter-cluster distance.

Relation to ProtoNCE. Li et al. (2021a) proposed ProtoNCE, which is a combination of instance-level contrastive loss and instance-to-prototypes contrastive loss; the former is to encourage the uniformity while the latter one the within-cluster compactness. However, the involved negative examples cannot avoid the class collision issue, compromising the clustering performance. Different from ProtoNCE, our ProtoCL directly encourage the uniformity across clusters and alignment between two augmented views towards the goodness of clustering.

# 3.4 EM FRAMEWORK

![](images/9082f9b0e1642c0db1123e5bfb7ac3b63fde092661d3c0220a17c8f5f33c0500.jpg)  
Figure 2: The overall framework of the proposed NCC in an EM framework.

We formulate our NCC into an EM framework, detailed in Fig. 2 and derived in Appendix A.

E-step. This step aims to estimate  $p(k|x)$ . We perform spherical k-means algorithm on the features extracted from the target network since the target network performs more stable and yields more consistent clusters, similar to BYOL and MoCo. Although we need an additional k-means clustering to obtain the cluster pseudo-labels  $p(k|x)$  for every  $r$  epochs, we found that even with a larger  $r$ , rather than every epoch  $r = 1$ , our method can still produce consistent performance improvement over the baseline methods. Therefore, our method will not introduce much computation cost and is robust to the cluster pseudo-labels; see detailed results in Fig. A1. The analysis of computational cost is discussed in Appendix B. Finally, with  $p(k|x)$ , we build the cluster centers without additional memory according to Eq. (9).

M-step. As hypothesized by SimSiam (Chen & He, 2021), instance alignment loss can be seen as an EM-like algorithm. Therefore, combining the augmented instance alignment loss in Eq. (6) and the proposed ProtoCL in Eq. (7) yields our objective function as follows:

$$
\mathcal {L} = \mathcal {L} _ {\text {a u g － i n s}} + \lambda_ {\mathrm {p c l}} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {p c l}}, \tag {10}
$$

where  $\lambda_{\mathrm{pcl}}$  controls the balance between two loss components. Therefore, there are only two additional hyper-parameters compared to original BYOL, including:  $\sigma$  in  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{aug - ins}}$  and the loss weight  $\lambda_{\mathrm{pcl}}$ ; see detailed results of these two hyper-parameters in Figs. A2 and A3.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We conducted experiments on six benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), CIFAR20 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), STL10 (Coates et al., 2011), ImageNet10 (Chang et al., 2017), ImageNetDogs (Chang et al., 2017), and ImageNet

1K (Deng et al., 2009), which are summarized in Table 1. We note that CIFAR-20 contains 20 superclasses of CIFAR-100. This paper follows the experimental settings widely used in deep clustering work (Chang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019; Ji et al., 2019; Tsai et al., 2021; Tao et al.,

2021), including the image size, backbone and train-test split. We employ three common metrics to evaluate the clustering performance, including Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Cluster Accuracy (ACC), and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) for the former five dataset. Following (Li et al., 2021a), we report Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) to evaluate the clustering performance for ImageNet-1K. The results are presented in percentage (\%), and the higher the better clustering performance. For fair comparisons, we use ResNet-34 (He et al., 2016) as the backbone to report the results in Table 2. Unless noted otherwise, we use ResNet-18 for the rest of experiments. We run each experiment three times and report the mean and standard deviation as the final results. We provided detailed training settings in Appendix B. We also provide the pseudocode of NCC for better understanding in Appendix C. The source code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

(2020),  
2 CC uses a large image size (224) for all datasets.  
3 SCAN needs an additional pre-training stage while NCC is trained in an end to end manner. It only uses training set for all datasets.

Quantitative results We compared NCC with previous state-of-the-art clustering methods in Table 2. NCC achieves significant performance improvement on all five benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superior ability of NCC for deep clustering to capture the semantic structures of the dataset. Interestingly, directly using the representations learned by BYOL for k-means clustering outperforms previous work including the contrastive-based ones (Li et al., 2021b; Tsai et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2021), which suggests a great potential for non-contrastive representation learning for deep clustering without suffering class collision issue.

On the ImageNet-10, our NCC achieves competitive performance as compared to IDFD (Tao et al., 2021) since this dataset is relatively small with only 13K images, which cannot arise discriminative differences for current state-of-the-art methods. On the ImageNet-Dogs, a fine-grained dataset containing different species of dogs from the ImageNet dataset, there are almost  $20\%$  improvements over previous SOTA work. The contrastive-based methods cannot handle this kind of dataset due to severe class collision issue that pushes away the instances from the same class. Meanwhile, IDFD can deal with this problem to some degree thanks to the feature decorrelation along with the instance discrimination. Without the need of negative examples, BYOL can achieve significant improvement, although its performance is unstable. Our NCC, built upon BYOL with a positive sampling strategy and prototypical contrastive loss, has shown its significant and stable performance against vanilla BYOL and contrastive-based methods.

Table 3 further presents the results between our NCC and baseline methods including DeepCluster (Caron et al., 2018), MoCo (He et al., 2020), and PCL (Li et al., 2021a) on ImageNet-1K dataset, showing that NCC achieves significantly higher AMI score.

Although we employed the fair conditions, some work has trained the network with different split (Van Gansbeke et al., 2020) for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-20, or large image size (Li et al., 2021b) for ImageNet-10 and ImageNet-Dogs. For the sake of fair comparisons with different

image sizes and splits, we report these comparison results in Table A1. We also conducted additional experiments in Table A2 to demonstrate the ability of NCC handling the long-tailed datasets.

Qualitative results. Fig. 3 visualizes the learned representations by t-SNE (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) for four different training epochs throughout the training process. At the beginning, the random-initialized model cannot distinguish the instances from different semantic classes, where all instances are mixed together. As the training process goes, NCC gradually attracts the instances from the same cluster while pushing the clusters away from each other. Obviously, at the end of the training, NCC produces clear boundary between clusters and within-cluster compactness. Visualization for the outlier points produced by the model at 1000-th epoch is shown in Fig. A4.

# 4.2 ABLATION STUDY

Here, we perform detailed ablation studies with both quantitative and qualitative comparisons to provide more insights into why NCC performs so well for deep clustering.

Quantitative ablation study. We report the quantitative results of ablation studies in Table 4. BYOL outperforms MoCo v2 and SimSiam by a large margin on both two datasets. The difference between BYOL and MoCo v2 is that MoCo v2 uses a memory queue to store the consistent negative examples while BYOL directly aligns two augmented views with a predictor network. Different from the BYOL that employs a momentum-updated network as the target network to yield the positive representations, SimSiam shares the weights of the target and online networks. There-

fore, BYOL outperforms MoCo v2 by dealing with the class collision issue and SimSiam by the momentum-updated target network.

Compared to vanilla BYOL, simply using the positive sampling strategy can stable and further improve the performance, especially when the number of semantic classes increases for CIFAR-20. Although ProtoCL improves the baseline results by a large margin, positive sampling can further boost the clustering performance. This is because ProtoCL only considers inter-cluster distance, and cannot benefit within-cluster compactness. Therefore, the combination of the positive sampling and ProtoCL achieves the best clustering results, where positive sampling strategy can improve the within-cluster compactness and ProtoCL encourages the prototypical alignment between two augmented views and maximizes the inter-cluster distance.

To further explore the effect of the proposed ProtoCL, we split this loss function into prototypical alignment and uniformity as shown in Eq. (8). The original ProtoCL includes both alignment and uniformity terms. It is clear that the performance gain from the alignment term is marginal while the gain from the uniformity term is significant. Note that for only alignment term, we compute the loss after predictor network instead of feature extractor, otherwise representation collapse will turn out. This indicates that prototypical uniformity is more important than prototypical alignment since BYOL has already performed instance alignment at an augmented instance level. However, we note that the prototypical alignment term is essential to stabilize the training process, as demonstrated in the results for CIFAR-20 with more clusters.

Qualitative ablation study. Fig. 4 visualizes the distribution of representations learned from MoCo v2, BYOL, NCC w/o ProtoCL, and NCC. The representations from MoCo v2 are mixed up at the center due to the class collision issue. The rest of the three methods can reduce this phenomenon where NCC w/o ProtoCL produces more compact clusters than BYOL, and NCC further maintains distinct borders between different clusters.

d) NCC  $(\mathsf{NMI} = 85.5\%)$

Additional ablation studies. To explore the influences of different hyper-parameters in NCC, we perform the following ablation studies: 1) performing k-means clustering for every  $r$  epochs in Fig. A1; 2)  $\sigma$  in positive sampling in Fig. A2; 3)  $\lambda_{\mathrm{pcl}}$  for ProtoCL in Fig. A3; 4) predefined number of clusters  $K$  in Fig. A5; 5) projection dimension for self-supervised learning in Fig. A6; 6) data augmentation in Fig. A7 for self-supervised learning; and 7) different ResNet architectures in Table A3. All ablation study results verify that the performance gain of NCC does not come from backbone, projection dimension, or any other hyper-parameters. The results also suggest that NCC is robust to the choice of hyper-parameters.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We have explored the non-contrastive representation learning for deep clustering. The proposed positive sampling strategy and prototypical contrastive loss can lead to within-cluster compactness and well-separated clusters towards the goodness of clustering. The results suggest that the proposed NCC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. We hope our study will attract the community's attention to the non-contrastive representation learning methods for deep clustering, which do not suffer from class collision issue.
