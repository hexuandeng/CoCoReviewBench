# Abstract

Building models that comply with the invariances inherent to different domains, such as invariance under translation or rotation, is a key aspect of applying machine learning to real world problems like molecular property prediction, medical imaging, protein folding or LiDAR classification. For the first time, we study how the invariances of a model can be leveraged to provably guarantee the robustness of its predictions. We propose a gray-box approach, enhancing the powerful black-box randomized smoothing technique with white-box knowledge about invariances. First, we develop a post-processing-based gray-box certification procedure that can be applied to arbitrary models with invariance under permutation and Euclidean isometries. Then, we derive provably tight gray-box certificates. We experimentally demonstrate that the provably tight certificates can offer much stronger guarantees, but that in practical scenarios the post-processing method is a good approximation.

# 1 Introduction

It is well-established that machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks [1-4]. Even without malevolent actors, adversarial attacks can be considered worst case scenarios in environments with noisy, erroneous or otherwise corrupted data, thus necessitating robust machine learning methods.

Invariance is a central design principle that has so far received little dedicated attention in the realm of adversarially robust machine learning. Over the past decades, there has been ongoing research into developing machine learning models that comply with the invariances inherent to different data types and tasks. Prominent recent examples include Deep Sets [5], PointNet [6], Group Equivariant CNNs [7], Spherical CNNs [8] and Graph Convolutional Networks [9], but the study of invariant models significantly precedes the surge in popularity of deep learning methods [10-16].

For the first time, we explore the following question: Can a-priori knowledge about invariances be leveraged in deriving provable guarantees for a model's robustness to adversarial attacks?

25 Going by a loose categorization of prior work, we could adopt one of two possible approaches for our   
26 exploration: A white-box or black-box one. White-box certificates (e.g. [17-24]) analyze a model's   
27 internals, such at its weights and non-linearities, to provably guarantee that a prediction does not   
28 change under adversarial attack. Black box certificates - specifically randomized smoothing [25-27]   
29 - use statistical methods to provide provable guarantees that hold for all models sharing the same   
30 prediction probabilities under a random input distribution, irrespective of their internals.

We opt for a randomized smoothing approach, as it allows us to focus on the interplay between invariances and robustness, rather than the specific means of implementing these invariances. Based on this decision, we can define a more specific goal: Combining white-box knowledge about invariances with black-box knowledge about prediction probabilities to derive gray-box certificates.

For our exploration, we focus on models operating on spatial data, rather than structured data (e.g. images and sequences) – both because spatial symmetries can be elegantly formalized using algebraic

concepts and because there is an ongoing trend towards using machine learning for real-world applications with inherent spatial invariances, e.g. molecular property prediction [28-32], LiDAR classification [33-36], drug discovery [37-39], particle physics [40-42] and protein folding [43-47].

Our main contributions are

- a principled method for deriving tight invariance-aware randomized smoothing certificates,  
- a tight certificate for models invariant to translations in arbitrary dimensions,  
- tight certificates for models invariant to rotations in 2D and elemental rotations in 3D.

We further prove that smoothing with isotropic Gaussian noise preserves invariance to permutation and Euclidean isometries, allowing the classic randomized smoothing certificate of Cohen et al. [27] to be augmented via a post-processing approach. We experimentally demonstrate that it offers a good approximation of our tight certificates, if the variance of the smoothing distribution is small.

Invariant machine learning. Given the diversity of approaches to invariant machine learning, and the fact that our approach is model-agnostic, we refrain from attempting a survey and instead refer to [48] for a principled, high-level introduction into the realm of learning with invariances and equivariances.

Invariance and robustness. Two recent empirical studies [49, 50] demonstrate that data augmentation meant to increase robustness to  $l_{p}$ -norm adversarial attacks reduces robustness to semantically meaningful transformations (e.g. rotation) and vice-versa, suggesting an inherent invariance-robustness trade-off. However, neither studies models that are invariant by design. In [51], the negative effect of shift-invariance on the robustness of image classifiers is investigated. Note that our work is not meant to resolve potential trade-offs, but to tightly bound the actual robustness of models.

Gray-box robustness certificates. While we propose the first gray-box certificate for invariant models, there exists prior work on combining other white-box knowledge with black-box certificates. In [52] and [53], knowledge about a classifier's gradients is used to derive tighter randomized smoothing certificates. In [54], knowledge about a graph neural network's receptive fields is combined with randomized smoothing to derive collective robustness certificates for multiple predictions.

Adversarial attacks on spatial data. Adversarial attacks on spatial data have been extensively studied, in particular for point cloud classification. One can differentiate between attacks that modify [55-63], insert [62, 64, 65] or delete [66-68] coordinates. Like in other domains, empirical defenses have been proposed [56, 69, 70] and subsequently broken [71-73], motivating the development of black-box [74-76] and white-box [77] robustness certificates for spatial data. It should be noted that Gaussian randomized smoothing, without invariance information, has already been used in prior work - either as a baseline [74] or as a special case of the respective certificate [76].

Orthogonal research directions. One related but orthogonal research direction is transformation-specific certification [24, 76-82]. There, a model is assumed to potentially change its prediction under adversarial parametric transformations (e.g. rotations) and one derives provable robustness guarantees for specific parameter ranges. Here, on the other hand, we assume our model to be invariant under a set of transformations, i.e. never change its prediction, and use this property for certification. Aside from that, there exist white-box certification techniques for specific operations with invariances (global max-pooling [77], message passing [83, 84] and batch normalization [85]). Prior work treats these operations as coincidental building blocks of the models it is trying to certify. It does not study invariance itself and how to leverage it for robustness certification.

# 3 Background on randomized smoothing

Randomized smoothing is a black-box certification technique that can be adapted to various data types, tasks and threat models [86-95]. Instead of directly certifying a classifier  $g$ , it constructs a smoothed classifier  $f$  that returns the most likely prediction under random perturbations of its input. It then certifies the robustness of this smoothed classifier. We present the tight Gaussian smoothing certificate derived by Cohen et al. [27]. and its generalization to matrices.1 [74, 76]

Assume a continuous  $(N\times D)$ -dimensional input space  $\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}$ , label set  $\mathbb{Y}$  and base classifier  $g:\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}\to \mathbb{Y}$ . Let  $\mu_{\pmb{X}}(\pmb {Z}) = \prod_{d = 1}^{D}\mathcal{N}\left(\pmb{Z}_{:,d}\mid \pmb{X}_{:,d},\sigma^2\mathbf{I}_N\right)$  be the isotropic matrix normal distribution with mean  $\pmb{X}$  and standard deviation  $\sigma$ . Let  $p_{\pmb{X},y} = \operatorname*{Pr}_{\pmb{Z}\sim \mu_{\pmb{X}}} [g(\pmb {Z}) = y]$  be the probability of  $g$  predicting class  $y$  under this smoothing distribution. One can then define a smoothed classifier  $f(\pmb {X}) = \mathrm{argmax}_{y\in \mathbb{Y}}p_{\pmb{X},y}$  that returns the most likely prediction of  $g$  under  $\mu_{\pmb{X}}$ .

Let  $y^{*} = f(\pmb{X})$  be a smoothed prediction. Its robustness to adversarially perturbed inputs  $\pmb{X}' = \pmb{X} + \pmb{\Delta}$  can be certified as follows: First, one can use the fact that  $f(\pmb{X}') = y^{*}$  if  $y^{*}$  is more likely than all other classes combined  $^2$ , i.e.  $p_{\pmb{X}',y^{*}} > 0.5$ . The probability  $p_{\pmb{X}',y^{*}}$  can then be lower-bounded by finding the worst-case classifier from a set of functions  $\mathbb{H}$  with  $g \in \mathbb{H}$ .

$$
p _ {\mathbf {X} ^ {\prime}, y ^ {*}} \geq \min  _ {h \in \mathbb {H}} \Pr_ {\mathbf {Z} \sim \mu_ {\mathbf {X} ^ {\prime}}} [ h (\mathbf {Z}) = y ^ {*} ]. \tag {1}
$$

For  $\mathbb{H} = \left\{h:\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}\to \mathbb{Y}\mid \operatorname *{Pr}_{Z\sim \mu_X}\left[h(Z) = y^*\right]\geq p_{X,y^*}\right\}$ , the set of classifiers that are at least as likely as  $g$  to predict  $y^{*}$ , the exact solution is given by the Neyman-Pearson lemma [96] from statistical testing. The optimal value is  $\Phi \left(\Phi^{-1}(p_{X,y^*}) - \frac{\|\Delta\|_2}{\sigma}\right)$ , where  $\Phi$  is the standard-normal CDF and  $||\cdot ||_2$  is the Frobenius norm. If  $||\Delta ||_2 < \sigma \Phi^{-1}(p_{X,y^*})$ , then  $p_{X',y^*} > 0.5$  and the prediction is provably robust. Because Eq. (1) was solved exactly, this is a tight certificate, i.e. the best possible certificate that can be obtained by only using black-box knowledge about prediction probability  $p_{X,y^*}$  of base classifier  $g$  under smoothing distribution  $\mu_{X}$ .

Probabilistic certificates. For neural networks, the prediction probability  $p_{\mathbf{X},y^*}$  can usually not be computed analytically. Instead, one has to use Monte Carlo sampling to compute a lower confidence bound  $\underline{p_{\mathbf{x}',y^*}}$  that holds with high probability  $1 - \alpha$ . The resulting certificate is a probabilistic one.

# 4 Problem setting

We consider a similar setup to that described in the previous section, i.e. we have a smoothed classifier  $f: \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{Y}$  that is the result of randomly smoothing a base classifier  $g$  with an isotropic matrix normal distribution  $\mu_{\mathbf{X}}$ . Given a clean prediction  $y^{*} = f(\mathbf{X})$  with clean prediction probability  $p_{\mathbf{X},y^{*}}$ , we want to determine whether  $f(\mathbf{X}') = y^{*}$  for an adversariably perturbed input  $\mathbf{X}' = \mathbf{X} + \Delta$ . Different from all prior work, we additionally assume that the base classifier  $g$  (not  $f$ ) is invariant under a group of transformations  $\mathbb{T}$ , i.e. a set of functions that contains the identity function as well as the inverse of each element, and is associative and closed under function composition.

Definition 1 (Group-invariance). A function  $h: \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{B}$  is invariant under a group of transformations  $\mathbb{T}$  if  $\forall x \in \mathbb{A}, \forall \tau \in \mathbb{T}: h(x) = h(\tau(x))$ .

Translation, rotation and permutation invariance in  $\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}$  correspond to the groups  $\{\pmb {X}\mapsto \pmb {X} + \mathbf{1}_N\pmb {c}^T\mid \pmb {c}\in \mathbb{R}^D\}$ ,  $\{\pmb {X}\mapsto \pmb {X}\pmb {R}^T\mid \pmb {R}\in SO(D)\}$ , and  $\{\pmb {X}\mapsto \pmb {P}\pmb {X}\mid \pmb {P}\in S_N\}$ , where  $SO(D)$  is the special orthogonal group, i.e. the set of all  $D\times D$  rotation matrices, and  $S_{N}$  is the symmetric group, i.e. the set of all  $N\times N$  permutation matrices.

# 5 Post-processing-based gray-box certificates

Our first method for leveraging invariances for certification is based on the insight that certificates correspond to sets of inputs  $\mathbb{B} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$  that preserve clean prediction  $y^*$  and invariances correspond to sets of transformations that preserve predictions. Consequently, post-processing  $\mathbb{B}$  by applying the transformations from  $\mathbb{T}$  yields a new set of inputs  $\tilde{\mathbb{B}} \supseteq \mathbb{B}$  that provably preserve the clean prediction.

Theorem 1. Let  $h \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{Y}$  be invariant under a group of transformations  $\mathbb{T}$ . Let  $y^* = h(\pmb{X})$  be a prediction that is certifiably robust to a set of perturbed inputs  $\mathbb{B} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$ , i.e.  $\forall \pmb{Z} \in \mathbb{B} : h(\pmb{Z}) = y^*$ . Let  $\tilde{\mathbb{B}} = \{\tau(\pmb{Z}) \mid \pmb{Z} \in \mathbb{B}, \tau \in \mathbb{T}\}$ . Then  $\forall \pmb{X}' \in \tilde{\mathbb{B}} : h(\pmb{X}') = y^*$ .

To simplify the comparison with the tight gray-box certificates we shall derive shortly, we adopt an equivalent, pre-processing-based perspective for the special case of Frobenius norm certificates: Input  $\mathbf{X}'$  is provably not an adversarial example, if it can be mapped into  $\mathbb{B}$  via a transformation from  $\mathbb{T}$ .

It is not an adversarial example. Input  $\mathbf{X}''$  can not be translated into  $\mathbb{B}$ . It might be an adversarial example. b.) The prediction  $y^{*} = f(\mathbf{X})$  is certifiably robust to all perturbed inputs from region  $\tilde{\mathbb{B}}$ , the union over all translations of  $\mathbb{B}$ .  
(b) Post-processing perspective

Theorem 2. Let  $h \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{Y}$  be invariant under a group of transformations  $\mathbb{T}$ . Let  $y^* = h(\pmb{X})$  be a prediction that is certifiably robust to a set of perturbed inputs  $\mathbb{B} = \{\pmb{Z} \mid ||\pmb{Z} - \pmb{X}||_2 < r\}$ , i.e.  $\forall \pmb{Z} \in \mathbb{B}: h(\pmb{Z}) = y^*$ . If  $\min_{\tau \in \mathbb{T}} ||\tau(\pmb{X}') - \pmb{X}||_2 < r$ , then  $h(\pmb{X}') = y^*$ .

Fig. 1 compares the two perspectives. Note that Theorem 2 is only a way of determining whether  $\pmb{X}^{\prime} \in \tilde{\mathbb{B}}$  for a specific  $\pmb{X}^{\prime}$ . It is not necessary for specifying the post-processed certified region. Applying it to translation invariance shows that  $h(\pmb{X}^{\prime}) = y^{*}$  if  $\left|\left|\Delta -\mathbf{1}_N\overline{\Delta}\right|\right|_2 < r$ , where  $\overline{\mathbf{X}},\overline{\mathbf{\Delta}} \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times D}$  are column-wise averages. For rotation invariance, Theorem 2 guarantees robustness if  $\left|\left|\pmb {X}'\pmb {R}^T -\pmb {X}\right|\right|_2 < r$ , where  $\pmb{R}$  is an optimal rotation matrix defined by the singular value decomposition of  $\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X}^\prime$  [97, 98]. In Appendix C, we prove these results and discuss other invariances.

# 5.1 Application to randomized smoothing certificates

While the post-processing approach may seem straightforward, it has two practical limitations that we shall resolve shortly. Firstly, one may not be able to obtain a certified region  $\mathbb{B}$ . For example, no white-box robustness certificate for rotation-invariant models has been proposed thus far. Secondly, randomized smoothing, which can be applied to arbitrary models, only certifies the predictions of smoothed classifier  $f$ . Recall from Section 4, that we only know base classifier  $g$  to be invariant under group  $\mathbb{T}$ . There is no guarantee that  $f$  shares the same invariances, i.e. postprocessing  $\mathbb{B}$  with  $\mathbb{T}$  may yield invalid certificates. We address this issue by proving the following result in Appendix C:

Theorem 3. Let base classifier  $g: \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{Y}$  be invariant under a group of transformations  $\mathbb{T} \subseteq \{X \mapsto P\eta(X) \mid P \in S(N), \eta \in E(D)\}$ , where  $S(N)$  is the symmetric group in  $N$  dimensions,  $E(D)$  is the Euclidean group in  $D$  dimensions and  $\eta: \mathbb{R}^D \to \mathbb{R}^D$  is applied row-wise. Then the isotropically smoothed classifier  $f$ , as defined in Section 3, is also invariant under  $\mathbb{T}$ .

In other words: Isotropic Gaussian smoothing preserves invariance to any group of transformations composed of permutation and distance-preserving functions in Euclidean space, i.e. rotation, reflection and translation. We may thus instantiate Theorems 1 and 2 with  $h = f$  and  $r = \sigma \Phi^{-1}(p_{X,y^*})$ .

# 6 Tight gray-box certificates

Now that we have derived the first gray-box certificates for invariant models, one may naturally wonder about their optimality. We answer this by deriving tight gray-box certificates, i.e. the best certificates that can be obtained for prediction  $y^{*}$  using only the invariances of base classifier  $g$  under group  $\mathbb{T}$  and its prediction probability  $p_{X,y^{*}}$  under clean smoothing distribution  $\mu_{X}$ . To do so, we find the worst-case invariant classifier, i.e. solve  $\min_{h\in \mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{T}}}\operatorname *{Pr}_{Z\sim \mu_{X'}}[h(Z) = y^* ]$  with

$$
\mathbb {H} _ {\mathbb {T}} = \left\{h: \mathbb {R} ^ {N \times D} \rightarrow \mathbb {Y} \mid \Pr_ {\boldsymbol {Z} \sim \mu_ {\boldsymbol {X}}} [ h (\boldsymbol {Z}) = y ^ {*} ] \geq p _ {\boldsymbol {X}, y ^ {*}}, \forall \boldsymbol {Z}, \forall \boldsymbol {Z} ^ {\prime} \in [ \boldsymbol {Z} ] _ {\mathbb {T}}: h (\boldsymbol {Z}) = h \left(\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {\prime}\right)\right\}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $[Z]_{\mathbb{T}}$  is the equivalence class of  $Z$  with respect to invariance under group  $\mathbb{T}$ :

Definition 2 (Equivalence classes). The equivalence class of an input  $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$  w.r.t. invariance under a group of transformations  $\mathbb{T}$  is  $[x]_{\mathbb{T}} = \{\tau(x) \mid \tau \in \mathbb{T}\}$ .

# 6.1 Certification methodology

To work with invariance constraints, it is convenient to not think of  $h$  as a function, but a family of variables  $(h_{\mathbf{Z}}) \in \mathbb{Y}$  indexed by  $\mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$ . The invariance constraint states that all variables from an equivalence class should have the same value, i.e.  $\forall \mathbf{Z}, \forall \mathbf{Z}' \in [\mathbf{Z}]_{\mathbb{T}} : h_{\mathbf{Z}} = h_{\mathbf{Z}'}$ . Intuitively, such constraints can be enforced by replacing each occurrence of a variable with a distinct representative of its equivalence class. We propose to formalize this idea by using canonical representations:

Definition 3 (Canonical representation). A canonical representation for invariance under a group of transformations  $\mathbb{T}$  is a function  $\gamma : \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$  with

$$
\forall \boldsymbol {Z} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {N \times D}: \gamma (\boldsymbol {Z}) \in [ \boldsymbol {Z} ] _ {\mathbb {T}}, \tag {3}
$$

$$
\forall \boldsymbol {Z} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {N \times D}, \forall \boldsymbol {Z} ^ {\prime} \in [ \boldsymbol {Z} ] _ {\mathbb {T}}: \gamma (\boldsymbol {Z}) = \gamma \left(\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {\prime}\right). \tag {4}
$$

In Appendix D.3, we prove that canonical representations let us discard the invariance constraints:

Theorem 4. Let  $g: \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{Y}$  be invariant under group  $\mathbb{T}$  and let  $\mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{T}}$  be defined as in Eq. (2). If  $\gamma: \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$  is a canonical representation for invariance under  $\mathbb{T}$ , then

$$
\min _ {h \in \mathbb {H} _ {\mathbb {T}}} \operatorname * {P r} _ {\boldsymbol {Z} \sim \mu_ {\boldsymbol {X} ^ {\prime}}} [ h (\boldsymbol {Z}) = y ^ {*} ] = \min _ {h: \mathbb {R} ^ {N \times D} \to \mathbb {Y}} \operatorname * {P r} _ {\boldsymbol {Z} \sim \mu_ {\boldsymbol {X} ^ {\prime}}} [ h (\gamma (\boldsymbol {Z})) = y ^ {*} ] s. t. \operatorname * {P r} _ {\boldsymbol {Z} \sim \mu_ {\boldsymbol {X}}} [ h (\gamma (\boldsymbol {Z})) = y ^ {*} ] \geq p _ {\boldsymbol {X}, y ^ {*}}.
$$

After that, we can perform a carefully chosen substitution  $\xi : \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{R}^K$  for some  $K \in \mathbb{N}$  to modify the probability integrals and show that applying the canonical representation is equivalent to mapping  $\mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$  onto a lower-dimensional subspace of  $\xi\left(\mathbb{R}^{N \times D}\right)$  that is occupied by the representatives of the different equivalence classes. We can then find the marginal distribution over this subspace and apply the Neyman-Pearson lemma [96] from statistical testing to solve our problem exactly, i.e. find the worst-case classifier. We present a more formal discussion of our method in Appendix D.2.

# 6.2 Translation invariance

Applying our procedure to translation invariance (see Appendix D.4) shows the following:

Theorem 5. Let  $g: \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{Y}$  be translation invariant and  $\mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{T}}$  be defined as in Eq. (2). Then

$$
\min  _ {h \in \mathbb {H} _ {\mathbb {T}}} \operatorname * {P r} _ {\boldsymbol {Z} \sim \mu_ {\boldsymbol {X} ^ {\prime}}} [ h (\boldsymbol {Z}) = y ^ {*} ] = \Phi \left(\Phi^ {- 1} \left(p _ {\boldsymbol {X}, y ^ {*}}\right) - \frac {\left| \left| \boldsymbol {\Delta} - \mathbf {1} _ {N} \overline {{\boldsymbol {\Delta}}} \right| \right| _ {2}}{\sigma}\right),
$$

where  $\overline{\Delta} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times D}$  are the column-wise average of  $\Delta = X' - X$  and  $\sigma$  is the standard deviation of the isotropic matrix normal smoothing distribution  $\mu_{X}$ .

Substituting into the robustness condition  $\min_{h\in \mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{T}}}\operatorname *{Pr}_{\boldsymbol {Z}\sim \mu_{\boldsymbol{X}^{\prime}}}[h(\boldsymbol {Z}) = y^{*}] > \frac{1}{2}$  and solving for  $\left|\left|\pmb {\Delta} - \mathbf{1}_N\overline{\pmb{\Delta}}\right|\right|_2$  shows that  $f(\pmb {X}^{\prime}) = y^{*}$  if  $\left|\left|\pmb {\Delta} - \mathbf{1}_N\overline{\pmb{\Delta}}\right|\right|_2 <   \sigma \Phi^{-1}(p_{\pmb {X},y^*})$  . We see that this certificate is identical to its post-processing-based counterpart from Section 5. In other words: The post-processing-based certificate for translation invariance is provably tight.

# 6.3 Rotation invariance in 2D

Considering the previous result, one may also suspect the post-processing-based certificate for rotation invariance, i.e. invariance under  $\{\pmb{X} \rightarrow \pmb{X}\pmb{R}^T \mid \pmb{R} \in SO(D)\}$ , to be tight. This is not the case:

Theorem 6. Let  $g: \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \to \mathbb{Y}$  be translation invariant and  $\mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{T}}$  be defined as in Eq. (2). Further assume that  $\exists \pmb{R} \in SO(D): \pmb{X}'\pmb{R}^T = \pmb{X}$  and that  $p_{\pmb{X},y^*} \in (0,1)$ . Then, for all  $\pmb{R} \in SO(D)$ :

$$
\min  _ {h \in \mathbb {H} _ {\mathbb {T}}} \Pr_ {\boldsymbol {Z} \sim \mu_ {\boldsymbol {X} ^ {\prime}}} [ h (\boldsymbol {Z}) = y ^ {*} ] \geq \Phi \left(\Phi^ {- 1} \left(p _ {\boldsymbol {X}, y ^ {*}}\right) - \frac {\left| \left| \boldsymbol {X} ^ {\prime} \boldsymbol {R} ^ {T} - \boldsymbol {X} \right| \right| _ {2}}{\sigma}\right). \tag {5}
$$

We present the proof in Appendix E. Our certification procedure based on canonical representations, however, lets us derive the tight, strictly stronger certificates for rotation invariance in 2D (see Appendix D.5). In the following, let  $\langle \mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\rangle_{\mathrm{F}}$  be the Frobenius inner product  $\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\mathbf{A}_n^T\mathbf{B}_n$  and let  $\pmb {R}(\theta)\in SO(2)$  be the matrix that rotates counter-clockwise by angle  $\theta$ .

Theorem 7. Let  $g: \mathbb{R}^{N \times 2} \to \mathbb{Y}$  be rotation invariant and  $\mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{T}}$  be defined as in Eq. (2). Then

$$
\min  _ {h \in \mathbb {H} _ {\mathrm {T}}} \Pr_ {\boldsymbol {Z} \sim \mu_ {\boldsymbol {X} ^ {\prime}}} [ h (\boldsymbol {Z}) = y ^ {*} ] = \Pr_ {\boldsymbol {q} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(\boldsymbol {m} ^ {(1)}, \boldsymbol {\Sigma}\right)} [ \rho (\boldsymbol {q}) \leq t ] \tag {6}
$$

$$
w i t h \quad t \in \mathbb {R} \quad s. t. \quad \Pr_ {\boldsymbol {q} \sim \mathcal {N} (\boldsymbol {m} ^ {(2)}, \boldsymbol {\Sigma})} [ \rho (\boldsymbol {q}) \leq t ] = p _ {\boldsymbol {X}, \boldsymbol {y} ^ {*}} \tag {7}
$$

$$
a n d \rho (\boldsymbol {q}) = \mathcal {I} _ {0} \left(\sqrt {q _ {1} ^ {2} + q _ {2} ^ {2}}\right) / \mathcal {I} _ {0} \left(\sqrt {q _ {3} ^ {2} + q _ {4} ^ {2}}\right), \tag {8}
$$

where  $\mathcal{I}_0$  is the modified Bessel function of the first kind and order 0, and the entries of  $\pmb{m}^{(1)},\pmb{m}^{(2)}\in \mathbb{R}^4$ ,  $\pmb {\Sigma}\in \mathbb{R}^{4\times 4}$  are linear combinations (see Appendix D.5) of clean data norm  $||X||_2$ , perturbation norm  $||\Delta ||_2$  and parameters  $\epsilon_{1} = \langle X,\Delta \rangle_{\mathrm{F}}$ ,  $\epsilon_{2} = \left\langle X R\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{T},\Delta \right\rangle_{\mathrm{F}}$ .

Because this result is somewhat more involved than the previous ones, let us first examine its parameters, then explain how to evaluate it and finally discuss its connection to prior work.

Certificate parameters. Different from the black-box certificate, which only depends on  $||\Delta ||_2$  this certificate also depends on the clean data norm  $\| X\| _2$ . It further depends on  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$ , Frobenius inner products between  $\pmb{\Delta}$ , and the clean input  $\mathbf{X}$  before and after a rotation by  $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ . These parameters capture the orientation of  $\mathbf{X}'$  relative to  $\mathbf{X}$ , as one would expect from a rotation-invariance aware certificate. Note that  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$  always fulfill  $\sqrt{\epsilon_1^2 + \epsilon_2^2} \leq ||\boldsymbol {X}||_2||\boldsymbol {\Delta}||_2$  (see Appendix H).

Certificate evaluation. Evidently, we do not have a closed-form analytical expression for the probabilities in Eqs. (6) and (7). However, recall from Section 3 that randomized smoothing already involves an intractable probability, namely  $p_{\mathbf{X},y^{*}}$ . One has to use Monte Carlo sampling to compute a lower confidence bound that hold with high probability  $1 - \alpha$ . We propose to adopt the same approach: First, we bound threshold  $t$  from Eq. (7). Then, we bound probability  $\operatorname*{Pr}_{q \sim \mathcal{N}(m^{(1)}, \Sigma)}[\rho(\boldsymbol{q}) \leq t]$  from Eq. (6). We discuss the full algorithm and how to ensure that all bounds simultaneously hold in Appendix D.9. Because the probabilities only involve 4-dimensional normal distributions and do not depend on base classifier  $g$ , one can use a large number of samples to obtain narrow bounds at little computational cost (e.g. 0.59s for 100000 samples per confidence bound on an Intel Xeon E5-2630 CPU).

Connection to prior work. During our derivation of Theorem 7 (see Appendix D.5), we show that the worst-case invariant classifier, i.e. the minimizer of our optimization problem, is a function that predicts  $y^{*}$  if and only if  $\frac{\beta(\mathbf{X}',\mathbf{Z})}{\beta(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z})}\leq t$  with  $\beta (\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z}) = \int_0^{2\pi}\exp \left(\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\left\langle \mathbf{X},\mathbf{ZR}(\theta)^T\right\rangle_{\mathrm{F}}\right)d\theta$ . Different from black-box randomized smoothing, where the worst-case classifier is a linear model [27], this classifier evaluates Gaussian kernels of  $(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z})$  and  $(\mathbf{X}',\mathbf{Z})$  and averages them over all possible rotations. This group averaging is a key technique for building invariant models [7, 99-103] Group-averaged kernels have been proposed in [16] as "Haar integration kernels". It is fascinating to see them naturally materialize from nothing but an invariance constraint.

# 6.4 Generalizations

In Appendix D.6 we generalize our result to elemental rotations in 3D, i.e. rotations from  $SO(3,d) \coloneqq \{R \mid R \in SO(3), R_d = e_d\}$  with indicator vector  $e_d$ . The certificate differs from Theorem 7 in that it also depends on the amount of perturbation along rotation axis  $d$ , i.e.  $||\Delta_{:,d}||_2$ . For  $||\Delta_{:,d}||_2 = 0$  both certificates are identical. Note that every model that is invariant to arbitrary rotations is also invariant to elemental rotations. In Appendices D.7 and D.8 we further prove that additionally enforcing translation invariance is equivalent to centering  $X$  and  $\Delta$  before evaluating the certificates for rotation invariance, which is consistent with our results from Section 6.2.

# 7 Limitations and broader impact

The main limitation of our work lies in its exploratory nature. In Section 5, we have derived the first certificates for models invariant under groups composed of permutation and arbitrary Euclidean isometries. However, there is a vast swath of invariances that we have not covered, such as spatio-temporal invariances [42], invariance under graph isometries [9] or invariances for planar images [7]. Furthermore, we have not yet derived tight certificates for all Euclidean isometries (though our approach based on canonical representations could conceivably be applied to them).

Broader impact. With the growing prevalence of machine learning in safety-critical and sensitive domains like autonomous driving [104, 105] or healthcare [106, 107], models that are not only accurate, but trustworthy promise to become increasingly important. Robustness certification is one pillar of trustworthy machine learning, alongside other concepts like algorithmic fairness [108, 109] or differential privacy [110, 111]. Unique to our work is that we certify robustness for models with spatial invariances. These invariances naturally occur in the physical sciences, including those with a direct societal impact like pharmacology and biochemistry. Our work can be seen as a first step towards provable trustworthiness for tasks like drug discovery [37-39] or protein folding [43-47].

# 8 Experimental evaluation

We know that the post-processing-based certificate for translation invariance is provably tight and can certify robustness for a region with infinitely larger volume than black-box randomized smoothing (see Fig. 1). We therefore focus our experimental evaluation on comparing the post-processing-based certificates for rotation invariance from Section 5 to the provably tight ones from Section 6. Recall that the post-processed certificate for rotation invariance guarantees robustness for the set  $\{ZRT\mid R\in SO(D),||Z - X||_2\leq r\}$  with  $r = \sigma \Phi^{-1}(p_{X,y^*})$ . In other words: It certifies robustness for perturbations with rotational components that can be eliminated to bring  $X^{\prime}$  into distance  $r$  of  $X$ . We want to understand whether the tight certificates offer any benefit beyond that, or if the strict inequality in Theorem 6 is due to some negligible  $\epsilon$ . To this end, we first thoroughly examine the four-dimensional parameter space of the tight certificate for 2D rotation invariance and then verify our findings by applying our certificates to rotation invariant point cloud classifiers.

All parameters and experimental details are specified in Appendix B. A reference implementation is made available with the supplementary material. We use 10000 samples per confidence bound and set  $\alpha = 0.001$ , i.e. all certificates hold with  $99.9\%$  probability.

# 8.1 Tight certificate parameter space

Recall that the tight certificate for rotation invariance depends on  $||\mathbf{X}||_2, ||\pmb{\Delta}||_2$  and parameters  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$ , which capture the orientation of the perturbed point cloud and fulfill  $\sqrt{\epsilon_1^2 + \epsilon_2^2} \leq ||\mathbf{X}||_2 \cdot ||\pmb{\Delta}||_2$ . To avoid clutter, we define  $\tilde{\epsilon}_k \coloneqq \epsilon_k / (||\mathbf{X}||_2 \cdot ||\pmb{\Delta}||_2)$ . As our metric for this section, we report  $p_{\mathrm{min}}$ , the smallest probability  $p_{\mathbf{X},y^*}$  for which a prediction can still be certified<sup>3</sup> (recall that the base classifier  $g$  only affects the certificate through this prediction probability).

Adversarial scaling. First, we assume that  $\mathbf{X}' = (1 + \beta)\mathbf{X}$ , i.e. the input is adversarially scaled. In this case, we have  $\tilde{\epsilon}_1 = 1$  and  $\tilde{\epsilon}_2 = 0$ . We then vary  $||\pmb{\Delta}||_2$  and  $||\mathbf{X}||_2$  and evaluate our certificates. Note that such attacks have no rotational component, i.e. the post-processing-based certificate is identical to the black-box one. Fig. 2 shows that, even in the absence of rotations, the tight certificate

Figure 4: Difference in  $p_{\mathrm{min}}$  between the tight certificate for 2D rotation invariance and the black-box baseline for  $\sigma = 0.5$ ,  $||\pmb{\Delta}|| = 0.5$  under varying  $||\pmb{X}||$ ,  $\tilde{\epsilon}_1$  and  $\tilde{\epsilon}_2$ . As  $||\pmb{X}||$  increases, the regions where the tight certificate outperforms the black-box baseline shrink.

can yield significantly stronger guarantees. For  $\sigma = 0.5$  and  $||\pmb{X}||_2 = 0.01$ , post-processing can only certify robustness for a prediction with  $p_{\pmb{X},y^*} = 0.8$  if  $||\pmb{\Delta}||_2 \leq 0.4$ . The tight certificate can certify robustness up to  $||\pmb{\Delta}||_2 = 0.73$ . However, the gap shrinks, as the norm of the clean data increases.

Effect of data norm. We would like to see if this is a pervasive pattern. To this end, we fix  $||\Delta ||_2$  gradually increase  $||X||_2$ , and evaluate the tight certificate for  $\tilde{\epsilon}_1$ ,  $\tilde{\epsilon}_2$  on a  $100\times 100$  rasterization of  $[0,1]\times [0,1]$ . We then measure the difference  $d(p_{\mathrm{min}})$  to the black-box certificate (we will discuss how these results relate to the post-processing-based one shortly). Fig. 4 shows that for small  $||X||_2$ , the tight certificate outperforms the black-box certificate for arbitrary perturbations of norm  $||\Delta ||_2$ . But, as  $||X||_2$  increases, the regions where it outperforms the black-box one shrink.

Rotational components. Simple algebra (see Appendix H) shows that for any combination of  $||X||_2$  and  $||\Delta||_2$ , adversarial rotations, i.e.  $X' = XRT$  such that  $||X' - X|| = ||\Delta||$ , correspond to two specific points with  $\sqrt{\tilde{\epsilon}_1^2 + \tilde{\epsilon}_2^2} = 1$  in the certificate's parameter space. In Fig. 3 we fix  $\sigma = 0.5$  and  $||X||_2 = 1$ , vary  $||\Delta||$  and highlight these two points. We observe that the tight certificate only outperforms the black-box certificate for values of  $\tilde{\epsilon}_1, \tilde{\epsilon}_2$  that are close to adversarial rotations. However, robustness to such attacks can also be readily certified via post-processing. Combined with our previous observations, we expect the tight and the post-processing-based certificate to perform similarly well, assuming that the smoothing standard deviation  $\sigma$  is small relative to  $||X||_2$ .

# 8.2 Application to point cloud classification

To verify whether our observations hold in practice, we apply our certificates to point cloud classification. We consider two datasets: 3D point cloud representations of ModelNet40 [112], which consists of CAD models from 40 different categories, and 2D point cloud representations of MNIST [113]. We apply the same pre-processing steps as in [6]. As our base classifiers, we use rotation and translation (i.e.  $SE(D)$ ) invariant versions of two well-established models: PointNet [6] and DGCNN [114]. To implement the invariances, we center the input data, perform principal component analysis, apply the

The tight and post-processing-based datasets, under varying standard deviation  $\sigma$  certificates yield similar certified accuracies.

![](images/354882bc869ee49337a9e8171a834aa0ea293f401a771bc3c0cdcbd79c96fc6c.jpg)

model to all possible poses (see discussion in [115]) and average the output logits (EnsPointNet and EnsDGCNN). In addition, we consider a more refined model [116] that combines canonical poses via a self-attention mechanism (AttnPointNet). Certification is performed on the default test sets.

Practical smoothing parameters. Fig. 5 shows the test set accuracies of randomly smoothed models under varying standard deviations  $\sigma$ . Values of  $\sigma$  that preserve an accuracy above  $50\%$  are small, relative to the average norm of the test sets (10.67 for MNIST, 19.17 for ModelNet40). Going by our previous results, we expect the tight and post-processing based certificates to perform similarly well.

Adversarial scaling. In Fig. 6 we again consider adversarial scaling, i.e. attacks without rotational components, but applied to the MNIST point cloud dataset with  $\sigma = 0.15$ . We report the certified accuracy, i.e. the percentage of correct and provably robust predictions, for certification with  $(SE(2))$  and without  $(SO(2))$  translation invariance. The tight and post-processing-based certificate yield similar results. Note that the certified accuracies of the tight method are in fact marginally lower, because we bound the certificates using Monte Carlo sampling (see Section 6.3). We further observe that additionally enforcing translation invariance (i.e.  $SE(2)$ ) strengthens both approaches.

The gray-box certificates effectively eliminate the induced rotation, while the black-box method cannot certify robustness for large  $\theta$ .

Rotational components. Finally, we study perturbations with rotational components. We fix  $||\Delta||$ , randomly sample perturbations of the specified norm and then rotate  $Z = X + \Delta$  by a specified angle  $\theta \in [0,10^{\circ}]$  (in the case of ModelNet40, around one randomly chosen coordinate axis). For each element of the test set and each  $\theta$ , we generate 10 such samples. We then compute the percentage of samples  $X'$  for which  $f(X)$  is correct and  $f(X') = f(X)$  is provably guaranteed ('probabilistic certified accuracy'). Fig. 7 shows results for MNIST and ModelNet40 evaluated with  $||\Delta|| = \sigma = 0.1$  ( $SE(3,d)$  refers to elemental rotations). The black-box baseline's probabilistic certified accuracy drops close to 0 for  $\theta = 2^{\circ}$ . The gray-box certificates are almost constant in  $\theta$ , i.e. effectively eliminate any induced rotation. However, the tight certificate did not offer any benefit beyond that. We did not observe a single sample for which only the tight certificate could guarantee robustness.

In Appendix A we repeat the experiments from this and the previous section for various other combinations of parameter values. All results are consistent with the ones presented here, confirming that the post-processing approach offers a good approximation of the tight certificates in practice.

# 9 Conclusion

For the first time, we have studied the use of invariances for robustness certification. We proposed a gray-box approach, combining white-box knowledge about invariances with black-box randomized smoothing. We have derived a post-processing-based procedure for certification that can be applied to arbitrary models with invariance to permutations and Euclidean isometries. We have proven that the post-processed certificate for translation invariance is tight and derived strictly stronger certificates for rotation invariance. Our experiments are to be interpreted in two ways: The fact that it is possible to derive tight invariance-aware certificates and there exist scenarios such that they offer stronger guarantees for arbitrary perturbations should be an exciting inspiration for future work. The fact that post-processing yields semantically meaningful certificates that offer good approximations of our tight certificates should invite its application to real-world tasks with inherent invariances.
