# ABSTRACT

Distributed Mean Estimation (DME) is a fundamental building block in communication efficient federated learning. In DME, clients communicate their lossily compressed gradients to the parameter server, which estimates the average and updates the model. State of the art DME techniques apply either unbiased quantization methods, resulting in large estimation errors, or biased quantization methods, where unbiaseding the result requires that the server decodes each gradient individually, which markedly slows the aggregation time. In this paper, we propose QUIC-FL, a DME algorithm that achieves the best of all worlds. QUIC-FL is unbiased, offers fast aggregation time, and is competitive with the most accurate (slow aggregation) DME techniques. To achieve this, we formalize the problem in a novel way that allows us to use standard solvers to design near-optimal unbiased quantization schemes.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In federated learning McMahan et al. (2017); Kairouz et al. (2019), clients periodically send their gradients to the parameter server, which calculates their means. This communication is often a network bottleneck, and methods to approximate the mean using small communication are desirable. The Distributed Mean Estimation problem (DME) Suresh et al. (2017) formalizes this fundamental building block as follows: each of  $n$  clients communicate a representation of a  $d$ -dimensional vector to a parameter server which estimates the vectors' mean.

Various DME methods have been studied (e.g., Suresh et al. (2017); Konečný & Richtárik (2018); Vargaftik et al. (2021); Davies et al. (2021); Vargaftik et al. (2022)), examining tradeoffs between the required bandwidth and performance metrics such as the estimation accuracy, learning speed, and the eventual accuracy of the model.

These works utilize lossy compression techniques, using only a small number of bits per coordinate, which is shown to accelerate the training process Bai et al. (2021); Zhong et al. (2021). For example, in Suresh et al. (2017), each client randomly rotates its vector before applying stochastic quantization. When receiving the messages from the clients, the server sums up the estimates of the rotated vectors and applies the inverse rotation. As the largest coordinates are asymptotically larger than the mean, their Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) is bounded by  $O(\log d / n)$ . They also propose an entropy encoding method that reduces the NMSE to  $O(1 / n)$  but is slow and not GPU-friendly. A different approach to DME computes the Kashin's representation Lyubarskii & Vershynin (2010) of a client's vector before applying quantization Caldas et al. (2018); Safaryan et al. (2020). Intuitively, this replaces the input  $d$ -dimensional vector by  $\lambda \cdot d$  coefficients, for some  $\lambda > 1$ , each bounded by  $O\left(\sqrt{\|x\|_2 / d}\right)$ . Applying quantization to the coefficients instead of the original vectors allows the server to estimate the mean using  $\lambda > 1$  bits per coordinate with an NMSE of  $O\left(\frac{\lambda^2}{(\sqrt{\lambda} - 1)^4 \cdot n}\right)$ . However, it requires applying multiple randomized Hadamard transforms, slowing down its encoding.

The recently introduced DRIVE Vargaftik et al. (2021) (which uses  $b = 1$  bits per coordinate) and its generalization EDEN Vargaftik et al. (2022) (that works with any  $b > 0$ ) also randomly rotate the input vector, but unlike Suresh et al. (2017) use biased (deterministic) quantization on the rotated coordinates. Interestingly, both yield unbiased estimates of the input vector after multiplying the estimated vector by a real-valued "scale" that is sent by each client together with the quantization. Both solutions have an NMSE of  $O(1/n)$  and are empirically more accurate than Kashin's representation. However, to achieve unbiasedness, each client must generate a distinct rotation matrix independently

from other clients. In turn, the server must invert the rotation for each vector before aggregating them, resulting in  $O(n)$  rotations instead of one, asymptotically increasing the decoding time.

Here we attempt to resolve the decoding time slowdown from these recent state of the art DME techniques Vargaftik et al. (2021; 2022). Again, this slowdown arises because unbiasing the estimates requires each client must use its own independent random rotation, and accordingly the server must invert the rotation for each quantized gradient.

In this work we present Quick Unbiased Compression for Federated Learning (QUIC-FL): a DME algorithm that produces unbiased estimates, with a fast estimation procedure and an NMSE of  $O(1/n)$ . QUIC-FL also leverages random rotations, and uses the observation that after rotation the coordinates' distribution approaches  $d$  i.i.d. normal variables,  $\mathcal{N}(0, \|x\|_2 / d)$  Vargaftik et al. (2021). The goal of QUIC-FL is to unbiasedly quantize each coordinate while minimizing the error. Compared with Suresh et al. (2017), we present two key improvements: (1) Instead of quantizing all coordinates, we allow the algorithm to send an expected  $p$ -fraction of the rotated coordinates exactly (up to precision) for some small  $p$  (e.g.,  $p = 1/512$ ). This limits the range of the other coordinates to  $[-T_p, T_p]$ , where  $T_p = O(1)$  for any constant  $p > 0$ , thus reducing the possible quantization error significantly. (2) We study how to leverage client-specific shared randomness Ben Basat et al. (2021) to reduce the error further. Specifically, we model the problem of transmitting a "bounded-support" normal random variable  $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \mid Z \in [-T_p, T_p]$ , using  $b \in \mathbb{N}^+$  bits, with the goal of obtaining an unbiased estimate at the server. Our model considers both a client's private randomness and shared randomness between the clients and server, allowing us to derive an input to optimization problem solver, whose output yields algorithms with a near-optimal accuracy to bandwidth tradeoff.

We implement QUIC-FL in PyTorch Paszke et al. (2019) and TensorFlow Abadi et al. (2015), showing that it can compress vectors with over 33 million coordinates within 44 milliseconds and is markedly more accurate than existing fast-estimate approaches such as QSGD Alistarh et al. (2017), Hadamard Suresh et al. (2017), and Kashin Caldas et al. (2018); Safaryan et al. (2020). Compared with DRIVE Vargaftik et al. (2021) and EDEN Vargaftik et al. (2022), QUIC-FL has only slightly worse NMSE (e.g., less than  $1\%$  for  $b = 4$  bits per

dimension) while asymptotically improving the estimation time, as shown on the right. The figure illustrates the cycle (encode plus decode) times vs. NMSE for  $b = 4$  bits per coordinate,  $d = 2^{20}$  dimensions, and  $n = 256$  clients. (see §4 for the algorithms' description.) We summarize the asymptotic guarantees of the discussed DME techniques in Table 1.

We note that our algorithm is based on deriving near-optimal stochastic quantizations for a specific distribution by determining a mathematical program (a set of constraints) fed to an optimization program solver. We believe this approach will prove useful for other problems that use stochastic quantization.

While we have surveyed the most relevant related work above, we review other techniques in Appendix A. (All appendices appear in the supplementary material.)

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

Problems and Metrics. Given a non-zero vector  $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , a vector compression protocol consists of a client that computes a message  $X$  and a server that given the message estimates  $\hat{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ . The vector Normalized Mean Squared Error (vNMSE) of the protocol is defined as  $\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[\|x - \hat{x}\|_2^2\right]}{\|x\|_2^2}$  Vargaftik et al. (2021; 2022).

This problem generalizes to the Distributed Mean Estimation (DME) problem, where  $n$  clients have vectors  $\{x_{c} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}\}$  that they communicate to a centralized server. We are interested in minimizing the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), defined as  $\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[\|\hat{x}_{avg} - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{c=1}^{n} x_{c}\|_{2}^{2}\right]}{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum_{c=1}^{n}\|x_{c}\|_{2}^{2}}$  Suresh et al. (2017); Vargaftik et al. (2021; 2022), where  $\hat{x}_{avg}$  is our estimate of the average  $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{c=1}^{n} x_{c}$ . Note that for unbiased algorithms and independent estimates, we have that  $NMSE = vNMSE / n$  Vargaftik et al. (2021).

Shared randomness. We use both global (common to all clients and the server) and client-specific shared randomness (one client and the server). Client-only randomness is termed private randomness.

# 3 THE QUIC-FL ALGORITHM

# 3.1 BOUNDED-SUPPORT-QUANTIZATION

Our first contribution is the introduction of bounded-support-quantization (BSQ). For a parameter  $p \in (0,1]$ , we pick a threshold  $T_{p}$  such that at most  $d \cdot p$  coordinates can fall outside  $[-T_p,T_p]$ . BSQ separates the vector into two parts: the large coordinates whose absolute value is at least  $T_{p}$ , and the small ones. The large values are sent exactly (matching the precision of the input gradient), whereas the small values are quantized and transmitted using a small number of bits each.

This simple approach decreases the error of every quantized coordinate by bounding the quantized coordinates' support at the cost of transmitting some entries accurately. As stated in Appendix G, we formally show that BSQ, without further assumptions, admits a worst-case  $vNMSE$  of  $\frac{1}{p \cdot (2^b - 1)^2}$ . In particular, when  $p$  and  $b$  are constants, we get an  $NMSE$  of  $O(1/n)$  with encoding and decoding times of  $O(d)$  and  $O(nd)$ , respectively. However, the linear dependence on  $p$  means that the hidden constant in the  $O(1/n)$ $NMSE$  is too large to be practical. For example, if  $p = 2^{-5}$  and  $b = 1$ , we need two bits per coordinate on average: one for sending the exact values (assuming coordinates are single precision floats) and another for stochastically quantizing the remaining coordinates. In turn, we get a  $vNMSE$  bound of  $\frac{1}{2^{-5} \cdot (2^1 - 1)^2} = 32$ . In the following section, we show that combining BSQ with random rotation allows us to get an  $O(1/n)$ $NMSE$  even with a low constant for low values of  $p$ . For example,  $p = 2^{-9}$  and an additional one bit per coordinate for the quantization, we reach a  $vNMSE$  of 1.52, a  $21 \times$  improvement despite using less bandwidth.

# 3.2 ROTATIONS WITH BOUNDED SUPPORT QUANTIZATION

Similarly to previous works Suresh et al. (2017); Vargaftik et al. (2021; 2022), our algorithm QUIC-FL begins by randomly rotating the input vector, after which the coordinates' distribution approaches independent normal random variables for high dimensions Vargaftik et al. (2021). This effectively turns every input into the average case. We note that, unlike Vargaftik et al. (2021; 2022) all clients use the same rotation, generated with global shared randomness. QUIC-FL then utilizes near-optimal unbiased quantization for the normal distribution for each coordinate. We emphasize that QUIC-FL is unbiased for any input; the quantization is tuned for the normal distribution, as after rotation each coordinate it is well-approximated by a normal distribution. Unlike previous algorithms, we combine the rotation with bounded support quantization. QUIC-FL achieves unbiasedness using both private randomness at the client and client-specific shared randomness (shared between it and the server).

As another comparison point, Suresh et al. (2017), given a bit budget of  $b(1 + o(1))$  bits per packet, stochastically quantizes each rotated coordinate into one of  $2^b$  levels. The algorithm uses a max-min normalization, and the levels are uniformly spaced between the minimal and maximal coordinates. Their algorithm then communicates the max and min, together with  $b$  bits per coordinate indicating its quantized level, and is shown to have a NMSE of  $O(\log d / n)$  for any  $b = O(1)$ .

We begin by analyzing the value of rotation with BSQ. Let  $Z = \mathcal{N}(0,1)$  be a normal random variable, modeling a rotated (and scaled) coordinate. Given a user-defined parameter  $p$ , we can compute a

threshold  $T_{p}$  such that  $\operatorname*{Pr}\left[Z \notin [-T_{p}, T_{p}]\right] = p$ . For example, by picking  $p = 2^{-9}$  (i.e., less than  $0.2\%$ ), we get a threshold of  $T_{p} \approx 3.097$ .<sup>2</sup>

In general, for any constant  $p > 0$ , we have  $T_{p}$  is constant, and using  $b$  bits for each coordinate in  $[-T_p,T_p]$  we get a NMSE of  $O(1 / n)$  for any constant  $b$  (due to unbiased and independent quantization among clients). For example, consider sending each coordinate in  $[-T_p,T_p]$  using  $b = 1$  bit per coordinate. One solution would be to use stochastic quantization, i.e., given a coordinate  $Z\in [-T_p,T_p]$  send the bit for which  $\hat{Z} = T_{p}$  with probability  $\frac{Z + T_p}{2T_p}$  and the bit for  $\hat{Z} = -T_{p}$  otherwise. This quantization results in an unbiased estimate with expected squared error of

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ (Z - \widehat {Z}) ^ {2} \right] = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2 \pi}} \int_ {- T _ {p}} ^ {T _ {p}} \left(\frac {z + T _ {p}}{2 T _ {p}} \cdot (z - T _ {p}) ^ {2} + \frac {T _ {p} - z}{2 T _ {p}} \cdot (z + T _ {p}) ^ {2}\right) \cdot e ^ {- \frac {z ^ {2}}{2}} d z.
$$

With  $p = 2^{-9}$  as above, we get  $\mathbb{E}\left[(Z - \hat{Z})^2\right] \approx 8.58$ . We can view the algorithm expressed so far as a special case of QUIC-FL without shared randomness.

As shown in Appendix B, for QUIC-FL (with or without shared randomness) on any  $d$ -dimensional input vector (and any quantization scheme for  $Z \in [-T_p, T_p]$ ),  $vNMSE = \mathbb{E}\left[\left(Z - \hat{Z}\right)^2\right] + O\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log d}{d}}\right)$ . The additional additive term occurs because we chose to optimize for the normal distribution<sup>3</sup> Again, this holds for any initial vector because QUIC-FL starts with a random rotation. Thus, using the above quantization for each coordinate for large gradients results in  $NMSE \approx 8.58/n$ . We next show that additionally using client-specific shared randomness can decrease  $\mathbb{E}\left[(Z - \hat{Z})^2\right]$  and thus the NMSE.

# 3.3 LEVERAGING CLIENT-SPECIFIC SHARED RANDOMNESS

We now provide an example to show how shared randomness can improve the vNMSE, leading to §3.4 where we formalize our approach to finding near-optimal unbiased compression schemes for bounded-support  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$  variables. Using a single shared random bit (i.e.,  $H\in \{0,1\}$ ), we can use the following algorithm, where  $X$  is the sent message and  $\alpha = 0.8$ ,  $\beta = 5.4$  are constants:

$$
X = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1 & \text {i f H = 0 a n d Z \geqslant 0} \\ 0 & \text {i f H = 1 a n d Z <   0} \\ B e r n o u l l i (\frac {2 Z}{\alpha + \beta}) & \text {I f H = 1 a n d Z \geqslant 0} \\ 1 - B e r n o u l l i (\frac {- 2 Z}{\alpha + \beta}) & \text {I f H = 0 a n d Z <   0} \end{array} \right. \quad \hat {Z} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} - \beta & \text {i f H = X = 0} \\ - \alpha & \text {i f H = 1 a n d X = 0} \\ \alpha & \text {I f H = 0 a n d X = 1} \\ \beta & \text {I f H = X = 1} \end{array} \right..
$$

For example, if  $Z = 1$ , then with probability  $1/2$  we have that  $H = 0$  and thus  $X = 1$ , and otherwise the client sends  $X = 1$  with probability  $\frac{2}{\alpha + \beta}$  (and otherwise  $X = 0$ ). Similarly, the reconstruction would be  $\hat{Z} = \alpha$  with probability  $1/2$  (when  $H = 0$ ),  $\hat{Z} = \beta$  with probability  $1/2 \cdot \frac{2}{\alpha + \beta} = 0.16$ , and  $\hat{Z} = -\alpha$  with probability  $1/2 \cdot \frac{\alpha + \beta - 2}{\alpha + \beta} = 0.84$ . Indeed, we have that the estimate is unbiased since:

$$
\mathbb {E} [ \widehat {Z} \mid Z = 1 ] = \alpha \cdot 1 / 2 + \beta \cdot 1 / 2 \cdot \frac {2}{\alpha + \beta} + (- \alpha) \cdot 1 / 2 \cdot \frac {\alpha + \beta - 2}{\alpha + \beta} = 1.
$$

We calculate the quantization's expected squared error, conditioned on  $Z \in [-T_p, T_p]$ . (From symmetry, we integrate over positive  $t$ .)

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ (Z - \hat {Z}) ^ {2} \right] = \sqrt {\frac {2}{\pi}} \left(\int_ {0} ^ {T _ {p}} \frac {1}{2} \cdot \left((z - \alpha) ^ {2} + \frac {2 z}{\alpha + \beta} \cdot (z - \beta) ^ {2} + \frac {\alpha + \beta - 2 z}{\alpha + \beta} \cdot (z + \alpha) ^ {2}\right) \cdot e ^ {- z ^ {2} / 2} d z\right)
$$

Using the same  $p = 2^{-9}$  parameter ( $T_{p} \approx 3.097$ ), we get an error of  $\mathbb{E}\left[(Z - \hat{Z})^{2}\right] \approx 3.29$ ,  $61\%$  lower than without shared randomness. This algorithm is derived from the solver, which numerically approximates the optimal unbiased algorithm with a single shared random bit, in terms of expected squared error, for this  $p$ . We present our general approach for using the solver in the following sections.

# 3.4 DESIGNING NEAR-OPTIMAL UNBIASED COMPRESSION SCHEMES

In order to design our post-rotation compression scheme, we first model the problem as follows:

- We first choose a parameter  $p > 0$ , the expected fraction of coordinates allowed to be sent exactly.  
- The input, known to the client, is a coordinate  $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . The  $p$  parameter restricts further the distribution to  $Z \in [-T_p, T_p]$ .  
- The client-specific shared randomness  $H$  is known to both the client and server, and without loss of generality, we assume that  $H \sim U[0,1]$ . We denote by  $\mathcal{H} = [0,1]$  the domain of  $H$ .  
- We use a bit budget of  $b \in \mathbb{N}^{+}$  bits per coordinate, and accordingly assume that the messages are in the set  $\mathcal{X}_b = \{0, \dots, 2^b - 1\}$ . Again, coordinates outside the range  $[-T_p, T_p]$  are sent exactly.  
- The client is modeled as  $S: \mathcal{H} \times \mathbb{R} \to \Delta(\mathcal{X}_b)$ . That is, the client observes the shared randomness  $H$  and the input  $Z$ , and chooses a distribution over the messages. We further denote by  $S_x(h, z)$  the probability that the client sends  $x \in \mathcal{X}_b$  given  $h$  and  $z$  (i.e.,  $\forall h, z: \sum_{x} S_x(h, z) = 1$ ). For example, it may choose  $S_x(0, 0) = \begin{cases} 1/2 & \text{If } x \in \{0, 1\} \\ 0 & \text{Otherwise} \end{cases}$ . That is, given  $z = h = 0$ , the client shall use private randomness to decide whether to send  $x = 0$  or  $x = 1$ , each with probability  $1/2$ .  
- The server is modeled as a function  $R: \mathcal{H} \times \mathcal{X}_b \to \mathbb{R}$ , such that if the shared randomness is  $h \in \mathcal{H}$  and the server receives the message  $x \in \mathcal{X}_b$ , it produces an estimate  $\widehat{z} = R(h, x)$ .  
- We require that the estimates are unbiased, i.e.,  $\mathbb{E}[\hat{Z} | Z] = Z$ , where the expectation is taken over both the client-specific shared randomness  $H$  and the private randomness of the client.

We are now ready to formally define the optimal unbiased quantization problem:

$$
\underset {S, R} {\mathrm {m i n i m i z e}} \frac {1}{\sqrt {2 \pi}} \int_ {- T _ {p}} ^ {T _ {p}} \int_ {0} ^ {1} \sum_ {x} S _ {x} (h, z) \cdot (z - R (h, x)) ^ {2} \cdot e ^ {- z ^ {2} / 2} d h d z
$$

$$
\text {s u b j e c t} \int_ {0} ^ {1} \sum_ {x} S _ {x} (h, z) \cdot R (h, x) d h = z, \quad \forall z \in [ - T _ {p}, T _ {p} ].
$$

We are unaware of methods for solving the above problem analytically. Instead, we propose a discrete relaxation of the problem, allowing us to approach it with a solver.<sup>5</sup> Namely, we model the algorithm as an optimization problem and let the solver output the optimal algorithm. To that end, we need to discretize the problem. Specifically, we make the following relaxations:

- The shared randomness  $H$  is selected uniformly at random from a finite set of values  $\mathcal{H}_{\ell} \triangleq \{0, \dots, 2^{\ell} - 1\}$ , i.e., using  $\ell$  shared random bits.  
- The bounded-support distribution of a rotated and scaled  $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$  coordinate is approximated using a finite set of quantiles  $\mathcal{Q}_m = \{q_0,\dots ,q_{m - 1}\}$ , for a parameter  $m\in \mathbb{N}^{+}$ . In particular, the quantile  $q_{i}$  is the point on the CDF of the bounded-support normal distribution (restricted to  $[-T_p,T_p])$  such that the  $\operatorname*{Pr}[Z\leqslant q_i\mid Z\in [-T_p,T_p]] = \frac{i}{m - 1}$ . Notice that we have  $m$  such quantiles, corresponding to the probabilities  $\left\{0,\frac{1}{m - 1},\frac{2}{m - 1},\ldots ,1\right\}$ . For example,  $p = 2^{-9}$  and  $m = 4$  we get the quantile set  $\mathcal{Q}_4\approx \{-3.097, - 0.4298,0.4298,3.097\}$ .  
- The client is now modeled as  $S: \mathcal{H}_{\ell} \times \mathcal{Q}_m \to \Delta(\mathcal{X}_b)$ . That is, for each shared randomness  $h \in \mathcal{H}_{\ell}$  and quantile  $q \in \mathcal{Q}_m$  values, the client has a probability distribution on the messages from which it samples, using private randomness, at encoding time.  
- The server is modeled as a function  $R: \mathcal{H}_{\ell} \times \mathcal{X}_b \to \mathbb{R}$ , such that if the shared randomness is  $H$  and the server receives the message  $X$ , it produces an estimate  $\hat{Z} = R(H, X)$ .

Given this modeling, we use the following variables:

-  $s = \{s_{h,q,x} \mid h \in \mathcal{H}_{\ell}, q \in \mathcal{Q}_m, x \in \mathcal{X}_b\}$ , where  $s_{h,q,x}$  denotes the probability of sending a message  $x$ , given the quantile  $q$  and shared randomness value  $h$ . We note that the solver's solution will only instruct us what to do if all our coordinates were quantiles in  $\mathcal{Q}_m$ . In what follows, we show how to interpolate the result and get a practical algorithm for any  $Z \in [-T_p, T_p]$ .  
-  $r = \{r_{h,x} \mid h \in \mathcal{H}_{\ell}, x \in \mathcal{X}_b\}$ , where  $r_{h,x}$  denotes the server's estimate value given the shared randomness  $h$  and the received message  $x$ .

Accordingly, the discretized unbiased quantization problem is defined as:

$$
\underset {s, r} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \quad \frac {1}{m} \cdot \frac {1}{2 ^ {\ell}} \cdot \sum_ {h, q, x} s _ {h, q, x} \cdot (q - r _ {h, x}) ^ {2}
$$

subject to

$$
\left(U n b i a s e d n e s s\right) \quad \frac {1}{2 ^ {\ell}} \cdot \sum_ {h, x} s _ {h, q, x} \cdot r _ {h, x} = q, \quad \forall q
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(\text {P r o b a b i l i t y}\right) \quad \sum_ {x} s _ {h, q, x} = 1, \quad \forall h, q \\ s _ {h, q, x} \geqslant 0, \quad \forall h, q, x \\ \end{array}
$$

As mentioned, the solver's output does not directly yield an implementable algorithm, as it only associates probabilities to each  $\langle h,q,x\rangle$  tuple. A natural option is to first stochastically quantize  $Z$  to a quantile. For example, when  $Z = 1$  and using the  $\mathcal{Q}_4$  described above, before applying the algorithm, we quantize it to  $q^{-} = 0.4298$  with probability  $\approx 0.786$  or  $q^{+} = 3.097$  with probability  $\approx 0.214$ .

This approach gives an algorithm whose pseudo-code is given in Algorithm 1. The resulting algorithm is near-optimal in the sense that as the number of quantiles and shared random bits tend to infinity, we converge to an optimal algorithm. In practice, the solver is only able to produce an output for finite  $m, \ell$  values; this means that the algorithm would be optimal if coordinates are uniformly distributed over  $\mathcal{Q}_m$ , and not in  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ .

In words, in Algorithm 1 each client  $c$  uses shared randomness to compute a global random rotation  $\mathcal{R}$  (note that all clients use the same rotation). Next, it computes the rotated vector  $\mathcal{R}(x_c)$ ; for sufficiently large dimensions, the distribution of each entry in  $\overline{Z}_c$  converges to  $\mathcal{N}\left(0,\frac{\|x_c\|_2^2}{d}\right)$ . The client then normalizes it,  $\overline{Z}_c = \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\|x_c\|_2} \cdot \mathcal{R}(x_c)$ , to have the coordinates roughly distributed  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . Next, it stochastically quantizes the vector to  $\mathcal{Q}_m$ . Namely, for a given coordinate  $Z$ , let  $q^{-}, q^{+} \in \mathcal{Q}_m$  denote the largest quantile smaller or equal to  $Z$ , and the smallest quantile larger than  $q$  respectively. Then we denote by  $\mathcal{Q}_m(Z)$  the stochastic quantization operation that returns  $q^{+}$  with probability  $\frac{Z - q^{-}}{q^{+} - q^{-}}$  and  $q^{-}$  otherwise. The stochastic quantization of the vector applies coordinate-wise, i.e.,  $\mathcal{Q}_m(\overline{Z}_c) = (\mathcal{Q}_m(\overline{Z}_c[0]), \ldots, \mathcal{Q}_m(\overline{Z}_c[d - 1]))$ . The next step is to generate a client-specific shared randomness vector  $\overline{H}_c$  in which each entry is drawn uniformly and independently from  $\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$ . Finally, the client follows the client algorithm produced by the solver. That is, for each coordinate  $Z$ , the client takes the mapped quantile  $q = \mathcal{Q}_m(Z) \in \mathcal{Q}_m$ , considers the set of probabilities  $\{s_{h,q,x} \mid x \in \mathcal{X}_b\}$ , and samples a message accordingly. We denote applying this operation coordinate-wise by  $\overline{X}_c \sim \{x \text{ with prob. } s_{\overline{H}_c, \widetilde{Z}_c, x} \mid x \in \mathcal{X}_b\}$ . It then sends the resulting vector  $\overline{X}_c$  to the server, together with the norm  $\|x_c\|_2$ . In turn, for each client  $c$ , the server estimates its rotated vector by looking up the shared randomness and message for each coordinate. That is, given  $\overline{H}_c = (\overline{H}_c[0], \ldots, \overline{H}_c[d - 1])$  and  $\overline{X}_c = (\overline{X}_c[0], \ldots, \overline{X}_c[d - 1])$  we denote  $r_{\overline{H}_c, \overline{X}_c} = (r_{\overline{H}_c[0], \overline{X}_c[0]}, \ldots)$ . The server then estimates  $\mathcal{R}(x_c)$  as  $\left(\|x_c\| / \sqrt{d} \cdot r_{\overline{H}_c, \overline{X}_c}\right)$  and averages across all clients before performing the inverse rotation. In the next section, we analyze the solver's output and show how to improve this method.

Further optimization A different approach to yield an implementable algorithm from the optimal solution to the discrete problem is to calculate the message distribution directly from the rotated values without stochastically quantizing as we do in Line 2. Indeed, we have found this approach to be somewhat faster and more accurate. Due to space constraints, we defer the details to Appendix C.

# 3.5 HADAMARD

Similarly to previous rotation-based compression algorithms Suresh et al. (2017); Vargaftik et al. (2021; 2022) we propose to use the Randomized Hadamard Transform (RHT) (Ailon & Chazelle, 2009) instead of uniform random rotations. Although RHT does not induce a uniform distribution on the sphere (and the coordinates are not exactly normally distributed), it is considerably more efficient to compute and, under mild assumptions, the resulting distribution is sufficiently close to the normal distribution Vargaftik et al. (2021). Here, we are interested in how using RHT affects the guarantees of our algorithm. We analyze how using RHT affects our guarantees, starting by noting that our algorithm remains unbiased for any input vector. However, adversarial inputs may (1) increase the probability that a rotated coordinate falls outside  $[-T_p,T_p]$  and (2) increase the  $vNMSE$  as the coordinates' distribution deviates from the normal distribution. We show in Appendix D that QUIC-FL with RHT has similar guarantees as with random rotations, albeit somewhat weaker (constant factor increases in the fraction of accurately sent coordinates and  $vNMSE$ ). We note that these guarantees are still stronger than those of DRIVE Vargaftik et al. (2021) and EDEN Vargaftik et al. (2022), which only prove RHT bounds for input vectors whose coordinates are sampled i.i.d. from a distribution with finite moments, and are not applicable to adversarial vectors. In practice, as shown in the evaluation, the actual performance is close to the theoretical results for uniform rotations; improving the bounds is left as future work. In our evaluation, we use QUIC-FL (Algorithm 2) with RHT-based vector rotation.

# 4 EVALUATION

# 4.1 THEORETICAL EVALUATION: NMSE AND SPEED MEASUREMENTS

Parameter Selection. We experiment with how the different parameters (number of quantiles  $m$ , the fraction of coordinates sent exactly  $p$ , the number of shared random bits  $\ell$ , etc.) affect the performance of our algorithm. As shown in Figure 1, introducing shared randomness decreases the vNMSE significantly compared with  $\ell = 0$ . Additionally, the benefit from adding each additional shared random bit diminishes, and the gain beyond  $\ell = 4$  is negligible, especially for large  $b$ . Accordingly, we hereafter use  $\ell = 6$  for  $b = 1$ ,  $\ell = 5$  for  $b = 2$ , and  $\ell = 4$  for  $b \in \{3, 4\}$ . With respect to  $p$ , we determined  $\frac{1}{512}$  as a good balance between the vNMSE and bandwidth overhead.

Comparison to state of the art DME techniques. Next, we compare the performance of QUIC-FL to the baseline algorithms in terms of NMSE, encoding speed, and decoding speed, using an NVIDIA 3080 RTX GPU machine with 32GB RAM and i7-10700K CPU @ 3.80GHz. Specifically, we compare with Hadamard Suresh et al. (2017), Kashin's representation Caldas et al. (2018); Safaryan et al. (2020), QSGD Alistarh et al. (2017), and EDEN Vargaftik et al. (2022). We evaluate two variants of

Figure 2: Comparison to alternatives with  $n$  clients that have the same LogNormal(0,1) input vector Vargaftik et al. (2021; 2022). The default values are  $n = 256$  clients,  $b = 4$  bit budget, and  $d = 2^{20}$  dimensions.

Kashin's representation: (1) The TensorFlow (TF) implementation Authors that, by default, limits the decomposition to three iterations, and (2) the theoretical algorithm that requires  $O(\log(nd))$  iterations. As shown in Figure 2, QUIC-FL has the second-lowest NMSE, slightly higher than EDEN's, which has a far slower decode time. Further, QUIC-FL is significantly more accurate than approaches with similar speeds. We observed that the default TF configuration of Kashin's representation suffers from a bias, and therefore its NMSE does not decrease inversely proportional to  $n$ . In contrast, the theoretical algorithm is unbiased but has a markedly higher encoding time. We observed similar trends for different  $n$ ,  $b$ , and  $d$  values. We consider the algorithms' bandwidth over all coordinates (e.g., with  $b + \frac{64}{512}$  bits for QUIC-FL). Overall, the empirical measurements fall in line with the bounds in Table 1.

# 4.2 FEDERATED LEARNING EXPERIMENTS

Next-word prediction. We evaluate QUIC-FL over the Shakespeare next-word prediction task Shakespeare; McMahan et al. (2017) using an LSTM recurrent model. We run FedAvg McMahan et al. (2017) with the Adam server optimizer Kingma & Ba (2015) and sample  $n = 10$  clients per round. We use the setup from the federated learning benchmark of Reddi et al. (2021), restated for convenience in Appendix E. Figure 3 shows how QUIC-FL compares with other compression schemes at various bit budgets. As shown, QUIC-FL is competitive with EDEN and nearly matches the accuracy of the uncompressed baseline for  $b \geqslant 3$ .

Image classification. We evaluate QUIC-FL against other schemes with 10 persistent clients over uniformly distributed CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets Krizhevsky et al. (2009). We also evaluate Count-Sketch Charikar et al. (2002) (CS), often used for federated compression schemes (e.g., Ivkin et al. (2019)). For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we use ResNet-9 He et al. (2016) and ResNet-18 He et al. (2016), with learning rates of 0.1 and 0.05, respectively. For both datasets, the clients perform a single optimization step at each round. Our setting includes an SGD optimizer with a cross entropy loss criterion, a batch size of 128, and a bit budget  $b = 1$ .

The results are shown in Figure 4, with a rolling mean average window of 500 rounds. As shown, QUIC-FL is competitive with EDEN and the Float32 baseline and is more accurate than other methods.

Next, we consider a highly heterogeneous cross-device setup with 50 clients over MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets Krizhevsky et al. (2009); LeCun et al. (1998; 2010). For MNIST, each client stores only a single class of the dataset and trains LeNet-5 LeCun et al. (1998) with a learning rate of 0.05. For CIFAR-10, all clients have the same data distribution, and each trains ResNet-9 He et al. (2016) with a learning rate of 0.1. At each training round, 10 clients are randomly selected and perform training over 5 local steps. We use an SGD optimizer with a cross entropy loss criterion, a batch size of 128, and a bit budget  $b = 1$ .

Figure 5 shows the results with a rolling mean window of 200 rounds. Again, QUIC-FL is competitive with EDEN and the uncompressed baseline. Kashin-TF is less accurate followed by Hadamard.

Additional evaluation Due to lack of space, we defer additional evaluation results to Appendix F.

# 5 DISCUSSION

In this work, we presented QUIC-FL, a quick unbiased compression algorithm for federated learning. Both theoretically and empirically, QUIC-FL achieves an  $NMSE$  that is comparable with the most accurate DME techniques, while allowing an asymptotically faster decode time.

We point out a few challenging directions for future work. QUIC-FL optimizes the worst-case error, and while it is compatible with orthogonal directions such as sparsification Konečný & Richtárik (2018); Vargaftik et al. (2022); Konečný et al. (2017); Fei et al. (2021), it is unclear how it would leverage potential correlations between coordinates Mitchell et al. (2022) or client vectors Davies et al. (2021). Another direction for future research is understanding how to incorporate non-linear aggregation functions, such as approximate geometric median, that have shown to improve the training robustness Pillutla et al. (2022).
