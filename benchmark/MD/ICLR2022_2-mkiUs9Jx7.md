# ABSTRACT

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) with clustered latent spaces can perform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. In the real world, the salient attributes of unlabeled data can be imbalanced. However, existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot cluster attributes of these data in their latent spaces properly because they assume uniform distributions of the attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically derive Stein latent optimization that provides reparameterizable gradient estimations of the latent distribution parameters assuming a Gaussian mixture prior in a continuous latent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder network and novel unsupervised conditional contrastive loss to ensure that data generated from a single mixture component represent a single attribute. We confirm that the proposed method, named Stein Latent Optimization for GANs (SLOGAN), successfully learns balanced or imbalanced attributes and achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised conditional generation performance even in the absence of attribute information (e.g., the imbalance ratio). Moreover, we demonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated using a small amount of probe data.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

GANs have shown remarkable results in the synthesis of realistic data conditioned on a specific class (Odena et al., 2017; Miyato & Koyama, 2018; Kang & Park, 2020). Training conditional GANs requires a massive amount of labeled data; however, data are often unlabeled or possess only a few labels. For unsupervised conditional generation, the salient attributes of the data are first identified by unsupervised learning and used for conditional generation of data. Recently, several unsupervised conditional GANs have been proposed (Chen et al., 2016; Mukherjee et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2021). By maximizing a lower bound of mutual information between latent codes and generated data, they cluster the attributes of the underlying data distribution in their latent spaces. These GANs achieve satisfactory performance when the salient attributes of data are balanced.

However, the attributes of real-world data can be imbalanced. For example, in the CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015), the number of examples with one attribute (not wearing eyeglasses) outnumberers the other attribute (wearing eyeglasses). Similarly, the number of examples with disease-related attributes in a biomedical dataset might be miniscule (Hwang et al., 2019). Thus, the imbalanced nature of real-world attributes must be considered for unsupervised conditional generation. Existing unsupervised conditional GANs are not suitable for real-world attributes, because they assume balanced attributes if the imbalance ratio is unknown. Examples where existing methods fail to learn imbalanced attributes are shown in Figure 1 (a), (b) and (c).

In this paper, we propose unsupervised conditional GANs, referred to as Stein Latent Optimization for GANs (SLOGAN). We define the latent distribution of the GAN models as Gaussian mixtures to enable the imbalanced attributes to be naturally clustered in a continuous latent space. We derive reparameterizable gradient identities for the mean vectors, full covariance matrices, and mixing coefficients of the latent distribution using Stein's lemma. This enables stable learning and makes latent distribution parameters, including the mixing coefficient, learnable. We then devise a GAN framework with an encoder network and an unsupervised conditional contrastive loss (U2C loss), which can interact well with the learnable Gaussian mixture prior (Figure 2). This framework facilitates the association of data generated from a Gaussian component with a single attribute.

(d) SLOGAN (Ours)

For the synthetic dataset, our method (Figure 1 (d)) shows superior performance on unsupervised conditional generation, with the accurately learned mixing coefficients. We performed experiments on various real-world datasets including MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), Fashion-MNIST (Xiao et al., 2017), CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), CelebA (Liu et al., 2015), and CelebA-HQ (Karras et al., 2017) using architectures such as DCGAN (Radford et al., 2016), ResGAN (Gulrajani et al., 2017), and StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2020). Through experiments, we verified that the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised conditional GANs in unsupervised conditional generation on datasets with balanced or imbalanced attributes. Furthermore, we confirmed that we could control the attributes to be learned when a small set of probe data is provided.

The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:

- We propose novel Stein Latent Optimization for GANs (SLOGAN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that can perform unsupervised conditional generation by considering the imbalanced attributes of real-world data.  
- To enable this, we derive the implicit reparameterization for Gaussian mixture prior using Stein's lemma. Then, we devise a GAN framework with an encoder and an unsupervised conditional contrastive loss (U2C loss) suitable for implicit reparameterization.  
- SLOGAN significantly outperforms the existing methods on unsupervised learning tasks, such as cluster assignment, unconditional data generation, and unsupervised conditional generation, on datasets that include balanced or imbalanced attributes.

# 2 BACKGROUND

# 2.1 GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS

Unsupervised conditional generation Several models including InfoGAN (Chen et al., 2016), ClusterGAN (Mukherjee et al., 2019), and CD-GAN (Pan et al., 2021) have been proposed to perform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. However, these models primarily have two drawbacks: (1) Most of these methods embed the attributes in discrete variables, which induces discontinuity among the embedded attributes. (2) They assume uniform distributions of the attributes, and thus fail to learn the imbalance in attributes when the imbalance ratio is not provided. By contrast, our work addresses the aforementioned limitations by combining GANs with the gradient estimation of the Gaussian mixture prior via Stein's lemma and representation learning on the latent space.

GANs with Gaussian mixture prior DeLiGAN (Gurumurthy et al., 2017) is analogous to the proposed method, as it assumes a Gaussian mixture prior and learns the mean vectors and covariance matrices via the reparameterization trick. However, DeLiGAN assumes uniform mixing coefficients without updating them. As a result, it fails to perform unsupervised conditional generation on datasets with imbalanced attributes. In addition, it uses the explicit reparameterization trick, which inevitably suffers from high variance in the estimated gradients. This will be discussed further in Section 2.3.

Figure 2: Overview of the SLOGAN model. Here,  $\mathbf{x}_g$  denotes the data generated from a latent vector  $\mathbf{z}$ ,  $\mathbf{x}_r$  is a real data that is used for adversarial learning, and  $C$  indicates a component ID of the Gaussian mixture prior with the highest responsibility  $\operatorname{argmax}_c q(c|\mathbf{z})$ .

# 2.2 CONTRASTIVE LEARNING

Contrastive learning aims to learn representations by contrasting neighboring with non- neighboring instances (Hadsell et al., 2006). In general, contrastive loss is defined as a critic function that approximates the log density ratio  $\log p(y|x) / p(y)$  of two random variables  $X$  and  $Y$ . By minimizing the loss, the lower bound of the mutual information  $I(X;Y)$  is approximately maximized (Poole et al., 2019). Several studies have shown that contrastive losses are advantageous for the representation learning of imbalanced data (Kang et al., 2021; 2020; Wanyan et al., 2021). Motivated by these observations, we propose a contrastive loss that cooperates with a learnable latent distribution.

# 2.3 GRADIENT ESTIMATION FOR GAUSSIAN MIXTURE

Stein's lemma Stein's lemma provides a first-order gradient identity for a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The univariate case of Stein's lemma can be described as follows:

Lemma 1. Let function  $h(\cdot) : \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  be continuously differentiable.  $q(z)$  is a univariate Gaussian distribution parameterized by the mean  $\mu$  and variance  $\sigma$ . Then, the following identity holds:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {q (z)} \left[ \sigma^ {- 1} (z - \mu) h (z) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {q (z)} \left[ \nabla_ {z} h (z) \right] \tag {1}
$$

Lin et al. (2019b) generalized Stein's lemma to exponential family mixtures and linked it to the implicit reparameterization trick. Stein's lemma has been applied to various fields of deep learning, including Bayesian deep learning (Lin et al., 2019a) and adversarial robustness (Wang et al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to apply Stein's lemma to GANs.

Reparameterization trick A simple method to estimate gradients of the parameters of Gaussian mixtures is explicit reparameterization, used in DeLiGAN. When the  $c$ -th component is selected according to the mixing coefficient  $p(c)$ , the latent variable is calculated as follows:  $\mathbf{z} = \boldsymbol{\mu}_c + \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \cdot \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_c^{1/2}$  where  $\boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$ . Derivatives of a loss function  $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(z)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\mu}}$  and  $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(z)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$  only update the mean and covariance matrices of the selected ( $c$ -th) component  $\boldsymbol{\mu}_c$  and  $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_c$ , respectively. Gradient estimation using explicit reparameterization is unbiased; however, it has a distinctly high variance. For a single latent vector  $\mathbf{z}$ , the implicit reparameterization trick (Figurnov et al., 2018) updates the parameters of all the latent components. Gradient estimation using implicit reparameterization is unbiased and has a lower variance, which enables a more stable and faster convergence of the model. The gradients for the parameters of the Gaussian mixture prior in our method are implicitly reparameterizable.

# 3 PROPOSED METHOD

In the following sections, we propose Stein Latent Optimization for GANs (SLOGAN). We assume a Gaussian mixture prior (Section 3.1), derive implicit reparameterization of the parameters of the mixture prior (Section 3.2), and construct a GAN framework with U2C loss (Section 3.3).

Additionally, we devise a method to manipulate attributes to be learned if necessary (Section 3.4). An overview of SLOGAN is shown in Figure 2.

# 3.1 GAUSSIAN MIXTURE PRIOR

We consider a GAN with a generator  $G:\mathbb{R}^{d_z}\mapsto \mathbb{R}^{d_x}$  and a discriminator  $D:\mathbb{R}^{d_x}\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ , where  $d_{z}$  and  $d_{x}$  are the dimensions of latent and data spaces, respectively. In the latent space  $\mathcal{Z}\in \mathbb{R}^{d_z}$ , we consider a conditional latent distribution  $q(\mathbf{z}|c) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z};\pmb {\mu}_c,\Sigma_c)$ ,  $c = 1,\dots,K$ , where  $K$  is the number of components we initially set and  $\pmb{\mu}_{c},\Sigma_{c}$  are the mean vector and covariance matrix of the  $c$ -th component, respectively. Subsequently, we consider a Gaussian mixture  $q(\mathbf{z}) = \sum_{c = 1}^{K}p(c)q(\mathbf{z}|c)$  parameterized by  $\pmb {\mu} = \{\pmb {\mu}_c\}_{c = 1}^K$ $\pmb {\Sigma} = \{\Sigma_c\}_{c = 1}^K$  and  $\pi = \{\pi_c\}_{c = 1}^K = \{p(c)\}_{c = 1}^K$  as the prior.

We hypothesize that a mixture prior in a continuous space could model some continuous attributes of real-world data (e.g., hair color) more naturally than categorical priors which could introduce discontinuity (Mukherjee et al., 2019). Because we use implicit reparameterization of a mixture of Gaussian priors (derived in Section 3.2), SLOGAN can fully benefit from implicit reparameterization and U2C loss. By contrast, the implicit reparameterization of prior distributions that do not belong to the exponential family (e.g., categorical priors) remains an open question.

In the experiments, the elements of  $\mu_{c}$  were sampled from  $\mathcal{N}(0,0.1)$ , and we selected  $\Sigma_{c} = I$  and  $\pi_c = 1 / K$  as the initial values. For the convenience of notation, we define the latent distribution  $q = q(\mathbf{z})$ , the mixing coefficient  $\pi_c = p(c)$ , and  $\delta (\mathbf{z}) = \{\delta (\mathbf{z})_c\}_{c = 1}^K$ , where  $\delta (\mathbf{z})_c = q(\mathbf{z}|c) / q(\mathbf{z})$ .  $q(c|\mathbf{z})$ , the responsibility of component  $c$  for a latent vector  $\mathbf{z}$ , can be expressed as follows:

$$
q (c | \mathbf {z}) = \frac {q (c , \mathbf {z})}{q (\mathbf {z})} = \frac {q (\mathbf {z} | c) p (c)}{q (\mathbf {z})} = \delta (\mathbf {z}) _ {c} \pi_ {c} \tag {2}
$$

# 3.2 GRADIENT IDENTITIES

We present gradient identities for the latent distribution parameters. To derive the identities, we use the generalized Stein's lemma for Gaussian mixtures with full covariance matrices (Lin et al., 2019b). First, we derive a gradient identity for the mean vector using Bonnet's theorem (Bonnet, 1964).

Theorem 1. Given an expected loss of the generator  $\mathcal{L}$  and a loss function for a sample  $\ell(\cdot): \mathbb{R}^{d_z} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ , we assume  $\ell$  to be continuously differentiable. Then, the following identity holds:

$$
\nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\mu} _ {c}} \mathcal {L} = \mathbb {E} _ {q} [ \delta (\mathbf {z}) _ {c} \pi_ {c} \nabla_ {\mathbf {z}} \ell (\mathbf {z}) ] \tag {3}
$$

Proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix B.1.

We derive a gradient identity for the covariance matrix via Price's theorem (Price, 1958). Among the two versions of the Price's theorem, we use the first-order identity to minimize computational cost.

Theorem 2. With the same assumptions as in Theorem 1, the following gradient identity holds:

$$
\nabla_ {\Sigma_ {c}} \mathcal {L} = \frac {1}{2} \mathbb {E} _ {q} \left[ \delta (\mathbf {z}) _ {c} \pi_ {c} \Sigma_ {c} ^ {- 1} \left(\mathbf {z} - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {c}\right) \nabla_ {\mathbf {z}} ^ {T} \ell (\mathbf {z}) \right] \tag {4}
$$

Proof of Theorem 2 is given in Appendix B.2. In the implementation, we replaced the expectation of the right-hand side of Equation 4 with the average for a batch of latent vectors; hence, the updated  $\Sigma_{c}$  may not be symmetric or positive-definite. To force a valid covariance matrix, we modify the updates of the covariance matrix as follows:

$$
\Delta \Sigma_ {c} = - \nabla_ {\Sigma_ {c}} \mathcal {L} = - \frac {1}{2} \mathbb {E} _ {q} \left[ \frac {1}{2} \left(S _ {\mathbf {z}} + S _ {\mathbf {z}} ^ {T}\right) \right] \tag {5}
$$

$$
\Delta \Sigma_ {c} ^ {\prime} = \Delta \Sigma_ {c} + \frac {\gamma}{2} \Delta \Sigma_ {c} \Sigma_ {c} ^ {- 1} \Delta \Sigma_ {c} \tag {6}
$$

where  $S_{\mathbf{z}} = \delta (\mathbf{z})_c\pi_c\Sigma_c^{-1}(\mathbf{z} - \boldsymbol {\mu}_c)\nabla_{\mathbf{z}}^T\ell (\mathbf{z})$  , and  $\gamma$  denotes the learning rate for  $\Sigma_{c}$  . Equation 5 holds as  $\Delta \Sigma_{c} = \frac{1}{2} E_{q}[S_{\mathbf{z}}] = \frac{1}{2} E_{q}[S_{\mathbf{z}}^{T}]$  . Motivated by Lin et al. (2020), Equation 6 ensures the positive-definiteness of the covariance matrix, which is proved by Theorem 3.

Theorem 3. The updated covariance matrix  $\Sigma_c' = \Sigma_c + \gamma \Delta \Sigma_c'$  with the modified update rule specified in Equation 6 is positive-definite if  $\Sigma_c$  is positive-definite.

Proof of Theorem 3 is provided in Appendix B.3.

We introduce a mixing coefficient parameter  $\rho_{c}$ , which is updated instead of the mixing coefficient  $\pi_{c}$ , to guarantee that the updated mixing coefficients are non-negative and summed to one.  $\pi_{c}$  can be calculated using the softmax function (i.e.,  $\pi_{c} = \exp (\rho_{c}) / \sum_{i = 1}^{K}\exp (\rho_{i})$ ). We can then derive the gradient identity for the mixing coefficient parameter as follows:

Theorem 4. Let  $\rho_c$  be a mixing coefficient parameter. Then, the following gradient identity holds:

$$
\nabla_ {\rho_ {c}} \mathcal {L} = \mathbb {E} _ {q} \left[ \pi_ {c} (\delta (\mathbf {z}) _ {c} - 1) \ell (\mathbf {z}) \right] \tag {7}
$$

Proof of Theorem 4 is given in Appendix B.4. Because the gradients of the latent vector with respect to the latent parameters are computed by implicit differentiation via Stein's lemma, we obtain the implicit reparameterization gradients introduced in Figurnov et al. (2018).

# 3.3 CONTRASTIVE LEARNING

We introduce new unsupervised conditional contrastive loss (U2C loss) to learn salient attributes from data and to facilitate unsupervised conditional generation. We consider a batch of latent vectors  $\{\mathbf{z}^i\}_{i=1}^B \sim q(\mathbf{z})$ , where  $B$  is the batch size. Generator  $G$  receives the  $i$ -th latent vector  $\mathbf{z}^i$  and generates data  $\mathbf{x}_g^i = G(\mathbf{z}^i)$ . The adversarial loss for  $G$  with respect to the sample  $\mathbf{z}^i$  is as follows:

$$
\ell_ {\mathrm {a d v}} \left(\mathbf {z} ^ {i}\right) = - D \left(G \left(\mathbf {z} ^ {i}\right)\right) \tag {8}
$$

We also introduce an encoder network  $E$  to implement U2C loss. The synthesized data  $\mathbf{x}_g^i$  enters  $E$ , and  $E$  generates an encoded vector  $\mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{x}}^i = E(\mathbf{x}_g^i)$ . Then, we find the mean vector  $\boldsymbol{\mu}_C^i$ , where  $C$  is the component ID with the highest responsibility  $q(c|\mathbf{z}^i)$ . We calculate  $C$  first because a generated sample should have the attribute of the most responsible component among multiple components in the continuous space. Second, to update the parameters of the prior using implicit reparameterization, the loss should be a function of a latent vector  $\mathbf{z}^i$ , as proved in Theorems 1, 2, and 4. The component ID for each sample is calculated as follows:

$$
C ^ {i} = \underset {c} {\operatorname {a r g m a x}} q (c | \mathbf {z} ^ {i}) = \underset {c} {\operatorname {a r g m a x}} \delta (\mathbf {z} ^ {i}) _ {c} \pi_ {c} \tag {9}
$$

where  $q(c|\mathbf{z}^i) = \delta (\mathbf{z}^i)_c\pi_c$  is derived from Equation 2. To satisfy the assumption of the continuously differentiable loss function in Theorems 1 and 2, we adopt the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation (Jang et al., 2017), instead of the argmax function. We use  $\pmb{\mu}_{\mathbf{C}}^{i} = \sum_{c = 1}^{K}\mathbf{C}_{c}^{i}\pmb{\mu}_{c}$  to calculate U2C loss

to ensure that the loss function is continuously differentiable with respect to  $\mathbf{z}^i$ , where  $\mathbf{C}^i = \mathrm{Gumbel-Softmax}_{\tau}(\delta(\mathbf{z}^i)\pmb{\pi})$  and  $\tau = 0.01$ . We derive U2C loss as follows:

$$
\ell_ {\mathrm {U} 2 \mathrm {C}} (\mathbf {z} ^ {i}) = - \log \frac {\exp (\cos \theta_ {i i})}{\frac {1}{B} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {B} \exp (\cos \theta_ {i j})} \tag {10}
$$

where we select the cosine similarity between  $\mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{x}}^{i}$  and  $\pmb{\mu}_{\mathbf{C}}^{j}$ ,  $\cos \theta_{ij} = \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{x}}^{i} \cdot \pmb{\mu}_{\mathbf{C}}^{j} / \| \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{x}}^{i} \| \| \pmb{\mu}_{\mathbf{C}}^{j} \|$  as the critic function that approximates the log density ratio  $\log p(C^j | \mathbf{x}_g^i) / p(C^j)$  for contrastive learning. Given a test data, the probability for each cluster can be calculated using the assumption of the critic function, which enables us to assign a cluster for the data. Cluster assignment is described in Appendix C.2.

Intuitively, a mean vector  $\mu_{\mathbf{C}}^{i}$  of a latent mixture component is regarded as a prototype of each attribute. U2C loss encourages the encoded vector  $\mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{x}}^{i}$  of the generated sample to be similar to their assigned low-dimensional prototypes  $\mu_{\mathbf{C}}^{i}$  in the latent space. This allows each salient attribute clusters in the latent space, and each component of the learned latent distribution is responsible for a certain attribute of the data. If  $\cos \theta_{ii}$  is proportional to the log density ratio  $\log p(C^i |\mathbf{x}_g^i) / p(C^i)$ , minimizing U2C loss in Equation 10 is equivalent to maximizing the lower bound of the mutual information  $I(C^{i};\mathbf{x}_{g}^{i})$ , as discussed by Poole et al. (2019) and Zhong et al. (2020).

$G$  and  $E$  are trained to minimize  $\frac{1}{B}\sum_{i = 1}^{B}\left(\ell_{\mathrm{adv}}(\mathbf{z}^i) + \lambda \ell_{\mathrm{U2C}}(\mathbf{z}^i)\right)$ , where  $\lambda$  denotes the coefficient of U2C loss. Both  $\mu$  and  $\Sigma$  are learned by substituting  $\ell_{\mathrm{adv}}(\mathbf{z}^i) + \lambda \ell_{\mathrm{U2C}}(\mathbf{z}^i)$  into  $\ell$  of Equations 3 and 6, respectively. When U2C loss is used to update  $\pi$ , U2C loss hinders  $\pi$  from estimating the imbalance ratio of attributes in the data well, which is discussed in Appendix A.3 with a detailed explanation and an empirical result. Therefore,  $\rho$ , from which  $\pi$  is calculated, uses only the adversarial loss, and  $\ell$  of Equation 7 is substituted by  $\ell_{\mathrm{adv}}(\mathbf{z}^i)$ .  $\mu$ ,  $\Sigma$  and  $\rho$  are learned using a batch average of estimated gradients, which is referred to as stochastic gradient estimation, instead of expectation over the latent distribution  $q$ . The entire training procedure of SLOGAN is presented in Algorithm 1.

To help that the latent space does not learn low-level attributes, such as background color, we additionally used the SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) loss on the generated data with DiffAugment (Zhao et al., 2020) to train the encoder on colored image datasets. Methodological details and discussion on SimCLR are presented in Appendix C.4 and A.3, respectively.

# 3.4 ATTRIBUTE MANIPULATION

For datasets such as face attributes, a data point can have multiple attributes simultaneously. To learn a desired attribute from such data, a probe dataset  $\{\mathbf{x}_{c}^{i}\}_{i = 1}^{M}$  for the  $c$ -th latent component, which consists of  $M$  data points with the desired attribute, can be utilized. We propose the following loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {m}} = \frac {1}{M} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {M} - \log \frac {\exp \left(\cos \theta_ {c} ^ {i}\right)}{\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \exp \left(\cos \theta_ {k} ^ {i}\right)} \tag {11}
$$

where  $\cos \theta_{k}^{i} = E(\mathbf{x}_{c}^{i})\cdot \pmb{\mu}_{k} / \| E(\mathbf{x}_{c}^{i})\| \| \pmb{\mu}_{k}\|$  is the cosine similarity between  $E(\mathbf{x}_c^i)$  and  $\pmb{\mu}_k$ . Our model manipulates attributes by minimizing  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{m}}$  for  $\pmb {\mu},\pmb {\Sigma},G,$  and  $E$ . In addition, mixup (Zhang et al., 2018) can be used to better learn attributes from a small probe dataset. The advantage of SLOGAN in attribute manipulation is that it can learn imbalanced attributes even if the attributes in the probe dataset are balanced, and perform better conditional generation. The detailed procedure of attribute manipulation is described in Appendix C.3.

# 4.1 DATASETS

We used the MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST) (Xiao et al., 2017), CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), CelebA (Liu et al., 2015) (cropped and resized to  $64 \times 64$ ), and CelebA-HQ (Karras et al., 2017) (resized to  $128 \times 128$  and  $256 \times 256$ ) datasets to evaluate the proposed method. We also constructed some datasets with imbalanced attribute. For example, we used two classes of the MNIST dataset (0 vs. 4, referred to as MNIST-2), two classes of the CIFAR-10 dataset (frogs vs. planes, referred to as CIFAR-2), and five clusters of the FMNIST dataset ( $\{\text{Trouser}\}$ ,

Although SLOGAN and other methods do not utilize labels for training, the data in experimental settings have labels predefined by humans. We consider that each class of dataset contains a distinct attribute. Thus, the model performance was measured using classes of datasets. The number of latent components or the dimension of the discrete latent code  $(K)$  was set as the number of classes of data.

# 4.2 EVALUATION METRICS

The performance of our method was evaluated quantitatively in three aspects: (1) whether the model could learn distinct attributes and cluster real data (i.e., cluster assignment), which is evaluated using normalized mutual information (NMI) (Mukherjee et al., 2019), (2) whether the overall data distribution  $p(\mathbf{x}_r)$  could be estimated (i.e., unconditional data generation), which is measured using the Fréchet inception distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017), and, most importantly, (3) whether the data distribution for each attribute  $p(\mathbf{x}_r|c)$  could be estimated (i.e., unsupervised conditional generation).

For unsupervised conditional generation, it is important to account for intra-cluster diversity as well as the quality of the generated samples. We introduce a modified version of FID named intra-cluster Fréchet inception distance (ICFID) described in Algorithm 2. We calculate FIDs between the real data of each class and generated data from each latent code (a mixture component for DeLiGAN and SLOGAN, and a category for other methods). We then greedily match a latent code with a class of real data with the smallest FID. We define ICFID as the average FID between the matched pairs and use it as an evaluation metric for unsupervised conditional generation. ICFID additionally provides class-cluster assignment (i.e., which cluster is the closest to the class).

# 4.3 EVALUATION RESULTS

We compared SLOGAN with WGAN (Arjovsky et al., 2017), InfoGAN (Chen et al., 2016), DeLiGAN (Gurumurthy et al., 2017), ClusterGAN (Mukherjee et al., 2019), CD-GAN (Pan et al., 2021). Following Mukherjee et al. (2019), we used k-means clustering on the encoder outputs of the test data to calculate NMI. WGAN and DeLiGAN have no encoder network; hence the pre-activation of the penultimate layer of  $D$  was used for the clustering metrics. For a fair comparison, we also compared DeLiGAN with an encoder network (referred to as DeLiGAN+). We could not measure ICFID of WGAN because it cannot perform unsupervised conditional generation. The same network architecture and hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate) were used across all methods for comparison. Details of the experiments and DeLiGAN+ are presented in Appendices D and C.5, respectively.

Balanced attributes We compare SLOGAN with existing unsupervised conditional GANs on datasets with balanced attributes. As shown in Table 1 (The complete version is given in Appendix A.1.), SLOGAN outperformed other GANs across all datasets and evaluation metrics. Comparisons with methods with categorical priors (ClusterGAN and CD-GAN) verified the advantages of the mixture priors. The samples generated from each latent component of SLOGAN can be found in Appendix A.6.

Imbalanced attributes We compare SLOGAN with existing methods on datasets with imbalanced attributes in Table 2 (The complete version is presented in Appendix A.2). ICFIDs of our method, which can learn the mixing coefficients, are much better than those of other methods, which cannot learn the mixing coefficients. This indicates that SLOGAN was able to robustly capture the minority attributes in datasets and can generate data conditioned on the learned attributes. In CIFAR-2 (7:3), the ratio of frog and plane is 7 to 3 and the estimated  $\pi$  is  $(0.69 \pm 0.02, 0.31 \pm 0.02)$ , which are very close to the ground-truth (0.7, 0.3). Figure 3 (a) shows the images generated from each latent component of SLOGAN on CIFAR-2 (7:3).

Performance with respect to imbalance ratio We compared the performance of SLOGAN with competitive benchmarks (ClusterGAN and CD-GAN) by changing the imbalance ratios of CIFAR-2 from 9:1 to 1:9. SLOGAN showed higher performance than the benchmarks on cluster assignment (Figure 4 (a)) and unsupervised conditional generation (Figure 4 (b)) for all imbalance ratios. Furthermore, our method shows a larger gap in ICFID with the benchmarks when the ratio of planes is low. This implies that SLOGAN works robustly in situations in which the attributes of data are highly imbalanced. We conducted additional experiments including interpolation in the latent space, benefits of ICFID. The results of the additional experiments and generated images are shown in Appendix A.

# 4.4 ABLATION STUDY

U2C loss Table 3 shows the benefit of U2C loss on several datasets. Low-level features (e.g., color) of the CIFAR dataset differ depending on the class, which enables SLOGAN to function to some extent without U2C loss on CIFAR-10. In the MNIST dataset, the colors of the background (black) and object (white) are the same, and only the shape of objects differs depending on the class. U2C loss played an essential role on MNIST (7:3). The modes of the Synthetic dataset (Figure 1) are placed adjacent to each other, and SLOGAN cannot function on this dataset without U2C loss. From the results, we observed that the effectiveness of U2C loss depends on the properties of the datasets.

Implicit reparameterization To show the advantage of implicit over explicit reparameterization, we implemented DeLiGAN with U2C loss by applying explicit reparameterization on  $\mu$  and  $\Sigma$ . Because the mixing coefficient cannot be updated with explicit reparameterization to the best of our knowledge, we also implemented DeLiGAN with U2C loss and implicit reparameterization on  $\rho$  using Equation 7. In Table 4, SLOGAN using implicit reparameterization outperformed explicit reparameterization. When implicit  $\rho$  update was added, the prior collapsed into a single component  $(\pi_{y=0} = 1)$  and ICFID increased. The lower variance of implicit reparameterized gradients prevents the prior from collapsing into a single component and improves the performance. Additional ablation studies and discussions are presented in Appendix A.

# 4.5 EFFECTS OF PROBE DATA

CelebA + ResGAN We demonstrate that SLOGAN can learn the desired attributes using a small amount of probe data. Among multiple attributes which co-exist in the CelebA dataset, we chose Male (1:1) and Eyeglasses (14:1). We randomly selected 30 probe images for each latent component.  $\pi_{y=0}$  represents the learned mixing coefficient that correspond to latent components associated with faces without the attribute. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 5, we observed that SLOGAN learned the desired attributes. Additional experiments on attribute manipulation are presented in Appendix A.3.

CelebA-HQ + StyleGAN2 StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2020) differs from other GANs in that the latent vectors are used for style. Despite this difference, the implicit reparameterization and U2C loss can be applied to the input space of the mapping network. On CelebA-HQ datasets with resolutions of  $128 \times 128$  and  $256 \times 256$ , we used 30 male and 30 female faces as probe data. As shown in Figure 3 (b), our method successfully performed unsupervised conditional generation on high-resolution images and a recent architecture, even simultaneously with imbalanced attributes.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We have proposed a method called SLOGAN to generate data conditioned on learned attributes on real-world datasets with balanced or imbalanced attributes. We derive implicit reparameterization for the parameters of the latent distribution. We then proposed a GAN framework and unsupervised conditional contrastive loss (U2C loss). We verified that SLOGAN achieved state-of-the-art unsupervised conditional generation performance. In addition, a small amount of probe data helps SLOGAN control attributes. In future work, we will consider a principled method to learn the number and hierarchy of attributes in real-world data. In addition, improving the quality of samples with minority attributes is an important avenue for future research on unsupervised conditional GANs.
