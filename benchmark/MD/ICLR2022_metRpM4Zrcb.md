# ABSTRACT

Continual learning is widely studied in recent years to resolve the catastrophic forgetting of deep neural networks. In this paper, we first enforce a low-rank filter subspace by decomposing convolutional filters within each network layer over a small set of filter atoms. Then, we perform continual learning with filter atom swapping. In other words, we learn for each task a new filter subspace for each convolutional layer, i.e., hundreds of parameters as filter atoms, but keep subspace coefficients shared across tasks. By maintaining a small footprint memory of filter atoms, we can easily archive models for past tasks to avoid forgetting. The effectiveness of this simple scheme for continual learning is illustrated both empirically and theoretically. The proposed atom swapping framework further enables flexible and efficient model ensemble with members selected within task or across tasks to improve the performance in different continual learning settings. The proposed method can be applied to a wide range of optimization schemes and convolutional network structures. Being validated on multiple benchmark datasets, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and scalability.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Humans keep acquiring new concepts without forgetting the past. To endow intelligent agents with the same ability of long-term knowledge accumulation, continual learning (CL) has been intensively studied in recent years. In continual learning, an agent learns from a sequence of tasks, with the goal of gaining knowledge of each new task while preserving the capacity for resolving the old ones, therefore to avoid catastrophic forgetting. The recent advances of CL mainly follow several directions. One popular category among them is to maintain an external memory of the original images (Robins, 1995; Rebuffi et al., 2017), synthesized images (Shin et al., 2017), or parameter gradients (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017) for archiving the past. These memory-based methods often suffer from heavy memory footprints, while still forgetting about the previous tasks to some extent.

Motivated by the literature on subspace modeling of tasks (Evgeniou & Pontil, 2007; Maurer et al., 2013; Zhang & Yang, 2021; Romera-Paredes et al., 2013; Kumar & Daume III, 2012), in this paper, we propose to learn for each task a new filter subspace for each convolutional layer, i.e., hundreds of parameters as filter atoms, but keep subspace coefficients shared across tasks. In other words, in a CNN, we enforce a low-rank filter subspace by decomposing convolutional filters within each network layer over a small set of filter atoms. Then, we perform continual learning by simply swapping filter atoms for each task. The effectiveness of our approach is empirically validated and further explained theoretically with an excess risk bound analysis.

With the proposed approach, we can faithfully remember the past by only maintaining a small footprint atom memory to archive task-specific filter atoms. Any previously learned CNN models can now be exactly recovered by multiplying the task-shared coefficients with the task-specific atoms, which can be retrieved efficiently from the atom memory. Thus, the introduced filter atom memory permits historical knowledge to be recalled with a guarantee against forgetting. While comparing with state-of-the-art memory-based CL methods, our approach requires only storing for each task some tiny size of filter atoms, which in total are typically much smaller than the size of exemplars in most memory-based methods (Rebuffi et al., 2017; Prabhu et al., 2020), and therefore potentially supports continual learning on a large scale.

Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed continual learning method with filter atom swapping. Within each CNN layer, we decompose a filter  $\mathbf{W}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times c' \times k \times k}$  over a filter subspace characterized by  $m$  filter atoms  $\mathbf{D}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k \times k}$  as  $\mathbf{W}_i = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i\mathbf{D}_i$ , where  $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times c' \times m}$  are the subspace coefficients,  $c$  and  $c'$  are the number of input and output channels,  $k$  is the spatial size of each atom. With task-shared coefficients, we learn for each task a new filter subspace as filter atoms, and store those atoms, typically a few hundred of parameters, in a small footprint atom memory. At time  $T$ , we can recall the past model at  $t$  ( $t < T$ ) through filter reconstruction  $\mathbf{W}_i^t = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i\mathbf{D}_i^t$ , with  $\mathbf{D}_i^t$  fetched from the atom memory, to fully recover the previous model.

Our atom swapping continual learning framework can effectively support both inter-task and intra-task model ensemble to further enhance performance in different continual learning settings: First, inter-task ensemble utilizes the relevant past knowledge to boost the present task performance. To ensure that ensemble with past models can affect the current task positively, we only select a relevant subset of past models. With a life-long learning scenario in mind, we choose to assess task relevancy simply based on the filter subspace distance, which can be on-the-fly computed here via the Grassmann distance (Absil et al., 2004) among task-specific filter subspaces. Second, intra-task ensemble can be adopted in class-incremental setting to help task prediction with the minimal-entropy criterion. Usually, ensemble members are instantiated as independent CNNs, and their learning and inference are conducted separately for dissimilarity. However, this will lead to significant increase in training and inference time and memory usage. We address this problem by creating within a task multiple virtual members in a single CNN model by simply maintaining several groups of filter atoms in each layer. In this way, different intra-task members are integrated into a single network, and its learning and inference can be conducted efficiently with group convolution.

We validate our simple yet effective approach on several continual learning benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR100, and miniImageNet using both class-incremental and task-incremental settings, and observe competitive results against state-of-the-art methods on all benchmarks with far less memory usage.

We summarize our contributions as follows,

- We learn for each task a new filter subspace for each layer, and keep subspace coefficients shared across tasks.  
- We maintain a small footprint filter atom memory that can faithfully archive past knowledge with a guarantee against forgetting in a highly scalable way.  
- We adopt inter-task ensemble for the present task by recalling past models based on an on-the-fly calculated task relevancy in task-incremental settings.  
- We propose intra-task ensemble for class-incremental settings by creating multiple virtual members in a single CNN model through different groups of filter atoms per layer.

# 2 MOTIVATION

We are motivated by the literature on task subspace modeling (Evgeniou & Pontil, 2007; Maurer et al., 2013; Zhang & Yang, 2021; Romera-Paredes et al., 2013; Kumar & Daume III, 2012), where it is commonly assumed that task parameters lie in a low dimensional subspace, so that tasks can be modeled as a set of latent basis tasks and their linear combinations. The latent basis tasks and

the respective linear combinations are often obtained via alternative optimization by fixing one and optimizing the other (Kumar & Daume III, 2012).

In our continual learning setting, we model tasks using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Following (Qiu et al., 2018), we decompose a convolutional filter  $\mathbf{W}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times c' \times k \times k}$  for the  $i$ -th layer over  $m$  filter atoms  $\mathbf{D}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k \times k}$ , linearly combined by coefficient  $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times c' \times m}$ , where  $c$  and  $c'$  are the number of input and output channels,  $k$  is the spatial size of each atom. This can be written as  $\mathbf{W}_i = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i \times \mathbf{D}_i$ . Note that this decomposition distributes a filter  $\mathbf{W}_i$  into two imbalanced parts:  $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i$  for channel mixing with  $mcc'$  parameters, and light-weight  $\mathbf{D}_i$  for spatial filtering with only  $mk^2$  entries. In all, we use  $\mathbf{W} = \boldsymbol{\alpha} \times \mathbf{D}$  to denote the filters decomposition in a model with  $l$  convolutional layers, where  $\mathbf{W} = \{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^l$ ,  $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = \{\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i\}_{i=1}^l$ ,  $\mathbf{D} = \{\mathbf{D}_i\}_{i=1}^l$  indicate all filters, coefficients, and atoms respectively.

It is easy to observe that, within each CNN layer, we can borrow from the task subspace modeling methodology by creating a set of latent basis tasks through filter atoms  $\mathbf{D}_i$  and their linear combinations as atom coefficients  $\alpha_{i}$ . The linear combination coefficients  $\alpha_{i}$  are learned on the first task jointly with the first group of atoms, and then atoms for subsequent tasks are alternatively optimized by fixing  $\alpha_{i}$ .

As illustrated in the subsequent sections, this seemingly under-fitting method not only enables an efficient way to faithfully archive past models with a guarantee against forgetting, but also supports efficient inter-task and intra-task model ensemble to further improve the performance.

# 3 METHODOLOGY

We consider the problem of learning  $T$  tasks sequentially. Formally, we denote the data distribution that associates with the  $t$ -th task as  $\mathcal{D}^t = (\mathcal{X}^t,\mathcal{Y}^t)$ ,  $t\in \{1,2,\dots,T\}$ , from which a dataset  $D^{t} = \{\mathbf{x}_{t}^{i},\mathbf{y}_{t}^{i}\}_{i = 1}^{N_{t}}$  is sampled for training. The goal of continual learning is to minimize the statistical risk of all seen tasks given no access to data  $D^t$  from previous tasks  $t\leq T$  (Delange et al., 2021):

$$
\sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \mathbb {E} _ {\left(\mathcal {X} ^ {t}, \mathcal {Y} ^ {t}\right)} \left[ \mathcal {L} \left(\mathcal {F} ^ {t} \left(\mathcal {X} ^ {t}; \theta\right), \mathcal {Y} ^ {t}\right) \right], \tag {1}
$$

where  $\mathcal{L}$  denotes the risk function,  $\mathcal{F}^t (\cdot ;\theta)$  is the model for task  $t$  with parameter  $\theta$ . Continual learning with a guarantee against forgetting can be achieved by storing learned parameters entirely in an external memory  $\mathcal{M} = \{\theta^t\}_{t = 1}^T$  given  $\mathcal{F}^t (\cdot ;\theta) = \mathcal{F}(\cdot ;\theta^t)$ , thus any previous model can be completely recovered by retrieving the corresponding parameters from the memory. However, such a straightforward solution based on parameter memory suffers severely on its poor scalability due to the large size of modern deep neural networks and the potentially long task sequence. We address the scalability issue and achieve guaranteed non-forgetting by decomposing convolutional filters in a CNN into task-specific filter atoms and task-shared coefficients. Then only hundreds of parameters per task need to be stored in an atom memory to guarantee non-forgetting. This proposed approach allows efficient inter-task and intra-task ensemble to further boost performance.

# 3.1 A SCALABLE APPROACH AGAINST FORGETTING

In CNNs, catastrophic forgetting occurs when a model learned from a sequence of past tasks is updated in favor of the current task, resulting in significant performance degradation. A straightforward solution, as mentioned before, is to archive  $\mathbf{W}^t$  in an external memory  $\mathcal{M} = \{\mathbf{W}^t\}_{t=1}^T$ , and the representation space of any previous model can be faithfully recalled by memory retrieval. However, as deep CNNs contain great amount of parameters in  $\mathbf{W}^t$ , this simple solution scales poorly with the number of tasks  $T$ . On the other hand, storing part of parameters, or small subsets of data for parameter flashback cannot avoid forgetting completely (Sarwar et al., 2019; Yoon et al., 2018).

This dilemma can be resolved with the proposed filter atom decomposition, as shown in Fig. 1. With the filter decomposition described in Sec. 2, by storing task-specific filter atoms  $\mathbf{D}^t$  into memory, and enforcing a task-shared coefficients  $\alpha$ , the model archives the entire knowledge for each time point. We refer to the memory for storing atoms as the atom memory,  $\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{D}} = \{\mathbf{D}^t\}_{t=1}^T$ ,  $\mathbf{D}^t \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k \times k}$  with each  $\mathbf{D}^t$  learned in the  $t$ -th task with empirical risk minimization,

$$
\underset {\mathbf {D} ^ {t}} {\arg \min } \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {t}} \mathcal {L} \left(\mathcal {F} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {i} ^ {t}; \boldsymbol {\alpha}, \mathbf {D} ^ {t}\right), \mathbf {y} _ {i} ^ {t}\right). \tag {2}
$$

The task-shared coefficients  $\alpha$  are learned on the first task jointly with the first group of atoms,

$$
\underset {\mathbf {D} ^ {1}, \boldsymbol {\alpha}} {\arg \min } \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N _ {1}} \mathcal {L} \left(\mathcal {F} \left(\mathbf {x} _ {i} ^ {1}; \boldsymbol {\alpha}, \mathbf {D} ^ {1}\right), \mathbf {y} _ {i} ^ {1}\right). \tag {3}
$$

In this way, we can guarantee that the statistical risk for a previous task  $t$  at any time point remains the same as we can recall faithfully the past model by multiplying the stored atoms with the task-shared coefficients,

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {\left(\mathcal {X} ^ {t}, \mathcal {Y} ^ {t}\right)} \left[ \mathcal {L} \left(\mathcal {F} ^ {t} \left(\mathcal {X} ^ {t}; \theta\right), \mathcal {Y} ^ {t}\right) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {\left(\mathcal {X} ^ {t}, \mathcal {Y} ^ {t}\right)} \left[ \mathcal {L} \left(\mathcal {F} \left(\mathcal {X} ^ {t}; \boldsymbol {\alpha} \times \mathbf {D} ^ {t}\right), \mathcal {Y} ^ {t}\right) \right]. \tag {4}
$$

Atom memory scalability. The proposed atom memory stores a group of atoms per task, which is scalable with increasing number of tasks. Formally, consider a  $l$ -layer CNN model with associated filters  $\mathbf{W} = \{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^l$ . As mentioned in Sec. 2, each filter can be decomposed as  $\mathbf{W}_i = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_i \times \mathbf{D}_i$ . The group of atoms for task  $t$  can then be denoted as  $\mathbf{D}^t = \{\mathbf{D}_i^t\}_{i=1}^l$ , which requires a size of  $lmk^2$  in storing parameters per task. This typically introduces only a few hundred of parameters for each task to be stored in the atom memory, which potentially supports continual learning on a large scale. Details for scalability comparison are shown in Sec. 5.2.1.

Analysis of excess risk bound. With task-shared coefficients  $\alpha$ , the model for each new task may seemingly expect some degree of underfitting. However, as demonstrated in Section 5, we still observe superior results over the state-of-the-art continual learning methods on all benchmarks we have evaluated. To understand this, we here theoretically analyze the excess risk bound for new tasks in the continual learning setting. For each tasks  $t \in \{1,2,\dots,T\}$ , model  $\mathcal{F}^t (\cdot ;\theta)$  consists of representation function  $\phi^t$  and prediction function  $\mathbf{w}^t (\mathbf{w}^t \in \mathbb{R}^k)$ . The representation function  $\phi^t$  maps an input  $\mathbf{x}$  to feature space  $Z \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$ . For the analysis purpose, we assume  $\phi^t$  is just one convolution layer, which can be decomposed as  $\phi^t = \alpha \times \mathbf{D}^t$ . Therefore, using the training samples from task  $t$ , we can solve the following optimization problem from Eq. (2):

$$
\min  \frac {1}{2 N ^ {t}} \| \mathbf {y} ^ {t} - (\boldsymbol {\alpha} \times \mathbf {D} ^ {t} (\mathbf {x} ^ {t})) _ {+} \mathbf {w} ^ {t} \| ^ {2} + \frac {\lambda}{2} \| \boldsymbol {\alpha} \times \mathbf {D} ^ {t} \| _ {F} ^ {2} + \frac {\lambda}{2} \| \mathbf {w} ^ {t} \| _ {F} ^ {2}, \tag {5}
$$

where we use the mean square error as our loss,  $(\cdot)_{+}$  is ReLU activation  $(z)_{+} = \max \{0,z\}$ . The shared coefficients  $\alpha$  are learned on the first task jointly with the first group of atoms. Similar to (Du et al., 2020), we also assume that there is a ground-truth optimal representation function  $\phi^{t,*}$  and prediction function  $\mathbf{w}^{t,*}$  for task  $t$ .

Assumption 1 (subgaussian input). There exists  $\rho >0$  such that, for all  $t\in \{1,2,\dots,T\}$ , the random vector  $\bar{x}\sim p^t$  is  $\rho^2$ -subgaussian. The  $p^t$  is the distribution of samples in task  $t$ .

Assumption 2 (oracle network). Assume for task  $t \in \{1, 2, \dots, T\}$  that  $\mathbf{y}^t = (\pmb{\alpha}^* \times \mathbf{D}^{t,*}(\mathbf{x}^t))_+ \mathbf{w}^{t,*} + z^t$  is generated by an oracle network with parameters  $\pmb{\alpha}^*$ ,  $\mathbf{D}^{t,*}$ , and  $\mathbf{w}^{t,*}$ . Noise term  $z^t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$ .

Excess risk bound. We can bound the excess risk of our learned model on the task  $t$ , i.e., how much our learned model  $(\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\mathbf{D}}^t, \hat{\mathbf{w}}^t)$  performs worse than the optimal model  $(\alpha^*, \mathbf{D}^{t,*}, \mathbf{w}^{t,*})$  on the task  $t$  as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E R (\hat {\boldsymbol {\alpha}}, \hat {\mathbf {D}} ^ {t}, \hat {\mathbf {w}} ^ {t}) = L _ {\mathcal {D} ^ {t}} (\hat {\boldsymbol {\alpha}}, \hat {\mathbf {D}} ^ {t}, \hat {\mathbf {w}} ^ {t}) - L _ {\mathcal {D} ^ {t}} (\boldsymbol {\alpha} ^ {*}, \mathbf {D} ^ {t, *}, \mathbf {w} ^ {t, *}) \\ \leq \sigma \bar {R} \cdot \tilde {O} (\frac {\sqrt {T r (\Sigma)} + \sqrt {\| \Sigma \| _ {2}}}{\sqrt {N ^ {t}}}) + \rho^ {4} \bar {R} ^ {2} \cdot \tilde {O} (\frac {T r (\Sigma) + \| \Sigma \| _ {2}}{N ^ {t}}) \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\bar{R} = \frac{1}{2}\| \pmb{\alpha}^{*}\times \mathbf{D}^{t,*}\|_{F}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}\| \mathbf{w}^{t,*}\|_{F}^{2},\Sigma = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim p}[\mathbf{x}\mathbf{x}^{\intercal}],N^{t}$  is the number of training samples.  $\tilde{O}$  is the big O notation, and  $L_{\mathcal{D}^t}$  is the expected loss with the data distribution  $\mathcal{D}^t$  . The detailed analysis is provided in the Appendix A.

# 3.2 INTER-TASK MODEL ENSEMBLE

The atom memory not only serves as an efficient way to archive past models with a guarantee against forgetting, but also enables efficient recall of past models for model ensemble to improve the performance in present task. As in Breiman (2001); Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017), ensemble performance increases with the independent level of ensemble members. Motivated by this, model ensemble over time for the current task at time  $r$  has a natural advantage that each ensemble member

Figure 3: Illustration of intra-task ensemble with  $E_{w} = 2$ .

$\mathcal{F}^t$  ( $t \in \{1, 2, \dots, r\}$ ) is learned from a different data distribution  $\mathcal{D}^t$ . However, most of other methods are not affordable to perform model ensemble across tasks since they often lack an effective and efficient way to recall past models. As illustrated in Fig. 2, with the atom memory, our method can faithfully and rapidly recall past models  $\mathcal{F}^t = \mathcal{F}(\cdot; \boldsymbol{\alpha} \times \mathbf{D}^t)$  by simply fetching atoms  $\mathbf{D}^t$  from the atom memory; and then perform inter-task model ensemble by constructing a uniformly-weighted mixture model and combine the predictions as (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017),

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {c - e n s} ^ {r} (\mathbf {x}) = \frac {1}{| \mathcal {S} ^ {r} | + 1} \sum_ {s \in \mathcal {S} ^ {r} \cup \{r \}} p _ {\mathcal {F}} (\mathbf {y} | \mathbf {x}, \theta^ {s}) = \frac {1}{E _ {c} + 1} \sum_ {s \in \mathcal {S} ^ {r} \cup \{r \}} \mathcal {F} (\mathbf {x}; \boldsymbol {\alpha} \times \mathbf {D} ^ {s}), \tag {6}
$$

where  $S^r$  denotes the index set of previous tasks used for ensemble, and  $E_c = |S^r|$ . For classification problem, it corresponds to averaging the predictive probabilities.

In continual learning, not all past models can bring positive effects on the current task. According to (Breiman, 2001; Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), only the ones that have enough strengths on the current  $r$ -th task can help enhance the performance as weak learners (Breiman, 2001), which can be selected based on task relevancy. Our assumption is that the more a past task  $t$  resembles the current  $r$ , the better performance will  $\mathcal{F}^t$  achieves on the present task. The problem then transforms to evaluating the model similarity effectively and efficiently. Note that to ensure the proposed ensemble method to be scalable across a very long historical task sequence  $T$ , highly efficient task relevancy assessment is indispensable here.

Assessing task relevancy by filter subspace distance. Task relevancy assessments proposed in (Achille et al., 2019; Zamir et al., 2018) work at the cost of heavy computation, which prevents their efficient applications in continual learning. While measuring the similarities among the learned models can be a straightforward proxy to the measurement of task relevancy, the widely studied methods, e.g., canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (Raghu et al., 2017; Morcos et al., 2018) and centered kernel alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019), still introduce considerable computational cost while performing evaluations in the representation space. Directly performing relevancy measurements by calculating the distance of filters works at highly desirable efficiency, yet can perform poorly without the costly semantic alignments over channels (Raghu et al., 2017). In our approach, thanks to the task-shared coefficients acting as structural regularizations, we show that model similarity measurements can now be efficiently evaluated through direct filter similarity measurements. And as we model filters using task-specific filter subspaces with coefficients shared, model similarity can be further reduced to assessing filter subspace distance via the Grassmann distance (Absil et al., 2004).

Formally, we characterize the filter subspace of the current model  $\mathcal{V}^r$  and a past model  $\mathcal{V}^t$  as:

$$
\mathcal {V} ^ {r} = \operatorname {S p a n} \left\{\mathcal {B} _ {1} ^ {r}, \dots , \mathcal {B} _ {M} ^ {r} \right\}, \quad \mathcal {V} ^ {t} = \operatorname {S p a n} \left\{\mathcal {B} _ {1} ^ {t}, \dots , \mathcal {B} _ {M} ^ {t} \right\}, \quad \mathcal {V} ^ {r}, \mathcal {V} ^ {t} \subset \mathbb {R} ^ {L}, \tag {7}
$$

where  $L = k^2$  is the dimension of kernel space,  $\mathcal{B} = \{\mathcal{B}_j\}_{j=1}^M$  are  $M (m > M)$  linear independent vectors serve as the bases of the filter subspace. We obtain  $\mathcal{B}$  by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) to atoms  $\mathbf{D} = U\Sigma V^T \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times m}$  and select the first  $M$  columns from  $U$  that correspond to the top- $M$  singular values. By definition,  $\mathcal{V}^r$  and  $\mathcal{V}^t$  are points of the Grassmann Manifold (Milnor & Stasheff, 2016), i.e.,  $\mathcal{V}^r, \mathcal{V}^t \in \operatorname{Grass}(M, L) \triangleq \{M$  dimensional subspaces of  $\mathbb{R}^L\}$ . Then, the Grassmann distance between  $\mathcal{V}^r$  and  $\mathcal{V}^t$  is defined as,

$$
d _ {M} \left(\mathcal {V} ^ {r}, \mathcal {V} ^ {t}\right) = \left(\sum_ {j} ^ {M} \theta_ {j} ^ {2}\right) ^ {1 / 2}, \tag {8}
$$

where  $\theta_{j}$  is the  $j$ -th principle angle, which can be calculated by,

$$
\theta_ {j} = \arccos  (\sigma_ {j}), \text {w i t h} \left(\boldsymbol {\mathcal {B}} ^ {r}\right) ^ {T} \boldsymbol {\mathcal {B}} ^ {t} = U \Sigma V ^ {T}, \sigma_ {j} = \Sigma_ {j j}. \tag {9}
$$

The proposed task relevancy measurement requires merely a SVD to matrices with dimensions lower than  $L$ . In practice,  $k = 3$  so that  $L = 9$ , indicating that computation of  $d_{M}$  is low. With the proposed efficient task relevancy measurement adopted in the last convolutional layer, we select the most  $E_{c}$  relevant models from previous  $r - 1$  ones that support the current task. We provide the correlation analysis of task similarities measured with CCA (Raghu et al., 2017) and the ones assessed by the proposed subspace distance in Appendix. C.5.

Although it is known that the ensemble result increases in the ensemble number  $E_{c}$  (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), it does not hold in our setting based on our empirical observation. In fact, determining the  $E_{c}$  is a trade-off between the amount and the relevancy of past knowledge. We thus empirically select the ensemble number  $E_{c}$ , which is illustrated in Sec. 5.2.1. The selected members are further fine-tuned with new classification heads to the current task.

# 3.3 INTRA-TASK MODEL ENSEMBLE

Our filter decomposition not only allows ensemble with past members, but also permits an efficient way to create ensemble members within a task. In the regular deep ensemble scenario (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), different members are instantiated as multiple CNNs, and need to be learned separately to ensure independence among members. Plus, obtaining ensemble results also requires inferences with multiple CNNs. This introduces significant cost in both time and memory, making it inappropriate in continual learning settings. The proposed atom decomposition allows a new way of parameterization of ensemble members within a task to improve performance while substantially reducing the training and testing time cost. Formally, given task  $t$ , the intra-task ensemble model  $\mathcal{F}_{w - ens}^{t}$  is composed by  $\{\hat{\mathcal{F}}^{t,1},\dots,\hat{\mathcal{F}}^{t,E_w}\}$ , where  $E_{w}$  is the number of models. Rather than instantiating them as different CNN models, we reparameterize them with member-specific atoms  $\{\hat{\mathbf{D}}^{t,1},\dots,\hat{\mathbf{D}}^{t,E_w}\}$ , and member-shared coefficient  $\alpha^t$ , as shown in Fig. 3. In this way, we create multiple virtual members using a single CNN model by simply maintaining different groups of filter atoms in each convolutional layer. The forward pass of  $\mathcal{F}_{w - ens}^{t}$  can then be conducted by group convolution,

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {w - e n s} ^ {t} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {t}\right) = \frac {1}{E _ {w}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {E _ {w}} \hat {\mathcal {F}} ^ {t, i} \left(\mathbf {x} ^ {t}\right) = \mathcal {F} _ {w - e n s} ^ {t} \left(\hat {\mathbf {x}} ^ {t}, \hat {W} _ {w - e n s} ^ {t}\right), \tag {10}
$$

where  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}^t\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times (c\times E_w)\times h\times w}$  is the input repeated by  $E_{w}$  times,  $\hat{W}_{w - ens}^{t} = [\pmb {\alpha}\times \hat{\mathbf{D}}^{t,1}\mid \dots \mid \pmb {\alpha}\times$ $\hat{\mathbf{D}}^{t,E_w}]\in \mathbb{R}^{c\times (c'\times E_w)\times k\times k}$  (| denotes concatenation) is the filter for group convolution that is concatenated from per-member reconstructed filters. To enforce the independence of different members, we initialize member-specific atoms separately before training.

With diverse predictions from different virtual members, our intra-task ensemble can directly boost the performance in task-incremental settings. Furthermore, our intra-task model ensemble makes the model to better distinguish data from out-of-task distribution, i.e.,  $\mathbf{x}^p (p\neq t)$ , and shows high entropy in its predictive distribution which is particularly useful in class incremental (CI) setting. Note that in CI we perform task prediction first, select a specific group of atoms, and then perform classification within task. Task id is selected based on minimal-entropy criterion on predictive distributions. Thus, intra-task ensemble can enhance the accuracy of task prediction, and then the overall CI performance.

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Datasets. We first validate our method on the Class-Incremental (CI) setting with 10-Split CIFAR100 dataset, where the 100 classes is broken down into 10 tasks with 10 classes per task. Note that in the CI setting, task information is not provided during testing. Then, we report the performance of our method under the Task-Incremental (TI) setting. We validate our approach on 5-Split MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), 20-Split CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), and 20-Split miniImageNet (Vinyals et al., 2016). The 5-Split MNIST uniformly splits the original 10 classes of 0-9 MNIST digits into 5 sequential tasks. 20-Split CIFAR100 and 20-Split miniImageNet are both constructed by randomly splitting 100 classes into 20 tasks with 5 classes per task. Details of each dataset are provided in the Appendix C.

Network architectures and implementation details. For the class-incremental setting, we utilize ResNet-32 as in (Rebuffi et al., 2017). For the task-incremental setting, we adopt an AlexNet-like network. Note that we substitute all convolutional layers in both models with our decomposed version. Details of architecture are shown in the Appendix C. In terms of the proposed ensemble strategies, inter-task ensemble is only deployed in the task-incremental setting as task IDs are needed, while intra-task ensemble is utilized in both task-incremental and class-incremental settings. In inter-task ensemble, we set  $M = 3$  for the dimension of filter subspaces. When intra-task ensemble and inter-task ensemble are adopted together, we use the member with the best results in every task for calculating task relevancy. We provide the ablation study for the inter-class and intra-class ensemble numbers  $E_{c}$  and  $E_{w}$  in Sec. 5.2.1. Training details are showed in the Appendix C.3.

Evaluation metrics. In the class-incremental setting, we evaluate the model classification accuracy on increasing classes after every task. In the task-incremental setting, we measure the performances with ACC as the average test accuracy across all tasks. To measure the forgetting, we adopt the backward transfer, BWT, which shows how the previous tasks performance has degraded due to learning new tasks. Details of these two measurements are provided in Appendix C.4.

# 5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we start from the challenging class-incremental setting. Then we move to task-incremental setting with self-comparison experiments to validate the effectiveness of some key ingredients of our methods, and show the results of the proposed method on several real-world datasets. In both settings, our method achieves improvements over state-of-the-art methods with significant less memory usage.

# 5.1 CLASS-INCREMENTAL COMPARISONS ON 10-Split CIFAR100

As a more challenging setting, class-incremental (CI) learning does not provide task id during training. As mentioned in Sec. 3.3, we handle this setting by breaking it down to a two-level task, task prediction based on minimal-entropy criterion, and then within-task classification. In CI experiments, we select the number of atoms  $m = 12$  and the number of members for intra-task ensemble  $E_{w} = 2$ . We benchmark our method by comparing with many existing methods that store 2000 exemplars in the external memory. Note that those compared methods are faithfully reproduced in Masana et al. (2020). As shown in Fig. 4, our method with intra-task ensemble achieves the best result with an order of magnitude less memory usage, which validates the effectiveness and scalability of our

# 5.2 RESULTS ON TASK-INCREMENTAL SETTINGS

# 5.2.1 SELF COMPARISONS ON 20-Split CIFAR100

In this section, we empirically analyze two key components, inter-task ensemble and intra-task ensemble of our method, and selection of atoms, in task-incremental setting. We analyze the performance of our base model with different number of atoms  $m$ , As shown in the left of Fig. 5,  $m = 12$  is the best choice in terms of both performance and efficiency. We then test the task relevancy assessment based on subspace distance, and its instructive effect to inter-task ensemble. As shown in Fig. 6, the past models with small Grassmann distance to the current model lead to performance improvement by model ensemble. And past models with large Grassmann distance to the current one, in fact result in degraded performances. In general, we test the ACC of model ensemble with the top-1 to top-3 relevant model as well as the most irrelevant model starting from the 5-th task. As shown in Fig. 6, model ensemble with top-3 relevant models achieves the best results, and thus we set  $E_{c} = 3$  in subsequent experiments. We then explore intra-task ensemble with different members  $E_{w} = 2, 3, 4$ . As illustrated in the middle of Fig. 5, ensemble within task enhances the performance consistently, and we choose  $E_{w} = 2$  for the best performance efficiency trade-off. We further illustrate the scalability of the proposed method on the right of Fig. 5. Compared to PNN (Rusu et al., 2016) and APD (Yoon et al., 2019), the size of our method scales much slower with the number of tasks, even with ensemble adopted.

# 5.2.2 COMPARISONS WITH BENCHMARKS

We further report our results on 20-Split miniImageNet and 20-Split CIFAR100 in Tab. 1. Comparing with regularization-based, memory-based, and expansion-based models, the proposed method achieves the best results even with the base model. Adopting inter-task ensemble with the top-3 relevant past models, along with intra-task ensemble with 2 members, our method achieves further improved results. Especially in 20-Split miniImageNet, the previous state-of-the-art method, ACL (Ebrahimi et al., 2020) achieves ACC of 62.07 with a memory in size of  $8.5\mathrm{MB}$ ; whereas the proposed method improves the results significantly to 67.84 with a merely 0.86 MB memory. When comparing with other memory-based methods besides ACL, the proposed method demonstrates superior scalability reflected by the much smaller memory size. We provide additional results on

the standard 5-Split MNIST dataset with our base model. As shown in Tab. D, our base method outperforms both regularization-based methods and memory-based methods in terms of ACC with much smaller memory. The improvements over the state-of-the-art methods and the outstanding scalability validate the effectiveness of our method on solving real-world continual learning problems.

# 6 RELATED WORK

Catastrophic forgetting is the central challenge of continual learning. Recent advances on continual learning is mainly driven by three main directions, which we will briefly review in terms of regularization-based, memory-based and expansion-based methods. For a more extensive overview we refer to the reviews by (De Lange et al., 2019; Parisi et al., 2019).

Regularization-based methods. (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017b; Aljundi et al., 2018a; Lee et al., 2017; Zenke et al., 2017b; Kolouri et al., 2019) determine the importance of each model's parameter per task, which prevents the important parameters from being updated for new tasks. For example, (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017b) specify the performance of each weight with the Fisher information matrix. (Aljundi et al., 2018a), on the other hand, proposes determining parameter importance by gradient magnitude. Theses methods can be naturally explored from the lens of Bayesian optimization (Nguyen et al., 2018; Titsias et al., 2020; Schwarz et al., 2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2019; Ritter et al., 2018). Specifically, (Nguyen et al., 2018) introduces a regularization technique, inspired by variational inference, to prevent their model from forgetting. All these methods address catastrophic forgetting by adding regularization terms. As pointed out in (De Lange et al., 2019), the penalty term proposed in such methods are unable to prevent drifts in the loss landscape of previous tasks. While alleviating forgetting, the penalty also unavoidably prevents the plasticity to absorb new information from future tasks learned over a long timescale (Hadsell et al., 2020).

Memory-based methods. (De Lange et al., 2019) assume it is feasible to access data from previous tasks by having a fixed-size memory or a generative model able to produce samples from previous tasks (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Riemer et al., 2018; Rios & Itti, 2018; Shin et al., 2017). (Rebuffi et al., 2017) introduces models augmented with fixed-size memory, which accumulates samples in the proximity of class centers. (Chaudhry et al., 2019b) proposes another memory-based model by exploiting a reservoir sampling strategy in the raw input data selection phase. Rather than storing the original samples, (Chaudhry et al., 2018a) accumulates the parameter gradients during task learning. (Shin et al., 2017) incorporate a generative model into a continual learning model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting by producing samples from previous task and retraining the model using data from previous tasks and the the current one. These methods assume an extra neural network, such as a generative model or a memory. Different from replay-based methods, which benefit from a memory to retrain their model over previous tasks, our method requires storage of tiny atoms for each previous task only, which is more scalable and do not suffer from potential forgetting caused by the inconsistent memory reply in generative-based methods.

Expansion-based methods. (Rusu et al., 2016; Yoon et al., 2018; Jerfel et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019) allocate a subset of the model parameters for each task. Model expansion can be achieved by a gating mechanism (Wortsman et al., 2020; Masse et al., 2018), or by incrementally adding new parameters to the models (Rusu et al., 2016). Incrementally learning and pruning provides another direction (Mallya & Lazebnik, 2018). Given an over-parametrized model with the ability to learn potentially many tasks, (Mallya & Lazebnik, 2018) achieves model expansion by pruning the parameters not contributing to the performance of the current task, while keeping them avail- able for future tasks. Comparing to the aforementioned methods, the proposed method provides a novel view of subspace of deep convolutional neural networks, which allows model expansion to be achieved with significantly decreased parameters, and is therefore scalable to even thousands of tasks.

# 7 CONCLUSION

In this paper, motivated by the task subspace modeling literature, we enforced a low-rank filter structure to each CNN layer across time in continual learning. By performing atom-coefficient filter decomposition, we learned for each task a new filter subspace for each layer, while keeping subspace coefficients shared across tasks. This simple method allows highly efficient model storage and retrieval using a small footprint atom memory. The proposed method provided a guarantee against forgetting, and we demonstrated further performance improvements through model ensemble. The performance was evaluated on various continual learning tasks, and the effectiveness and scalability were demonstrated by the state-of-the-art accuracy and the tiny size of model memory.
