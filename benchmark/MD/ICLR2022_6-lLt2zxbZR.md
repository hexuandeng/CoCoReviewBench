# NOT-SO FINE-TUNING: MEASURES OF COMMON SENSE FOR LANGUAGE MODELS

Anonymous authors

Paper under double-blind review

# ABSTRACT

Language models built using semi-supervised machine learning on large corpora of natural language have very quickly enveloped the fields of natural language generation and understanding. In this paper, we examine some critical assessments concerning the development and subsequent evaluation of language models and offer an alternative account. We provide evidence for the following conclusion: a language model with relatively few parameters, trained for relatively few steps, can perform robustly across language tasks in a manner that demonstrates compositionality, at the cost of GPU-time for language evaluation. The zero-shot measurement technique we advocate for is an application of pseudo-log likelihoods to masked language models for the relative measurement of probability for substitution alternatives in forced choice language tasks such as the Winograd Schema Challenge, Winogrande, CommonsenseQA, as well as on a minimal adversarial test set we create, dubbing it Winogradversarial. In some cases, our results are 'state-of-the-art' (SOTA) in an absolute sense, performing better than any published result in the literature. In others our results are SOTA relative to published methods similar to or identical to our own – in some cases by wide margins, but below SOTA absolute. We provide a narrative consistent with our measurement approach that has advantages over problematic prevailing approaches to evaluating and applying language models for common sense.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

# 1.1 THE RISE OF FINE-TUNING

Computational linguistics has made major strides in the adoption of machine learning techniques applied to unstructured corpora providing frequencies of words in natural human text (Collobert et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013a;b; Peters et al., 2018). N-gram models providing frequencies of pairs, triples, etc. of words in natural text provided further gains. However, a very influential paper in 2018, signalling a major shift in the application of machine learning to natural text, advocated for an architecture that has "a more structured memory for handling long-term dependencies in text, compared to alternatives like recurrent networks, resulting in robust transfer performance across diverse tasks:" the Transformer (Radford et al., 2018).

The authors of the first GPT paper emphasize the importance of long-term dependencies in natural language text for not only their choice of model, but also training data: "Crucially, [BooksCorpus], a common corpus for a multitude of emerging transformer models, contains long stretches of contiguous text, which allows the generative model to learn to condition on long-range information."

Why might 'long stretches of contiguous text', via learning conditioned on that text, lead to success at diverse tasks like natural language inference, question answering, sentence similarity, and classification (Radford et al., 2018, Table 1)? After all, these tasks typically involve very short, independent sections of text.

Solving the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) Levesque et al. (2012) seems to require vast amounts of common sense knowledge, and the job of learning long-term dependencies was supposed to help replacing actual knowledge of the world with the proxy knowledge that human-generated text

provides. Although language models do well at common sense benchmarks through fine-tuning, they do not generalize well to new samples that we offer. We are concerned that the fine-tuning method of teaching and evaluating language models on common sense tasks is not compositional.

# 1.2 SYSTEMATICITY AND COMPOSITIONALITY

An enduring interdisciplinary resource on compositionality is the 1988 “Connectionism and cognitive architecture: A critical analysis” (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). Human cognition is characterized by its systematicity. Suppose one is familiar with the concept of love, and is presented with the statement ‘Irati loves Zuri’<sup>1</sup>. Most English speakers ought to be able to conclude from this statement that it is possible that Zuri loves Irati, but not necessary. It is unlikely that these names are familiar to most people, who will still be able to draw these conclusions. Systematicity names this unbounded ability to do similar things with systematically related linguistic units.

Speakers of a natural language typically<sup>2</sup> possess the ability to understand and produce statements that they have never heard, in this unbounded fashion. Fodor and Pylyshyn argue that the representational feature of compositionality in first order logic explains systematicity; compositionality is the representational rule that syntactic rules and meaning of representational parts determine meanings of linguistic and mental representational wholes. Fodor and Pylyshyn consider the possibility that we might either think in a natural language like English, think in a different, neural language, or not think in a way that incorporates compositional representations at all.

Fodor and Pylyshyn reach the conclusion that 'connectionism' cannot be a theory of mental representations for speakers of natural languages. However, a key assumption is that whatever the representation of the concept of 'love' is in a fluent English speaker's mind, it must have structural features that mirror the systematic generalizations they make. This vision imagines mental representations as resembling expressions in first order logic. We take the long-standing response to this argument to be a rejection of premise that only classical logic can implement compositional representations. In the next section we demonstrate that this is not the case, despite the deficiencies of fine-tuned language models just described.

# 1.3 RECENT WORK ON COMPOSITIONALITY

A recent paper shows that for downstream, fine-tuned tasks for many natural language models, a pre-training corpus that only maintains word or n-gram frequencies performs very well relative to models pre-trained on long form text (Sinha et al., 2021). There are a number of possible conclusions one could draw. For example, one might conclude that fine-tuned performance leverages n-gram frequencies of a training corpus of human-generated text sufficiently well to learn common sense through the training step of fine-tuning on a list of, for example, Winograd-style schemas.

We are encouraged by different findings in the literature. Interest in the old problem of compositionality has been reinvigorated in the context of the advancing capacities of neural networks. Baroni (2020) and Russin et al. (2021) lay out existence proofs, providing clear evidence of the learnability of compositional syntactic and semantic domains. Ontañón et al. (2021) go further, and for a series of synthetic tasks that strongly benefit from compositionality, such as arithmetic, they perform ablation experiments across a number of features of modern Transformer architectures.

Ontañón et al. (2021) conclude that weight sharing (sometimes called 'parameter sharing', as in that adopted by the Transformer-based model of Albert (Lan et al. (2019)) is, alone, a design decision that "significantly boosts compositional generalization accuracy, and almost all models [with weight sharing] achieve a higher average accuracy across all datasets than their equivalent models [without weight sharing]...."(Ontañón et al., 2021, 6)  $^{3}$  We take this use of 'compositionality' to have taken over the meaning of 'systematicity', referring to behavioral consistency instead of representational form.

One important consequence of the design decision to incorporate parameter sharing into a transformer architecture is that it trades parameter size for computation time. In other words, parameter sharing yields representations that are space efficient relative to other models, but time inefficient. At least some researchers have recently argued, though, that time is a resource that ought to be traded for accuracy benefits (Banino et al., 2021).

# 1.4 SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS:

In this paper we investigate the properties of a language model with parameter sharing: albert-xxlarge-v2, small in both parameter count and pre-training corpus relative to the field of language models generally. We find that, when using PLL and NormPLL methods for scoring natural language with this model, it performs at a mixture of outright state-of-the-art at a series of recent binary common sense language tasks, notably hovering at around  $75 - 80\%$  under conditions both designed to be adversarial against language models, but also robust against accidental processes that reduce zero-shot performance in language models generally, such as semantically and syntactically noisy data.

To our knowledge, our results are SOTA for any approach to the Timedial (Qin et al., 2021) dataset; SOTA for any zero-shot approach to solving the train-xl split of Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2020); SOTA for an average score on the perturbed Winograd set (Abdou et al., 2020); and, SOTA for any zero-shot approach to WSC, with the exception of a reported result in which training and testing sets were mixed. In other cases, our approach is SOTA for zero-shot and competitive with fine-tuned approaches. We provide an explanation for the results and their significance in the context of a crisis in the confidence of fine-tuning.

# 2 CRITICISMS OF FINE-TUNING

# 2.1 THE 'IS' OF IDENTITY

The two most recent GPT papers, 'Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners' (Radford et al., 2019) and 'Language models are few-shot learners' (Brown et al., 2020) identify in their titles the nature or purpose of machine learning models for language with the purposes they put their GPT variants to in their paper. Those papers advocate for single-directional masked objectives instead of a bidirectional one, and fine-tuning for evaluation (although with more few- and zero-shot results reported in later papers). Since PLLs perform significantly better on bidirectional models (as Salazar et al. (2020), Zhou et al. (2020), and Ma et al. (2021) show) we disagree with both the model architecture and evaluation program they favour, thus disagreeing with their identification of language models with their preferred methods for pretraining and measuring them.

The fine-tuning regime has been challenged in the computational linguistics literature by a different objection, over the misuse of terms like 'understanding' and 'meaning' in describing the use of language models. Consider the following position:

We argue that the language modeling task, because it only uses form as training data, cannot in principle lead to learning of meaning. We take the term language model to refer to any system trained only on the task of string prediction, whether it operates over characters, words or sentences, and sequentially or not. (Bender & Koller, 2020)

The argument for this position is a familiar one, relying on thought experiments to show that some hypothesized system is not 'grounded' in the real world. Compare early criticisms of artificial intelligence by Hubert Dreyfus (Dreyfus, 1976), (Dreyfus et al., 1992). In our view, Bender & Koller (2020)'s criticisms of language models are too strong, and come dangerously close to identifying the representations formed through the use of masked and autoregressive language models with the objective functions – including, but not only string prediction tasks as we discuss in the final section.

Interest in understanding the performance of language models on common sense data sets is motivated precisely by the idea that we want the Turing test to be as sensitive as possible, as Bender & Koller (2020) advocate. If there are short binary comparison tests that require all of the human-in-the-world groundedness that you could want, as Daniel Dennett argues explicitly for in his dis

cussion of Winograd schemas, then the question of what language models are good for remains empirical (Dennett, 1984).

# 2.2 THE 'QUICK-PROBE ASSUMPTION'

In his discussion of Winograd schemas, Dennett defines what he calls the 'quick-probe assumption': success on a few Winograd schemas in a Turing test-style evaluation ought to indicate generalizability of a computer's ability to make common sense judgements, not merely success at the few examples like it, or examples like it in some superficial way only.

One of us, skeptical of fine-tuning for success at tasks like the Winograd Schema Challenge and similar problems, hand-made a set of 20 sentence pairs prior to collaboration on the present paper. The purpose of this set of Winograd-style pairs is to test whether fine-tuning can be attacked directly, as follows.

Suppose a training set contains multiple complete pairs, such that reference is shifted every time a sentence has a twin that is different only in some modifier or short phrase. Then perhaps a pair in which reference isn't shifted will be scored poorly, if the model is spuriously using the modifier trick. This can be an exploited trick (at least in principle) if, for example, one member of a Winograd schema pair is in the train set, and the other is in the test set<sup>5</sup>.

Here is an example from this small, hand-made data set:

1. This is why people are supposed to take salt tablets when  $< \text{mask}>$  sweat a lot. Answers: people, salt tablets  
2. This is why people are supposed to take salt tablets when  $< \text{mask}>$  sweat a little. Answers: people, salt tablets

By substituting the answers in for the mask above we get two pairs of sentences for a model to score, or assess the relative likelihood of, resulting in two questions of the suitcase/trophy example above. The correct answer above for both examples is 'people', since salt tablets don't sweat.

Table 1: Performance of various transformer models (large versions), Fine-tuning performed on Winogrande.  

<table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Fine-tuned</td><td>Zero-Shot</td></tr><tr><td>Bert</td><td>45%</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td>Roberta</td><td>50%</td><td>60%</td></tr><tr><td>Albert</td><td>55%</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>Deberta</td><td>50%</td><td>55%</td></tr></table>

In table 1 we compare the performance of a variety of models that have been fine-tuned on the Winogrande, a scaled WSC-variant debiased against RoBERTa (Sakaguchi et al., 2020). We find that the BERT family of language models generally does poorly on this data set when evaluating its fine-tuned discriminator on the data set. On the other hand, using a method of scoring sentences using language models in a manner which is free of hyperparameters, we also score the models – in the second column, there is no training beyond the objective functions of the models during semi-supervised pre-training.

Notice that a single model outperforms the others: albert-large. The albert-xxlarge-v2 variant scores an impressive  $80\%$  on the Winogradversarial dataset we present. It is a well-defined question to ask whether this high value for for that last variant is a statistical fluke, or evidence of a robust ability to score binary common sense sentence pairs at a rate of around  $80\%$ . This paper is an evidence-based argument for the latter.

# 2.3 PUBLICATION INCENTIVES AND ZERO-SHOT

A broad survey of machine learning research concludes that demonstrating an ability to innovate in model construction dominates work done in data set collection and cleaning (Sambasivan et al., 2021). In the next section we demonstrate this feature for the study of common sense reasoning. But, because we have access to academic computing resources, we are able to apply 'normalized pseudolog likelihood' (NormPLL) scoring at scale to recent, corporate-created common sense reasoning data sets.<sup>6</sup>

In Appendix D we compare the approach we share here to a wide range of common sense tasks, including COPA (Roemmele et al., 2011). The website associated with the COPA dataset contains an ethics injunction for its users with specific imperatives: researchers should not peek at the data set before they evaluating their model on it; and, researchers should only evaluate their method on COPA once. We can say that we succeeded mostly at the first, and entirely at the second.<sup>7</sup> Our zero-shot method scores an impressive  $80\%$  on COPA; as we argue below, sensitivity of the method to even extra spaces around punctuation marks necessitates a certain amount of familiarity with the data.

The incentives to publish impressive results in reputable venues on recent benchmarks for all NLP applications are well-known and do not need repeating. Regardless of one's priors for the ethical compliance of contemporary machine learning research generally, one may find zero-shot measurements of language models more reliable simply because of the fewer points of possible p-hacking, intentional or otherwise. We see this perspective increasingly in industry; a recent white paper eschews fine-tuning and even few-shot evaluation for assessing the representational quality of a natural language model. $^{8}$  The function of this short section is to promote zero-shot measurement as a methodology with fewer entry points for Clever Hans effects, intentional or otherwise.

# 3 METHODS AND RESULTS

# 3.1 SHIPS IN THE NIGHT

Here we describe three recent papers that all use some form of PLL or NormPLL, recently published, that do not cite one another – this speaks to a large community of focused and determined researchers in a wide variety of private and public settings. We employ the codebase of the first two approaches in preparation of our own results. For brevity we refer the reader to the papers mentioned below for an explanation of the algorithms.

# 3.1.1 MLM-SCORING

We first became aware of PLL scoring using language models via Salazar et al. (2020), and to our understanding their arxiv submission of that paper in late 2019 is the first treatment of the approach in the machine learning literature, although we acknowledge that the vast literature is growing ever more quickly. Much of our scoring is performed using the codebase associated with the paper. One key advantage of this codebase is that its use of mxnet means that scoring of individual sentences is efficiently shared among multiple GPUs if available. A minor disadvantage is that, in our experience on a managed academic computing platform, is that package compatibility was harder to achieve.

Salazar et al. (2020) style scoring is reported with GPU time for evaluation on an academic computing node with the following characteristics: 32 cores, RAM of 187G or 192000M, 2 x Intel Silver 4216 Cascade Lake @ 2.1GHz, 1 x 480G SSD, and 4 GPUs, all NVIDIA V100 Volta (32G HBM2 memory).

Notably the Salazar et al. (2020) paper treats many topics of interest in machine learning related to language, but does not examine PLL-style scoring on any common sense data sets.

# 3.1.2 CATS SCORING

Zhou et al. (2020) exclusively focuses on the application of NormPLL-style scoring to common sense data sets. What we call the NormPLL algorithm is the Salazar et al. (2020) pseudo-log likelihood scoring method, but dividing scores by the tokenized length of the expression. We had already completed a number of experiments when finding this codebase, and had already considered the concept of normalization over tokenized length. When comparing Winograd-style pairs, substitutions are usually of similar length – but they may not be.

An advantage of this codebase<sup>10</sup> is that it can be run in any environment that supports the huggingface and pytorch packages. A disadvantage of this approach is that there is no built-in parallelization across multiple GPUs if available; however, because the NormPLL algorithm involves summing over multiple forward passes of language models, it is well-suited to standard MapReduce-style parallelization.

# 3.1.3 ZERO-SHOT WITH HYPERPARAMETERS

Ma et al. (2021) present NormPLLs also under a scoring term (see their  $S_{MLM}(T)$  definition) and then augment their performance by providing language models with additional mask-filling training on instances of common sense judgements with tags. It is interesting to note that this results in the presentation of zero-shot results that are qualified with a '95% confidence interval'. Below we compare some of their results with NormPLLs using albert-xxlarge-v2, with a fuller picture available in Appendix D.

# 3.2 STATE OF THE ART WITHOUT FINE-TUNING

# 3.2.1 PURELY WINOGRADVERSARIAL DATASETS

We consider the performance of a variety of models on data sets that, with no more than light preprocessing, provide pairs of sentences that are labeled according to super-majority human judgement of common sense, with exactly one right answer per pair.

In Appendix C we reproduce a table from a forthcoming publication. In it we demonstrate, using NormPLLs with albert-xxlarge-v2, a  $6.5\%$  average improvement over the best zero-shot scoring presented in Abdou et al. (2020) over their 'perturbed' Winograd schemas.

The schemas are explicitly designed to reveal the brittleness of language model performance on common sense tasks. Notice that the  $Avg\Delta_{Acc}$  for albert-xxlarge-v1 is below the one measured for humans. In other words, zero-shot NormPLL scoring using albert variants show lower susceptibility to differing performance between the perturbed schemas than people (of course with lower absolute performance than people).

This surprising result prompted further investigation. The code made available with Zhou et al. (2020) makes it a trivial task (given GPU time) to extend their implementation (see their 'Score(S)' definition) of NormPLLs for the suite of tasks they provide. They test variations and sizes of GPT, BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. Table 2 reproduces the best scoring NormPLL and Human metrics from their table along with new results for albert-xxlarge-v2.

Table 3 contains results using PLLs on a variety of language models for the Winograd Schema Challenge data set (Levesque et al., 2012). In these data sets tokenized lengths tend to be similar across sentence pairs, and in these experiments we did not normalize scores when evaluating models.

Model features are reported from https://huggingface.co/models with model size in Pytorch.bin. 'kws' (short for 'keep weird spaces') indicates that the Timedial dataset is used as original presented at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research-datasets/TimeDial/main/test.json. 'not kws' indicates the application of a string function to input that removes spaces before punctuation symbols.

This data set is unusual in that every example contains the name of its author, researchers associated with the authors. It also contains results for the train-xl split of the Winogrande data set (Sakaguchi et al., 2020) containing over 44k crowdsourced Winograd schema-style examples.

The train-xl split contains 64,505 sentence comparisons. Each comparison involves scoring two sentences, and the model is scored correct if the higher scored sentence is labeled correct. This results in under 1 seconds of node time per row, or slightly under 0.5 seconds per sentence. This is slow by machine standards, but not slow by human standards. In each row we indicate the difference in score of a given model for the two data sets.

We are not aware of a higher zero-shot score on this Winogrande split. Notice that the value reported in Appendix D for the 'WG' column are reported for the much smaller development set from Winogrande. We are aware of a higher zero-shot score for the Winograd Schema Challenge data set in Brown et al. (2020)  $-88.3^{* - }$ , but that value is asterisked because the web crawled pre-training corpus for GPT-3 is so vast that it may contain much of the WSC dataset.

# 3.2.2 A RECENT (ALMOST) WINOGRADVERSARIAL DATASET: TIMEDIAL

The Timedial dataset (Qin et al., 2021) is similar to Winogradversarial because each row contains four substitutions into a given sentence, two of which are right and two of which are wrong. The term '2-best accuracy' is defined such that a given row is marked correct iff the scores for the two correct substitutions are both scored higher than the highest scored incorrect substitution.

Table 4 shows scores for a number of models on the Timedial data set that includes common sense judgements about the reasonability of judgements about time. Because they text data for these examples are so large, we artificially limit the pool to examples for which both scored passages are less than 450 tokens long once tokenized. This reduces the set by about  $5\%$ ; in future work, methods like the ones used by Ma et al. (2021) can be used to approximate full NormPLLs for sections of text larger than can be scored on a 32GB GPU; simple windowing is also a solution. Notice the significant increase in run-time for albert-xxlarge-v2 due to its parameter sharing; at run

time, parameters are 'unrolled' across a larger network than the size on disk would suggest. Using NormPLLs with albert-xxlarge-v2 produces a score on Timedial that is, so far as we know, is an absolute SOTA.

# 3.2.3 BRITTLENESS OF THE APPROACH

In Appendix D, Table 6, we provide a full picture of our results comparing zero-shot experiments on CSR benchmarks with large and extra large versions of Albert with the best performing model, to our knowledge, reported in the literature corresponding to a Roberta-Large model trained on additional synthetic datasets drawn from a combination of knowledge bases including ATOMIC, ConceptNet, WordNet, and Wikidata from Ma et al. (2021). We also report on a few other data sets such as COPA that can be rendered into two candidate sentence form.

Important findings that we highlight are that the while our experimentation demonstrates that without any additional data or knowledge source (which in itself would have invite an opportunity for multiple experimentation, even in the zero-shot regime, i.e., multitake) Albert pre-trained only on its original pre-training corpora achieves SOTA on a number of the CSR benchmarks (e.g., WSC, Winogrande, HellaSwag), it performs competitively (but sightly worse) on others, and is yet outperformed by a large margin on a few others, the most noticeable of which is on SIQA  $(-14.89\%)$ .

This suggests that as far as apples-to-oranges comparisons with transformer models that are either enhanced with external information and/or selected from a pool of variants that depend on a combination of those enhancements, architectural innovations such as weight-sharing of which Albert is an example, allows for competitive but not universally superior results. Another observation is that wherever Albert does perform better or at least competitively, the number of options for the labels is lower (e.g., as in binary tasks of WSC and Winogrande).

# 3.3 A TALE OF THREE WINOGRADS

Here we draw attention to three quantities that should, abstractly, be identical, but are instead different. The Winograd Schema Challenge is a public dataset that is currently available in xml format on the open web.[11] Visiting this site in a modern browser such as Google Chrome results in a nicely formatted series of questions, reproduced in Appendix E. On the other hand, by 'viewing the source' of the rendered xml, a different representation can be seen making certain features more obvious of the dataset, also reproduced there.

The second representation makes more clear that there is extra white space in the strings for some fields but not others; in some cases there is extra white space at the front, but not back of a string. Also, there are initial capitalizations in the two answer fields that won't be appropriate when substituted for the pronoun so as to complete scoreable sentences.

Now consider the question: how does the albert-xxlarge-v2 perform on the dataset presented in these figures? Consider table 2: 0.798. In table 5 in the Appendix it is reported as 0.796. Finally, according to table 3, it is 0.810. The roberta-large scores are, respectively, 0.694, 0.708, and 0.768. Here is the source of the discrepancy. The highest scores in both cases, table 3, correspond to PLL scoring on Winograd schema challenge data that we have provided a single python script<sup>12</sup> for downloading from its public location on the Web, and then provides some explicit cleaning and concatenating to produce two individual sentences. The other two scores are produced using pipelines from Zhou et al. (2020) for table 2 and Abdou et al. (2020) for table 5.

Those pipelines included preprocessing of the xml into other formats that can be inspected via the repositories for those papers. It is to the credit of the authors of both papers that their pipeline has been made public, including the parts. Thanks to this transparency, we can report problems with both datasets.

The Zhou et al. (2020) Winograd Schema Challenge data for table 2 contains what we call here 'weird spaces'. These are expressions such as care of john . John . In addition, it contains numerous odd concatenations, such as Xenophanesconveys. Finally, it lower cases some proper names, likely in trying to deal with leading Thes in answer fields, but not others. The Abdou et al. (2020) data for table 5 is entirely lower cased. The codebase does not provide the final sentence as it is used for model scoring, but inspecting the jsonl reveals many extra spaces before punctuation marks.

# 4 DISCUSSION

We have provided evidence that albert-xxlarge-v2's NormPLL performance on the Winogradversarial data set displays the benefits of parameter sharing through compositional abilities to solve common sense language tasks. In addition to a bidirectional masked language objective, like all BERT descendants, it also has a sentence order prediction task. This binary categorical objective function is more difficult than the original BERT sentence order prediction task which, as has been widely noted, reduces to topic modeling, for which bag-of-word representations are good approximations. Albert's sentence order prediction task corresponds to the problem of determining, for a pair of consecutive sentences, which one comes first in the source text and which one comes second. Consider the following pair of sentences, selected by finding consecutive sentences after clicking the 'random article' button at wikipedia:

Sentence 1: "Audrey Henshall was born in Oldham, Lancashire in 1927[2] and studied at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MA in 1949."

Sentence 2: "From 1960 to 1971 she was the Assistant Keeper of Archaeology at the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland."

One method to identify that Sentence 2 comes after Sentence 1 and not vice-versa is simply the presence of date information. The English language groups together many different causal relations and human experiences into physical metaphors, as has long been noted in the cognitive science literature (Thelen, 1995). The evidence suggests that Albert is an architecture that both excels at the formation of compositional representations, but was also trained with an objective function that encourages learning of asymmetric relations, such as 'before'; furthermore, those relations are implicated across multiple domains of human activity.

The remarkable consistency of Albert's performance on Winogradversarial, Timedial, WSC, and Winogrande datasets is a point of optimism for the research community. Notice Albert's consistency even under syntactic ('weird spaces') and semantic perturbations, calling into question the classical syntax/semantics divide. Salazar et al. (2020) tout the success of PLLs on grammaticality, and here we are discussing state-of-the-art on common sense judgements of the acceptability of time statements. A limitation of the current approach is that the robust performance seems to be limited to cases in which a common sense judgement can be expressed as the relative likelihood of two natural language alternatives, a promising avenue for future work.

We emphasize the improvement in both computational efficiency and accuracy that is effected for the Timedial dataset by cleaning punctuation so as to more closely match normal human conventions. This evidence supports the view that attention and care to data is as important as model innovations in machine learning generally, despite academic and industry practice not always matching this ideal (Sambasivan et al., 2021).

The difference between Grad and Grande (table 3) across language models measured through PLLs provides evidence for the hypothesis that crowdsourcing common sense data sets produces a measurable decline in data quality; perhaps training a language model on that data is not a good idea. Patience, objective functions, care with data and evaluation methods may matter much more for building language models that understand common sense than parameter and/or training corpus size. There remains ample grounds for future work towards innovation at the (relative) bottom of those metrics.
