# ABSTRACT

Implicit graph neural networks (IGNNs) that solve a fixed-point equilibrium equation for representation learning can learn the long-range dependencies (LRD) in the underlying graphs and show remarkable performance for various graph learning tasks. However, the expressivity of IGNNs is limited by the constraints for their well-posedness guarantee. Moreover, when IGNNs become effective for learning LRD, their eigenvalues converge to the value that slows down the convergence, and their performance is unstable across different tasks. In this paper, we provide a new well-posedness condition of IGNNs leveraging monotone operator theory. The new well-posedness characterization informs us to design effective parameterizations to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of IGNNs. Leveraging accelerated operator splitting schemes and graph diffusion convolution, we design efficient and flexible implementations of monotone operator IGNNs that are significantly faster and more accurate than existing IGNNs.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Implicit graph neural networks (IGNNs) that solve a fixed-point equilibrium equation for graph representation learning can learn long-range dependencies (LRD) in the underlying graphs, showing remarkable performance for various tasks [57; 31; 48; 52; 17]. Let  $G = (V,E)$  represent a graph, where  $V$  is the set of  $n = |V|$  nodes and  $E \subset V \times V$  is the set of edges. The connectivity of  $G$  can be represented by the adjacency matrix  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  with the  $(i,j)$ -th entry  $A_{ij} = 1$  if there is an edge connects nodes  $i,j \in V$ ; otherwise  $A_{ij} = 0$ . Let  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  be the initial node features whose  $i$ -th column  $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$  is the initial feature of the  $i$ -th node. A particular IGNN model [31] learns the node representation by finding the fixed point, denoted as  $Z^*$ , of the Picard iteration below

$$
\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {(k + 1)} = \sigma \left(\boldsymbol {W} \boldsymbol {Z} ^ {(k)} \boldsymbol {G} + g _ {\boldsymbol {B}} (\boldsymbol {X})\right), \text {f o r} k = 0, 1, 2, \dots , \tag {1}
$$

where  $\sigma$  is the nonlinearity (e.g. ReLU),  $g_{B}$  is a function parameterized by  $\pmb{B}$  (e.g.  $g_{B}(\pmb {X}) =$ $\pmb {BXG}),\pmb {W},\pmb {B}\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$  are learnable weights, and  $\pmb{G}$  is a graph-related matrix. In IGNN,  $\pmb{G}$  is chosen as  $\hat{\pmb{A}}\coloneqq \hat{\pmb{D}}^{-1 / 2}(\pmb {I} + \pmb {A})\hat{\pmb{D}}^{-1 / 2}$  with  $\pmb{I}$  being the identity matrix and  $\hat{D}$  is the degree matrix with  $\hat{D}_{ii} = 1 + \sum_{j = 1}^{n}A_{ij}$  .IGNN constrains  $\pmb{W}$  on-the-fly using a tractable projected gradient descent method to ensure the well-posedness of Picard iterations at the cost of limiting the expressivity of IGNNs. The prediction of IGNN is given by  $f_{\Theta}(Z^{*})$  , where  $f_{\Theta}$  is a function parameterized by  $\Theta$  . See Appendix A for more details of IGNN. IGNNs have several advantages over many existing GNNs: 1) The depth of IGNN is adaptive to

particular data and task rather than fixed. 2) Training IGNNs requires constant memory independent of their depth — leveraging implicit differentiation [55; 1; 43; 12]. 3) IGNNs have better potential to capture LRD of the underlying graph compared to existing GNNs include GCN [63], GAT [61], SSE [18], and SGC [67]. The latter GNNs lack the capability to learn LRD as they suffer from oversmoothing [47; 72; 51; 16]. Several methods have been proposed to alleviate over-smoothing and

hence improve learning LRD by geometric aggregation [54], by adding a fully-adjacent layer [2], and by improving breadth-wise backpropagation [49].

When can IGNNs learn LRD? To understand when IGNN can learn LRD, we run IGNN using the settings in [31] to classify directed chains, which is a synthetic dataset designed to test the effectiveness of GNNs in learning LRD [59; 31]. Fig. 1 plots epoch vs. accuracy of IGNN for the chain classification. Here, each epoch means iterating Equation (1) until convergence and then updating  $W$  and  $B$  at the end. For the binary case, IGNN can classify chains perfectly at length 100 but performs near random guesses when the length is 250. For the three-class chains, IGNN's performance is very poor for chains of length 100 but performs quite well at length 80. We investigate the results above by studying the dynamics of eigenvalues of the matrix  $|W|^{1}$ . For illustrative purpose, we consider  $\lambda_{1}(|W|)$  and  $\lambda_{2}(|W|)$ , the largest and the second largest eigenvalue of  $|W|$  in magnitude. Fig. 2 (left) contrasts the evolution of the magnitude of  $\lambda_{1}(|W|)$  and  $\lambda_{2}(|W|)$  of IGNN for classifying chains of different classes with different lengths. We see that the magnitude of both eigenvalues goes to 1 when IGNN becomes accurate for classifying the chains. However, Fig. 2 (right) shows that IGNN takes many more iterations in each epoch when the magnitude of the eigenvalues gets close to 1. Indeed, when  $\lambda_{1}(|W|) \to 1$ , the Lipschitz constant of the linear map  $WZG + g_{B}(X)$  is close to 1, slowing down the convergence of the Picard iterations; see Appendix E.1 for details. The results in Fig. 2 echo our intuition, the representation of a given node aggregates one more hop neighbors' information after each Picard iteration; when the leading eigenvalues get close to 1, Equation (1) converges slowly such that IGNN can capture LRD before the fixed point iteration converges. We report the results for classifying chains of different lengths in Appendix G; these results show prevalently that there are two bottlenecks of existing IGNNs [31]: 1) They suffer from an inherent tradeoff between computational efficiency and expressivity for learning LRD. 2) The performance of IGNNs, based on Picard iteration, is unstable in the sense that their performance varies substantially across tasks. In particular, in the event the leading eigenvalues  $|W|$  do not get close to 1, the resulting IGNN model cannot learn LRD. To resolve the two issues above, we propose renovating Equation (1) such that 1) the magnitude of the eigenvalues of  $W$  tend toward 1, and 2) we can find the fixed point of the modified model in a computationally efficient manner.

# 1.1 OUR CONTRIBUTION

We develop accurate, stable, and efficient monotone operator IGNNs (MIGNNs) $^2$ . In particular, we derive a new well-posedness condition for MIGNN leveraging monotone operator theory; see Sec 2. The new well-posedness condition of MIGNN informs us to design 1) a Cayley transform-based orthogonal parameterization of  $W$  whose eigenvalues all have the same magnitude to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of MIGNNNs, and 2) a monotone parameterization of  $W$ , whose eigenvalues can take a much wider range than that of the existing IGNNs, to boost the expressivity of MIGNNNs; see Sec. 3. We implement MIGNNNs leveraging Anderson accelerated operator splitting schemes accompanied

# 1.2 ADDITIONAL RELATED WORK

We briefly review some representative related works in three directions: deep equilibrium models (DEQs), GNNs, and orthogonal parameterizations for recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

DEQ. IGNN is closely related to DEQs [6; 22; 7], but the equilibrium equation of IGNN differs from DEQs in that IGNN encodes graph structure. DEQs are a class of infinite depth weight-tied feedforward neural networks with forward propagation using root-finding and backpropagation using implicit differentiation. As a result, training DEQs only requires constant memory independent of

the network's depth. Monotone operator theory has been used to guarantee the convergence of DEQs [65] and to improve the robustness of implicit neural networks [36]. The convergence of DEQs has also been considered from the viewpoint of constraining the network's weights [41]. The optimization dynamics of the linearized DEQs are studied in [38]. Fast algorithms have been proposed to improve learning DEQs. The authors of [8] propose Jacobian regularization to stabilize the training of DEQs. The authors of [9] propose Anderson accelerated DEQs with learned acceleration-related hyperparameters.

Graph neural networks. Classical GNNs are defined by stacking explicitly defined graph filtering layers. Examples include graph convolutional networks (GCNs) [13; 19; 40], GraphSAGE [32], neural graph fingerprints [20], graph isomorphism network (GIN) [68], message passing neural networks [29], and graph attention networks (GATs) [61]. These explicitly defined GNNs have been the backbone for deep learning on graphs. Designing GNNs that are defined implicitly is an emerging research area. There are some recent advances on IGNNs: EIGNN removes the nonlinearity in each intermediate iteration and derived a closed form of the infinite iterations [48], convergent graph solver (CGS) is an IGNN model with convergence guarantees by constructing the input-dependent linear contracting iterative maps [52], GIND leverages implicit nonlinear diffusion to access infinite hops of neighbors while adaptively aggregating features with nonlinear diffusion to prevent over-smoothing [17]. In addition to Picard iteration, implicit GNNs have also been defined by parametrizing the diffusion equation on graphs, see e.g. [14; 60; 15].

Orthogonal parameterization for deep learning. The fixed point iteration Equation (1) is related to the hidden state updates of RNNs [55; 23; 1; 42]. Learning LRD is challenging for RNNs due to exploding and vanishing gradient during backpropagation through time [64; 11; 53]. Enforcing orthogonal parameterization for RNNs is an effective approach to overcome exploding and vanishing gradients, benefiting RNNs for learning LRD [4; 66; 37; 62; 50; 33].

# 1.3 NOTATION

We denote scalars by lower- or upper-case letters and vectors/matrices by lower-/upper-case boldface letters. For a vector  $\mathbf{a}$ , we use  $\| \mathbf{a} \| / \| \mathbf{a} \|_{\infty}$  to denote its  $\ell_2 - \ell_{\infty}$ -norm. We use  $\mathbf{I}$  to denote the identity matrix whose dimension can be inferred from the context. For a matrix  $\mathbf{A}$ , we denote its transpose as  $\mathbf{A}^{\top}$ , its inverse as  $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ , its Frobenius norm/2-norm/∞-norm as  $\| \mathbf{A} \|_F / \| \mathbf{A} \| / \| \mathbf{A} \|_{\infty}$ , and we denote its  $i$ -th largest eigenvalue in magnitude as  $\lambda_i(\mathbf{W})$ . Given two matrices  $\mathbf{A}$  and  $\mathbf{B}$ , we denote their Kronecker/entry-wise product as  $\mathbf{A} \otimes \mathbf{B} / \mathbf{A} \odot \mathbf{B}$ , and denote  $\mathbf{A} \succ \mathbf{B} (\mathbf{A} \succeq \mathbf{B})$  if  $\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}$  is positive definite (semi-positive definite). We use  $\operatorname{vec}(\mathbf{A})$  to denote the vectorization of the matrix  $\mathbf{A}$  in a column-major order. The meaning of other notations can be inferred from the context.

# 2 WELL-POSEDNESS OF MIGNN: A MONOTONE OPERATOR PERSPECTIVE

In this section, we characterize the well-posedness of MIGNN leveraging monotone operator theory, see Appendix B for a brief review of monotone operator theory. Using the Kronecker product and vectorization of a matrix, we can rewrite Equation (1) into the following equivalent form

$$
\operatorname {v e c} \left(\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {(k + 1)}\right) = \sigma \left(\boldsymbol {G} ^ {\top} \otimes \boldsymbol {W} \operatorname {v e c} \left(\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {(k)}\right) + \operatorname {v e c} \left(g _ {\boldsymbol {B}} (\boldsymbol {X})\right)\right). \tag {2}
$$

Gu et al. propose the well-posedness condition of IGNN as  $\lambda_1(|\pmb{G}^\top \otimes \pmb{W}|) < 1$ , guaranteeing that the unique fixed point of Equation (2) can be found by Picard iteration. Notice that when  $\pmb{G} = \hat{\pmb{A}}$  all eigenvalues of the matrix  $\hat{\pmb{A}}$  are in  $[-1,1]$  with  $\lambda_1(\pmb{G}) = 1$ . Therefore, we have  $\lambda_1(|\pmb{G}^\top \otimes \pmb{W}|) = \lambda_1(\pmb{G})\lambda_1(|\pmb{W}|) = \lambda_1(|\pmb{W}|) < 1$  according to Perron-Frobenius Theorem. Moreover, all eigenvalues of  $|\pmb{W}|$  have magnitude less than 1.

We seek to apply the monotone operator theory to improve the expressivity and efficiency of existing IGNNs. According to the monotone operator theory [56], finding the fixed point of Equation (2) is equivalent to solving the monotone inclusion problem: find  $\mathbf{0} \in (\mathcal{F} + \mathcal{G})(\mathrm{vec}(Z))$ , where

$$
\mathcal {F} (\operatorname {v e c} (Z)) = \left(\boldsymbol {I} - \boldsymbol {G} ^ {\top} \otimes \boldsymbol {W}\right) \operatorname {v e c} (\boldsymbol {Z}) - \operatorname {v e c} \left(g _ {\boldsymbol {B}} (\boldsymbol {X})\right) \text {a n d} \mathcal {G} = \partial f, \tag {3}
$$

where  $f$  is a convex closed proper (CCP) function such that  $\sigma = \mathrm{prox}_f^1$ , where

$$
\operatorname {p r o x} _ {f} ^ {\alpha} (x) \equiv \underset {z} {\operatorname {a r g m i n}} \Bigl \{\frac {1}{2} \| x - z \| ^ {2} + \alpha f (z) \Bigr \}, \mathrm {f o r} \forall \alpha > 0.
$$

Notice that when  $\sigma$  is ReLU, then  $\sigma = \mathrm{prox}_f^\alpha$  for  $\forall \alpha > 0$  with  $f$  being the indicator of the positive octant, i.e.  $f(x) = I\{x \geq 0\}$ . The above monotone inclusion problem admits a unique solution if the operator  $\mathcal{F}$  is strongly monotone, i.e.  $\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{G}^{\top} \otimes \boldsymbol{W} \succeq m\boldsymbol{I}$  for some  $m > 0$ , or equivalently,

$$
\frac {1}{2} \left(\boldsymbol {G} ^ {\top} \otimes \boldsymbol {W} + \boldsymbol {G} \otimes \boldsymbol {W} ^ {\top}\right) \preceq (1 - m) \boldsymbol {I}.
$$

Therefore, we obtain the following well-posedness condition for MIGNN:

Proposition 1 (Well-posedness condition for MIGNN). Let the non-linearity  $\sigma$  be  $ReLU$  and  $\pmb{K} = \frac{1}{2} (\pmb{G}^{\top}\otimes \pmb {W} + \pmb {G}\otimes \pmb{W}^{\top})$ . Then the MIGNN model Equation (2) is well-posed as long as  $\pmb{K}\preceq (1 - m)\pmb{I}$  for some  $m > 0$ . As  $\pmb{K}$  is symmetric,  $\pmb{K}\preceq (1 - m)\pmb{I}$  is equivalent to  $\lambda_1(K)\leq 1 - m$ .

We provide the proof of Proposition 1 in the appendix; similarly, the proofs of all the subsequent theoretical results are provided in the appendix. The well-posedness condition in Proposition 1 is more flexible than that provided in [31] since it allows the eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{W}$  to be less than  $-1$ .

# 3 FLEXIBLE PARAMETERIZATION OF MIGNN

In this section, we present the orthogonal and monotone parameterizations of  $W$  for MIGNN in Equation (2). The orthogonal parameterization can stabilize and accelerate the training of MIGNNs and the monotone parameterization can enhance IGNN's expressivity.

# 3.1 ORTHOGONAL PARAMETERIZATION

As discussed in Sec. 1, MIGNNs can effectively learn LRD when  $\lambda_{1}(|\pmb{W}|)$  approaches 1, which is often not the case for IGNN. Inspired by the unitary RNN [4], we propose to use the orthogonal parameterization [33; 46; 45] with a learnable scaling factor to stabilize the training of MIGNN. In particular, we parameterize  $\pmb{W}$  by the following Cayley map scaled by a positive scalar

$$
\boldsymbol {W} = \phi (\gamma) (\boldsymbol {I} - \boldsymbol {S}) (\boldsymbol {I} + \boldsymbol {S}) ^ {- 1}, \tag {4}
$$

where  $\phi(\cdot)$  is the sigmoid function and  $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$  is a learnable parameter ensuring  $\phi(\gamma) \in (0,1)$ .  $S$  is a skew-symmetric matrix, which is chosen as  $C - C^{\top}$  with  $C \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  an arbitrary matrix. It is evident that MIGNN with the parameterization in Equation (4) is well-posed with  $G$  being  $\hat{A}$  defined in Sec. 1. Also, all eigenvalues of  $(I - S)(I + S)^{-1}$  have magnitude 1, see a derivation in Appendix E.3. To effectively learn LRD, MIGNN only requires the scalar  $\phi(\gamma)$  to converge to 1. Moreover, the orthogonal parameterization of MIGNN allows simple yet effective approximations of the matrix inversion within the operator splitting framework; see Sec. 4.1 for details.

# 3.2 MONOTONE PARAMETERIZATION

In the original IGNN model Equation (1), all eigenvalues of  $W$  and  $G$  have magnitude at most 1. The monotone operator theory-based relaxed well-posed condition in Proposition 1 informs us to design more flexible parameterization of  $W$  in two steps: 1) Redesigning the node feature aggregation matrix  $G$  in Equation (1) to ensure it is positive semi-definite. 2) Designing a suitable parameterization of  $W$  to guarantee that  $W$  can represent all matrices whose eigenvalues are less than 1. We formulate the results for the above two steps in the following proposition.

Proposition 2 (Monotone parameterization). Let  $G = (V, E)$  be a graph and let  $\pmb{G}$  be  $L/2$  with  $\pmb{L} := D^{-1/2}(\pmb{D} - \pmb{A})D^{-1/2}$  being the (symmetric) normalized Laplacian, where  $\pmb{A}$  is the adjacency matrix and  $\pmb{D}$  is the degree matrix with  $D_{ii} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij}$ . Then the following MIGNN model

$$
\boldsymbol {Z} = \sigma (\boldsymbol {W Z G} + g _ {B} (\boldsymbol {X})) \tag {5}
$$

is well-posed when the weight matrix  $\mathbf{W}$  is parameterized as follows

$$
\boldsymbol {W} = (1 - m) \boldsymbol {I} - \boldsymbol {C} \boldsymbol {C} ^ {\top} + \boldsymbol {F} - \boldsymbol {F} ^ {\top},
$$

where  $\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{F} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  are arbitrary matrices, and  $m > 0 \in \mathbb{R}$ .

# 4 ACCELERATED OPERATOR SPLITTING FOR IMPLEMENTING IGNNS

Operator splitting schemes often converge faster than Picard iteration and can guarantee convergence of IGNNs even when Picard iteration fails [56]. In this section, we present efficient implementations

of MIGNNs with orthogonal or monotone parameterization using Anderson accelerated operator splitting schemes [24], including forward-backward (FB), and Peaceman-Rachford (PR) splitting schemes. See C.2 for a review of operator splitting schemes.

# 4.1 FORWARD PROPAGATION FOR FINDING THE FIXED POINT

# 4.1.1 FB SPLITTING

We can find the fixed point of MIGNN in Equation (2), via FB splitting, by the iteration below

$$
\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {k + 1} := F _ {\alpha} ^ {\mathrm {F B}} \left(\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {k}\right) := \operatorname {p r o x} _ {f} ^ {\alpha} \left(\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {k} - \alpha \cdot \left(\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {k} - \boldsymbol {W} \boldsymbol {Z} ^ {k} \boldsymbol {G} - g _ {B} (\boldsymbol {X})\right)\right), \tag {6}
$$

where  $\alpha > 0$  is an appropriate constant. We provide a detailed implementation of FB splitting in Equation (6) in Appendix F.1. Note that the Lipschitz constant of the FB iteration is  $L^{\mathrm{FB}} := \sqrt{1 - 2\alpha m + \alpha^2}\|\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{G}^\top \otimes \mathbf{W}\|^2$  [56, Section 5]. Therefore, FB splitting converges to the fixed point given  $\alpha < 2m/\|\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{G}^\top \otimes \mathbf{W}\|^2$ . By choosing a proper  $\alpha$ , FB splitting can converge in the regime that Picard iterations does not. However,  $\|\mathbf{W}\|$  can be arbitrarily large when the monotone parameterization is used, and thus  $\alpha$  needs to be small to guarantee the convergence of FB splitting, in which case the Lipschitz constant is close to 1 and the convergence of FB splitting will be significantly slowed.  $\|\mathbf{W}\|$  can be arbitrarily large when monotone parametrization is used, and  $\alpha$  needs to be relatively small to guarantee the convergence of FB splitting. In this case, the Lipschitz constant is close to 1 and the convergence of FB splitting will be significantly slowed.

# 4.1.2 PR SPLITTING

To overcome the bottlenecks of FB splitting mentioned above, we employ the PR splitting adapted from [65] to obtain guaranteed convergence for any  $\alpha$  and generally within fewer iterations than FB splitting. PR splitting finds the solution  $Z^{*}$  of the MIGNN by letting  $Z^{*} = \mathrm{prox}_{f}^{\alpha}(U^{*})$  where  $U^{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  is obtained from the fixed-point iteration  $F_{\alpha}^{\mathrm{PR}}(\mathrm{vec}(U^{k})) = \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{F}} \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{G}}(\mathrm{vec}(U^{k}))$ , and  $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{F}}$  and  $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{G}}$  are the Cayley operators (see Appendix B for details) of  $\mathcal{F}$  and  $\mathcal{G}$ , respectively. Let  $\boldsymbol{u}^{k}$  be the shorthand notation of  $\mathrm{vec}(U^{k})$ . Then we can formulate the PR splitting as follows

$$
\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k + 1} := F _ {\alpha} ^ {\mathrm {P R}} \left(\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}\right) = 2 \boldsymbol {V} \left(2 \operatorname {p r o x} _ {f} ^ {\alpha} \left(\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}\right) - \boldsymbol {u} ^ {k} + \alpha \operatorname {v e c} \left(g _ {\boldsymbol {B}} (\boldsymbol {X})\right)\right) - 2 \operatorname {p r o x} _ {f} ^ {\alpha} \left(\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}\right) + \boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}, \tag {7}
$$

where the matrix  $\mathbf{V} \coloneqq (\mathbf{I} + \alpha (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{G}^{\top} \otimes \mathbf{W}))^{-1}$  and  $\mathbf{u}^{0}$  is the zero vector. With the parametrizations discussed in Section 3, the linear operator  $\mathcal{F}$  in Equation (3) is strongly monotone and  $L$ -Lipschitz where  $L = \| \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{G}^{\top} \otimes \mathbf{W} \|$ . Therefore, its Cayley operator  $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{F}}$  and hence  $F_{\alpha}^{\mathrm{PR}}$  is contractive with the optimal choice of  $\alpha$  being  $1 / L$ , see [56, Section 6]. In particular, it is suggested to choose  $\alpha = 1 / (1 + \phi(\gamma))$  when using orthogonal parametrization  $\mathbf{W} = \phi(\gamma)(\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{S})(1 + \mathbf{S})^{-1}$ . The pseudocode for the detailed implementation of PR splitting in Equation (7) can be found in Appendix F.1.

Remark 1. Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting is another option for solving MIGNN which often enjoys better convergence results than PR. In our case, since PR splitting is contractive, PR is always faster than DR for the same  $\alpha$ . However, since the Lipschitz constant  $L = \| \boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{G}^{\top} \otimes \boldsymbol{W}\|$  varies drastically when  $\boldsymbol{W}$  uses the monotone parametrization, we leave it as a future work to study if DR allows for efficient scheduling of  $\alpha$  to accelerate the overall training of MIGNN.

In addition to fast convergence, PR splitting also benefits MIGNNs in learning LRD. To see this, we have the following Neumann series expansion of  $V(\boldsymbol{u}^k)$

$$
\boldsymbol {V} \left(\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}\right) = \left(\boldsymbol {I} + \alpha \left(\boldsymbol {I} - \boldsymbol {G} ^ {\top} \otimes \boldsymbol {W}\right)\right) ^ {- 1} \left(\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}\right) = \frac {1}{1 + \alpha} \left(\boldsymbol {I} - \frac {\boldsymbol {G} ^ {\top} \otimes \boldsymbol {W}}{1 + 1 / \alpha}\right) ^ {- 1} \left(\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}\right) = \frac {1}{1 + \alpha} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\infty} \frac {\operatorname {v e c} \left(\boldsymbol {W} ^ {i} \boldsymbol {U} ^ {k} \boldsymbol {G} ^ {i}\right)}{(1 + 1 / \alpha) ^ {i}} \tag {8}
$$

where the last equality follows from  $(\mathbf{A} \otimes \mathbf{B})^k = \mathbf{A}^k \otimes \mathbf{B}^k$ , and  $(\mathbf{A} \otimes \mathbf{B})\mathrm{vec}(\mathbf{C}) = \mathrm{vec}(\mathbf{BCA}^\top)$  for  $\forall \mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}$  and  $\mathbf{C}$  that satisfy dimensional consistency. Equation (8) indicates that each node can access information from its  $\infty$ -hop neighbors in a single PR iteration. Evaluating  $\frac{1}{1 + \alpha}\left(I - \frac{\mathbf{G}^\top \otimes \mathbf{W}}{1 + 1 / \alpha}\right)^{-1}(\mathbf{u}^k)$  can be carried out by using Bartels-Stewart algorithm [10]. In particular, we convert computing  $\mathbf{V}$  into diagonalizing the matrix  $\mathbf{G}^\top$  and  $\mathbf{W}$ , respectively. From Equation (8), we have

$$
\boldsymbol {V} \left(\operatorname {v e c} \left(\boldsymbol {U} ^ {k}\right)\right) = \frac {1}{1 + \alpha} \operatorname {v e c} \left(\boldsymbol {Q} _ {\boldsymbol {W}} \left[ \boldsymbol {H} \odot \left(\boldsymbol {Q} _ {\boldsymbol {W}} ^ {- 1} \boldsymbol {U} ^ {k} \boldsymbol {Q} _ {\boldsymbol {G} ^ {\top}}\right) \right] \boldsymbol {Q} _ {\boldsymbol {G} ^ {\top}} ^ {\top}\right) \tag {9}
$$

where  $Q_{G^{\top}} \Lambda_{G^{\top}} Q_{G^{\top}}^{\top}$  and  $Q_W \Lambda_W Q_W^{-1}$  are the eigen-decomposition of  $G^{\top}$  and of  $W$ , respectively, and  $H \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  whose  $(i,j)$ -th entry is  $H_{ij} = 1 / (1 - \frac{1}{1 + 1 / \alpha} (\Lambda_W)_{ii} (\Lambda_{G^{\top}})_{jj})$ . We provide a proof of Equation (9) in Appendix E.4. According to Equation (9), one only needs to calculate the eigen-decomposition of  $G$  once prior to training and the eigen-decomposition of  $W$  once per epoch. The above matrix inversion procedure echos the idea of EIGNN [48]. MIGNN has multiple layers with each fixed point iteration representing one layer. In contrast EIGNN is reducible to a one-layer model; see Appendix A.2 for details on EIGNN.

Remark 2. The graph-related matrix  $G$  is symmetric and hence admits an eigen-decomposition. Also, the weight matrix  $W$  is always diagonalizable when using an orthogonal parametrization. In the case of monotone parametrization for  $W$ , we will symmetrize it as  $\frac{1}{2} (\bar{W} + \bar{W}^{\top})$ .

Although PR splitting can capture LRD in a single iteration, computing  $V$  in Equation (7) requires computationally prohibitive matrix inversion. We provide two remedies for addressing this issue: 1) We use Neumann series expansion to approximate the matrix inversion when orthogonal parameterization is used. 2) We replace the graph-related matrix  $G$  with a generalized graph diffusion convolution matrix, e.g. heat kernel or the personalized PageRank [27; 26].

Neumann series approximation. In the orthogonal parameterization of  $\mathbf{W}$  we have  $\| \frac{\mathbf{G}^{\top} \otimes \mathbf{W}}{1 + 1 / \alpha} \| < 1$ , ensuring efficient approximation of  $\mathbf{V}$  in Equation (7) using only a few terms of its Neumann series expansion. The  $K$ -th order Neumann series expansion of  $\mathbf{V}(\mathrm{vec}(\mathbf{U}^{k}))$  is

$$
\boldsymbol {N} _ {K} (\operatorname {v e c} (\boldsymbol {U})) := \frac {1}{1 + \alpha} \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {K} \frac {\operatorname {v e c} \left(\boldsymbol {W} ^ {i} \boldsymbol {U} ^ {k} \boldsymbol {G} ^ {i}\right)}{(1 + 1 / \alpha) ^ {i}}. \tag {10}
$$

According to Equation (7), the  $K$ -th order Neumann series approximated PR iteration function, denoted as  $\tilde{F}_{\alpha}^{\mathrm{PR,K}}$ , can be written as follows

$$
\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k + 1} := \tilde {F} _ {\alpha} ^ {\mathrm {P R}, \mathrm {K}} (\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}) = 2 N _ {K} \left(2 \operatorname {p r o x} _ {f} ^ {\alpha} (\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}) - \boldsymbol {u} ^ {k} + \alpha \operatorname {v e c} (g _ {B} (\boldsymbol {X}))\right) - 2 \operatorname {p r o x} _ {f} ^ {\alpha} (\boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}) + \boldsymbol {u} ^ {k}. \tag {11}
$$

Each node can access information from its  $K$ -hop neighbors using the  $K$ -th order Neumann series approximated PR iteration, which is more efficient than the existing IGNN. Also, such a treatment can significantly accelerate the forward propagation, and we can intuitively understand this as follows: Each iteration of MIGNN, with  $K$ -th order Neumann series approximated PR iteration, aggregates information from  $K$ -hop neighbors, enabling the use of much fewer iterations than that of IGNN which aggregates one hop per iteration. For the same number of hops, MIGNN can work with a much smaller  $\lambda_{1}(|W|)$  than IGNN, meaning MIGNN converges much faster than IGNN.

MIGNN with diffusion convolution. We can also improve MIGNNs for learning LRD using graph diffusion convolution [27], i.e. instead of using  $\hat{\pmb{A}}$  or  $\pmb{L}$  defined in the previous context, we can set  $\pmb{G}$  to be the combination of higher powers of  $\hat{\pmb{A}}$  or  $\pmb{L}$ , making each node to aggregate multi-hops neighbors' features in each iteration. In particular, we let  $\pmb{G} = \tilde{\pmb{D}}^{-1/2}(\pmb{A} + \dots + \pmb{A}^P)\tilde{\pmb{D}}^{-1/2}$  for any positive integer  $P$ , where  $\tilde{\pmb{D}}$  is the degree matrix with  $D_{ii} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sum_{k=1}^{P} (\pmb{A}^k)_{ij}$ ; other choices of  $\pmb{G}$  can be found in [27]. We can show that the eigenvalues of  $\tilde{\pmb{D}}^{-1/2}(\pmb{A} + \dots + \pmb{A}^P)\tilde{\pmb{D}}^{-1/2}$  are all within  $[-1, 1]$ ; see E.4 for a proof. As such, the orthogonal parameterization of  $\pmb{W}$  still ensures the well-posedness of MIGNN. We write the MIGNN with  $P$ -th order diffusion matrix  $\pmb{G}$  as follows

$$
\boldsymbol {Z} = \sigma \left(\boldsymbol {W} \boldsymbol {Z} \tilde {\boldsymbol {D}} ^ {- 1 / 2} \left(\boldsymbol {A} + \boldsymbol {A} ^ {2} + \dots + \boldsymbol {A} ^ {P}\right) \tilde {\boldsymbol {D}} ^ {- 1 / 2} + g _ {B} (\boldsymbol {X})\right). \tag {12}
$$

We can further apply the operator splitting schemes to Equation (12), in particular, we denote the model as MIGNN-NKDP when Equation (12) is implemented by using the  $P$ -th order diffusion and the  $K$ -th order Neumann series approximated PR iteration.

# 4.1.3 ANDERSON ACCELERATION

We have already seen that the main steps in both FB and PR splitting schemes involve solving iterative equations, e.g. Equations (6) and (7), and we can utilize Anderson acceleration [3] to accelerate the convergence of these iterative equations. In particular, recent progress [21; 30; 9] on DEQ has shown that, with limited memory overhead, the Anderson accelerating schemes can effectively obtain an accurate fixed point with reduced number of iterations compared to the vanilla schemes. We provide the detailed formulation and pseudocode for Anderson accelerated operator splitting-based MIGNNs in Appendix F.3.

# 4.2 BACKWARD PROPAGATION FOR UPDATING MIGNNS

We derive backpropagation for MIGNN based on implicit differentiation [28; 6; 22]. Recall that the vectorized MIGNN  $\operatorname{vec}(Z) = \sigma\left(G^{\top} \otimes W \operatorname{vec}(Z) + \operatorname{vec}(g_B(X))\right)$ , has equilibrium point  $\operatorname{vec}(Z^{*})$ . For any loss function  $\ell$  and any parameter  $\theta$  ( $W$  or  $B$ ), we have

$$
\frac {\partial \ell}{\partial \theta} = \frac {\partial \ell}{\partial \operatorname {v e c} \left(\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {*}\right)} \left(\boldsymbol {I} - \boldsymbol {J} \left(\boldsymbol {G} ^ {\top} \otimes \boldsymbol {W}\right)\right) ^ {- 1} \frac {\partial \sigma \left(\boldsymbol {G} ^ {\top} \otimes \boldsymbol {W} \operatorname {v e c} \left(\boldsymbol {Z} ^ {*}\right) + \operatorname {v e c} \left(g _ {\boldsymbol {B}} (\boldsymbol {X})\right)\right)}{\partial \theta} \tag {13}
$$

where  $J$  is the Jacobian of  $\sigma$  evaluated at  $G^{\top} \otimes W\mathrm{vec}(Z^{*}) + \mathrm{vec}(g_{B}(X))$ . The values of the first and last term in Equation (13) can be found through automatic differentiation by running one more iteration in the forward pass. Note that the product of the first two terms remains the same for any  $\theta$ . Hence one only needs to compute it once in each backward pass. However, it can still be expensive to find  $(\partial \ell) / (\partial \mathrm{vec}(Z^{*}))(I - J(G^{\top} \otimes W))^{-1}$ . Following [65, Theorem 2], the operator splitting methods can be used in the backward pass so that computing  $(I - J(G^{\top} \otimes W))^{-1}$  can be converted into computing  $V = (I - (G^{\top} \otimes W))^{-1}$ , which is already calculated in the forward pass; see Appendix F.2. Similar to the forward propagation, the backpropagation can also benefit from Anderson acceleration using an iterative formulation, and we provide more details in Appendix F.2.

# 5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, we compare the performance of MIGNNs using different parameterizations and operator splitting treatments with IGNN and several other popular GNNs on various graph classification tasks at both node and graph levels. We aim to show the practical advantages of MIGNNs in learning LRD, expressivity, and computational efficiency over IGNNs — to resonate with our theoretical results. All MIGNNs studied in this section are implemented by the Anderson accelerated operator splitting schemes, and we omit Anderson acceleration when describing the model for the sake of presentation. We show that 1) MIGNNs with orthogonal parameterization using different operator splitting schemes can effectively learn LRD with improved computational efficiency and accuracy compared to IGNNs, and 2) monotone parameterization can make MIGNNs more expressive than IGNNs on a few benchmark graph classification tasks. We set the tolerance of the fixed-point related solvers to be 1e-6 measured in the  $\ell_{\infty}$ -norm of the difference between two consecutive fixed point iterations. We conduct all experiments using NVIDIA RTX 3090 graphics cards.

# 5.1 DIRECTED CHAIN CLASSIFICATION

To show MIGNNs can capture LRD in the underlying graphs, we test them on the synthetic chain task using the experimental setup from [48]. The dataset in the chain task comprises of  $c$  classes and  $n_c$  single-linked directed chains each containing  $l$  nodes. For each chain, only the feature on the first node encodes the label information. The data is partitioned into training, validation, and test sets of  $5\%$ ,  $10\%$ , and  $85\%$ , respectively.

We consider both binary  $(c = 2)$  and three-class classification  $(c = 3)$  problems over several different chain lengths. For IGNN, we use the experimental settings used in [59]. For MIGNN, we parameterize  $W$  by the scaled Cayley map in Equation (4) and set  $\pmb{G}$  to be the  $P$ -th order diffusion matrix as that in Equation (12), then we implement MIGNN using the  $K$ -th order Neumann series approximated PR iteration, i.e. we consider MIGNN-NKDP for this task. Fig. 3 shows the averaged test accuracy over 5 random seeds of different models for classifying directed chains of length ranging from 50 to 300 in an increment of 50 for the binary case and from 40 to 200 in an increment of 20 for the three-class case. For binary case, MIGNN-N3D3 and MIGNN-N3D5 both score perfectly for all random initializations of the considered chain lengths. For the three-class case, both MIGNN models are able to achieve high accuracy consistently with the higher order diffusion models, and the higher order diffusion model outperforms the lower order diffusion model on longer chains. In contrast, the accuracy of IGNN is much lower than that of MIGNNs, and in general IGNN's performance becomes worse as the chain length increases.

We can also set  $G$  to be the diffusion matrix in Equation (12) to enhance IGNN's capability in learning LRD. E.g. we can equip IGNN with a diffusion matrix of order 5, and we denote the resulting model as IGNN-D5. Fig. 3 further contrasts the performance of IGNN-D5 with MIGNNs, showing that MIGNNs outperform IGNN-D5 and the margin gets wider as the chain length increases.

Based on the operator splitting theory, we expect that MIGNNs are more computationally efficient than IGNN. Fig. 4 compares the computational efficiency of MIGNN over IGNN for both binary (row 1) and three-class (row 2) classification tasks. For both tasks the maximum number of allowed iterations is set to be 300. The binary task considers chain length 250 of an initialization where IGNN is capable of attaining high accuracy, which notably may not always be true for IGNN. The point at which IGNN is capable of attaining high accuracy, it also requires maximum allowable iterations, and there is no guarantee of fixed-point convergence. In contrast, the MIGNN model is able to achieve perfect accuracy while maintaining an average of 200 iterations. Similar results are reported for the three-class classification task with chain length 160 (row 2 in Fig. 4).

# 5.2 GRAPH CLASSIFICATION

In this subsection, we verify that MIGNN with monotone parameterization, i.e.  $\boldsymbol{W} = (1 - m)\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{C}\boldsymbol{C}^{\top} + \boldsymbol{F} - \boldsymbol{F}^{\top}$  as that in Proposition 2, can be more expressive than IGNN since the eigenvalue of monotone parameterization is more flexible than that of IGNN. We implement MIGNN with the above parameterization using Anderson accelerated FB splitting, and we denote the corresponding MIGNN model as MIGNN-Symm. We consider five bioinformatics-related graph classification benchmarks: MUTAG, PTC, COX2, PROTEINS, and NCI1 [69], and some details of

![](images/988326e15414b15184b1e70c0f2d12e33044f88ef14ee05121e4b62ba23326b7.jpg)

these datasets are provided in Appendix H. The training is performed using 10-fold cross-validation using the experimental setup of [59]. The averaged test accuracy and standard deviation across the 10 folds is shown in Table 1. For both IGNN and MIGNN-Symm, we use the hyper-parameters outlined in [59]. We present the results for both IGNN and MIGNN-Symm in Table 1. Clearly, MIGNN-Symm outperforms IGNN on all tasks. To verify our theory, we report on the evolution of  $\lambda_{1}(|W|)$  for three of the ten folds of MUTAG in Fig. 5. For all of the folds  $\lambda_{1}(|W|)$  exceeds one. We further test the performance of MIGNN-NKDP for the above graph classification task using the same hyper-parameters as that for MIGNN-Symm. Table 1 also reports the accuracy of MIGNN-N1D1 against several baseline models. MIGNN-N1D1 performs better than IGNN on all tasks and achieves the best accuracy on COX2 and PROTEINS tasks among all studied models.

# 5.3 LARGER SCALE GRAPH NODE CLASSIFICATION

In this subsection, we show the advantages of MIGNNs over IGNN and other GNNs for a larger scale graph node classification task — Amazon co-purchasing dataset, which contains 334863 nodes, 925872 edges, and the diameter of the graph is 44 [70]. We provide some more details of the Amazon co-purchasing dataset in Appendix H. The features of the dataset are learned at training time. However, as in [18] we train on portions of the graph ranging from  $5\%$  to  $9\%$ , and test on sets representing  $10\%$  of the total graph. We then report both Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 consistent with [59]. Fig. 6 contrasts the computational cost of MIGNN-N1D1 with IGNN using  $5\%$  of the graph for training.  $\lambda_{1}(|W|)$  of MIGNN-N1D1 is much smaller than that of IGNN, implying faster convergence of MIGNN-N1D1 than IGNN as confirmed by the fact that MIGNN-N1D1 saves significantly on the number of iterations and computational time over IGNN.

enjoys significant computational advantages over IGNN.

# 5.4 PHYSICAL DIFFUSION IN NETWORKS

We further consider a physical problem of fluid flow in porous media, following [52]. The model is a 3D graph whose nodes and edges correspond to pore chambers and throats. We sample training graphs of different sizes between 100 and 500, which are generated to fit into 0.1  $\mathrm{m}^3$  cubes. We employ MIGNN to predict the equilibrium pressures  $Z^{*}$  inside pore networks  $G$ . We train MIGNN such that it minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE) between the predicted ones and  $Z^{*}$ . We utilize the experimental setup of [52] and include their reported results for IGNN. Both IGNN and MIGNN use the same encoder and decoder architecture. Graphs of 50 - 200 nodes are sampled in training and 1000 test graphs are generated

![](images/ebf80c63d9e9c43b3a8440a98e8ab3c07d7d3a730b846f6c24ff9aa7c080a985.jpg)  
Figure 8: The average MSE of 500 sampled test iterations vs. the number of pores. The error bars represent the standard error of the prediction. MIGNN with different parameterizations outperform IGNN by a significant amount.

for pore counts from 200 to 500. Fig. 8 shows the MSE for the test graphs as the number of nodes (pores) varies from 200 to 500. MIGNN with both monotone and orthogonal parameterizations outperform IGNN by a significant margin. For this task of learning physical diffusion in networks, CGS [52] performs better than MIGNN and IGNN in accuracy. As a future direction, we plan to integrate the idea of the learnable graph-related matrix  $\mathbf{G}$  that is used in CGS with our proposed MIGNN to further improve the performance of MIGNN for learning physical diffusion in networks.

# 6 CONCLUDING REMARKS

We propose MIGNN based on a maximal monotone operator viewpoint of IGNN. In particular, MIGNN can be parameterized more flexibly than the benchmark IGNN. We provide efficient implementations of MIGNN that integrates diffusion convolution leveraging different operator splitting schemes with Anderson acceleration. Numerically, MIGNN remarkably outperforms existing IGNN in accuracy, stability, computational efficiency, and learning LRD. As IGNNs are closely related to RNNs, an interesting future direction is to explore if the ideas from other RNN architectures [34; 49] can be adapted to the improvement of IGNNs.
