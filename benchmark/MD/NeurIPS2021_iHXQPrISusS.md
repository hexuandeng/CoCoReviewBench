# Abstract

The goal of self-supervised visual representation learning is to learn strong, transferable image representations, with the majority of research focusing on object or scene level. On the other hand, representation learning at part level has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to object part discovery and segmentation and make three contributions. First, we construct a proxy task through a set of objectives that encourages the model to learn a meaningful decomposition of the image into its parts. Secondly, prior work argues for reconstructing or clustering pre-computed features as a proxy to parts; we show empirically that this alone is unlikely to find meaningful parts; mainly because of their low resolution and the tendency of classification networks to spatially smear out information. We suggest that image reconstruction at the level of pixels can alleviate this problem, acting as a complementary cue. Lastly, we show that the standard evaluation based on keypoint regression does not correlate well with segmentation quality and thus introduce different metrics, NMI and ARI, that better characterize the decomposition of objects into parts. Our method yields semantic parts which are consistent across fine-grained but visually distinct categories, outperforming the state of the art on three benchmark datasets.

# 1 Introduction

We consider the problem of the automated discovery of the parts of visual object classes: given a collection of images of a certain object category (e.g., birds) and corresponding object masks, we want to learn automatically a collection of repeatable and informative parts that decompose these objects.

Automated part discovery requires suitable inductive principles. For example, several authors have noted that geometric properties such as keypoints and parts are equivariant to transformations of the image (e.g., rotating an image should cause all part responses to rotate as well). However, equivariance is generally insufficient for learning such primitives. In the case of parts, for example, equivariance can be trivially obtained by assigning all pixels in an image to the same part.

Previous works have suggested that useful cues for part discovery can be obtained from pre-trained neural networks. These networks can in fact be used as a dense feature extractors and the feature responses can be clustered or otherwise decomposed to identify parts [10, 26]. In particular, [26] learn part prototypes, and make the latter orthogonal to avoid parts collapsing into a single one.

In this paper, we revisit and improve such concepts. First, we suggest that contrastive learning can be employed as an effective tool to decompose objects in diverse and yet consistent parts. In particular, we seek parts whose feature responses are homogeneous within the same or different occurrences of the same part type, while at the same time being distinctive for different types of parts. However, a direct application of this contrastive principle would lead to consider an unmanageable number

of feature comparisons, quadratic in the number of pixels in the dataset. To address this issue, we note that, if part responses are indeed homogeneous, their features are well approximated by a single average vector. Using this fact, we reduce the complexity of the formulation to quadratic in the number of part occurrences (much smaller than the number of pixels), further reduced to linear via subsampling. Differently from [26], the resulting contrastive formulation does not require to learn part prototypes, nor to add additional part diversity constraints, such as orthogonality.

A second contribution is to discuss whether clustering pre-trained features is indeed sufficient for part discovery. To this end, we show that simply clustering dense features sometimes captures obviously self-similar structures, such as image edges, rather than meaningful parts (Section 3.2). This is somewhat intrinsic to using pre-trained feed-forward local features, as these can only analyse a fixed image neighborhood and thus pick up the pattern which is most obvious within their aperture. As a complementary cue, we thus suggest to look at the visual consistency of parts. The idea is that most parts are visually homogeneous, sharing a color or texture. A generative model of the part appearance may thus be able to detect part membership at the level of individual pixels by deciding which pixels belong to a given texture. We show, in particular, that even very simple models that assume color consistency are complementary and beneficial when added to feature-based grouping.

Finally, we consider the problem of assessing automated part discovery. An issue is the relative scarcity of data labelled with part segmentation. Another one, technically more challenging, is the fact that parts that are discovered automatically may be internally consistent and yet may not correspond to the parts that a human annotator would assign to an image. This makes using manual part annotations for evaluation tricky. Prior work in the area has thus assessed the discovered parts via proxy tasks, such as learning keypoint predictors, using supervision. The idea is that, if parts are consistent, they should be good predictors of other geometric primitives. An added benefit is that there are several datasets with keypoint annotations. Unfortunately, as we show empirically, transferring parts to keypoints is unlikely to provide a meaningful test for the quality of the parts. We show, for instance, that knowledge of a single keypoint provides a better predictor of other keypoints that any of the previous unsupervised parts.

To address this issue, we propose a new evaluation protocol. We still use keypoints as they are readily available, or ground-truth part segmentation when possible; however, instead of learning to regress such ground truth annotations, we simply measure the co-occurrence statistics of the predicted parts and these annotations using Normalized Mutual Information and Adjusted Rand Index. The latter requires the learned parts to be geometrically consistent and distinctive regardless of whether they are in one-to-one correspondence with manually-provided labels and results in a more meaningful measure for this task.

Empirically, we demonstrate that these improvements lead to stronger automated part discovery than prior work on standard benchmarks.

Part discovery and segmentation. Prior to deep learning, part-based models [11, 13-15] played a major role in problems such as object detection and recognition. In the deep learning era, part discovery remains an integral part of fine-grained recognition, where it acts as an intermediary step with or without part-level supervision [5, 17, 25, 30, 31, 33, 45, 54, 56, 58-60, 62, 65, 66]. However, all these methods require joint training with image labels and focus mostly on discovering the most informative (discriminative) regions to help with the classification task.

Unlike previous methods, our goal is to discover independent and semantically consistent parts without image-level or part-level labels. Though supervised methods that learn from annotated part segments do exist [27, 32, 48, 52], Bau et al. [1] and Gonzalez-Garcia et al. [19] inspect the hidden units of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with image-level supervision (e.g., on ImageNet [41]) to understand whether part detectors emerge in them systematically. This is done by measuring the alignment between each unit and a set of dense part labels, and as such, the availability of manual annotations is required for interpretation. Most related to our work, however, are approaches for unsupervised part segmentation [2, 10, 26, 43]. Based on the observation of [1, 19] that semantic parts do indeed emerge in deep features, Collins et al. [10] propose to use non-negative matrix factorization to decompose a pre-trained CNN's activations into parts. Similar observations had been previously discussed in [43] for constructing part constellations models and in [53] for

part detection via feature clustering. To learn part segmentations in an unsupervised manner, Braun et al. [2] propose a probabilistic generative model to disentangle shape and appearance, but focus mostly on human body parts. Lastly, closest to our work is SCOPS by Hung et al. [26]; SCOPS is a self-supervised approach for object part segmentation from an image collection of the same coarse category, e.g., birds. The authors propose a set of loss functions to train a model to output part segments that obey semantic, geometric and equivariance constraints.

Other recent methods [47, 64] use generative adversarial networks for few-shot part segmentation, while [16] discover parts without supervision by interacting with articulated objects, and [34, 42, 57] from motion in videos.

Self-supervised and contrastive learning. In self-supervised learning, one typically aims to design pretext tasks [12, 18, 38, 39, 61] for pre-training; in order to solve these, the model has to capture useful information about the data. Contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in self-supervised learning in computer vision, with several methods [7, 22-24, 29, 37, 49, 55] learning strong image representations that transfer to downstream tasks. The key idea in contrastive learning is to encode two similar data points with similar embeddings, while pushing the embeddings of dissimilar data further apart [20]. In absence of labels, most contrastive methods use heavy data augmentations to create different views of the same image to use as a positive pair and are trained to minimize different variants of the InfoNCE loss [49]. As these methods learn an embedding for every pixel, they cannot be directly applied for part segmentation and need either fine-tuning or a clustering step to produce part masks.

We instead follow an approach tor contrastive learning that is more tailored to semantic part segmentation, i.e. taking into consideration the dense nature of this problem. Our method is thus also related to self-supervised learning of dense representations [28, 40, 50].

# 3 Method

Given a collection of images centered around a given type of objects (e.g., birds), we wish to learn automatically a part detector, assigning each pixel of the objects to one of  $K$  semantic parts. Formally, we model the part segmentation task as predicting a mask  $M \in \{0,1\}^{K \times H \times W}$  for an image  $I \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times H \times W}$ , where  $\sum_{k=1}^{K} M_u = 1$  for all pixels  $u \in \{0,\dots,H-1\} \times \{0,\dots,W-1\}$ . The mask thus assigns each pixel  $u$  to one of  $K$  parts and the part segmenter is a function  $f: I \mapsto M$ , implemented as a deep neural network, that maps an image  $I$  to its part mask  $M$ . The mask is relaxed and computed in a differentiable manner, by applying the softmax operator at each pixel.

Since we are tackling this task without supervision, we have to construct a proxy task that will enforce  $f$  to learn a meaningful decomposition of the image into its parts without the need for labelled examples. The rest of the section defines this task.

# 3.1 Contrastive feature discovery

Following prior work [10, 26], our primary cue for discovering parts is a deep feature extractor  $\phi$ , obtained as a neural network pre-trained on an off-the-shelf benchmark such as ImageNet, possibly in a self-supervised manner. In order to obtain repeatable and distinctive parts from these features, we propose to use a contrastive formulation [24, 49].

To this end, Let  $[\phi(I)]_u \in \mathbb{R}^d$  be the feature vector associated by the network to pixel location  $u$  in the image. The idea is that, if pixel  $v$  belongs to the same part type as  $u$ , then their feature vectors should be very similar when contrasted to the case in which  $v$  belong to a different part type. Since parts should be consistent irrespective of the particular object instance, comparisons extend within each image  $I$ , but also across different images. Thus, a naive application of this idea would require a number of comparison proportional to the square of the number of pixels in the dataset, which is impractical. We could, of course, randomly subsample pixels, but this would require to backpropagate through the sampling process which, while feasible, adds to the complexity of the method.

Instead, we approach this issue by noting that contrastive learning would encourage features that belong to the same part type to be similar. This is even more true for features that belong to the same part occurrence in a specific image. We can thus summarize the code for part  $k$  in image  $I$  via an average part descriptor  $z_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ :

$$
z _ {k} (I) = \frac {1}{\left| M _ {k} \right|} \sum_ {u \in \Omega} M _ {k u} [ \phi (I) ] _ {u}, \quad \left| M _ {k} \right| = \sum_ {u \in \Omega} M _ {k u}. \tag {1}
$$

We can then directly enforce the fact that pixels within that part occurrence respond with similar features by minimizing the variance of descriptors within the part:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {f} (M) = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \sum_ {u \in \Omega} M _ {k u} \| z _ {k} (I) - [ \phi (I) ] _ {u} \| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {2}
$$

By doing so, we obtain two advantages. First, pixels are assigned to the same part occurrence if they have similar feature vectors, as contrastive learning would do. Second, the part occurrence is now summarized by a single average descriptor vector  $z_{k}(I)$  which has a differentiable dependency on the mask. Next, we show how we can express the 'rest' of the contrastive learning loss as a function of these differentiable part occurrence summaries.

To this end, we use a random set (e.g., the mini-batch) of other images. Intuitively, we would like to maximize the semantic similarity between all the  $k$ -th parts across images and analogously minimize the semantic similarity between all other parts. This score is computed over a batch of  $N$  images, each with  $K$  descriptors  $z_{k}^{(n)}$ , where  $n$  indexes the image/part occurrence (each part type occurs once in each image). To reduce the number of comparisons, for each part  $k$  we randomly choose a target  $\hat{z}_{k}^{(n)} \in \{z_{k}^{(i)}\}_{i \neq n}$  out of the  $N - 1$  other part  $k$  occurrences in the batch. With this, the contrastive loss can be written as usual:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {c} = - \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \log \frac {\exp \left(z _ {k} ^ {(n)} \cdot \hat {z} _ {k} ^ {(n)} / \tau\right)}{\exp \left(z _ {k} ^ {(n)} \cdot \hat {z} _ {k} ^ {(n)} / \tau\right) + \sum_ {j \neq k} \sum_ {i \neq m} \exp \left(z _ {k} ^ {(n)} \cdot z _ {j} ^ {(i)} / \tau\right)}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $\tau$  is a temperature hyper-parameter that controls the "peakyness" of the similarity metric.

Note that, while this score function resembles the typical contrastive formulation in current self-supervised approaches, instead of generating the target  $\hat{\hat{z}}_k^{(n)}$  as an augmentation of the original image, here we can actually use a different image, since part  $k$  should have the same semantic meaning in both images. This formulation implicitly encourages two properties. On one hand, it maximizes the similarity of the same part type across images, and on the other hand, it maximizes the dissimilarity of different part types in the same and other images.

# 3.2 Visual consistency

We suggest that an effective remedy is to look for the visual consistency of the part itself. We can in fact expect most part occurrences to be characterized by a homogeneous texture. Generative modelling can then be used to assign individual pixels to different part regions based on how well they fit each part appearance.

This signal is in part complementary to feature-based grouping. As shown to the right by clustering features from successive layers in the VGG-16 network (relu3_2, relu4_3, relu5_2, relu5_4) pre-trained on ImageNet, when the receptive field of the features straddles two or

![](images/735df4eb091e9b7c6b5cdedd1c1d5023c36d162d877451dc61556d9032319c82.jpg)

more parts, grouping may sometimes highlight self-similar structures such as region boundaries instead of parts. On the other hand, pixels can almost always attributed uniquely to a single part.

In our experiments, we show that even the simplest possible generative model, which assumes that pixels are i.i.d. samples from identical Gaussians, helps improving the consistency of the discovered parts. The negative log likelihood of parts under this simple model is given by the loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {v} (M) = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \sum_ {u \in \Omega} M _ {k u} \left\| I _ {u} - \frac {1}{\left| M _ {k} \right|} \sum_ {v \in \Omega} M _ {k v} I _ {v} \right\| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {4}
$$

In other words, the expectation is that parts would be roughly uniformly colored.

# 3.3 Transformation equivariance

Finally, we make use of the fact that an image transformation should not change the assignment of pixels to parts. We thus sample a random image transformation  $T$  and minimize the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence  $\mathcal{KL}$  between the original mask and the mask predicted from the transformed image

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {e} (I, T (I)) = \sum_ {u \in \Omega} \mathcal {K L} \left(T _ {u} (f (I)), f _ {u} (T (I))\right) + \mathcal {K L} \left(f _ {u} (T (I)), T _ {u} (f (I))\right). \tag {5}
$$

Here the  $\mathcal{KL}$  divergence is computed per pixel, using the fact that the model predicts, via the softmax operator, a probability distribution over possible parts at each image location. This objective encourages commutativity of the function  $f$  with respect to the transformation as it is minimized if  $T(f(I)) = f(T(I))$ , on in other words, equivariance under image transformations.

Note that, for equivariance, we need to define the action of  $T$  on both the input image  $I$  and the output  $f(I)$ . We consider simple random geometric warps (affine), which are applicable to any image-like tensor (thus even the pixels-wise predictions  $f(I)$ ). We also consider photometric augmentations (e.g., color jitter), whose corresponding action in output space is the identity, because we wish the network to learn to be invariant to these effects (they do not change the part identity or location).

# 3.4 Overall objective

We learn  $f$  by minimizing the weighted sum of the prior losses:  $\lambda_{f}\mathcal{L}_{f} + \lambda_{c}\mathcal{L}_{c} + \lambda_{v}\mathcal{L}_{v} + \lambda_{e}\mathcal{L}_{e}$ .

# 4 Experiments

In the following we validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200 dataset (CUB-200-2011) [51], the large-scale fashion database (DeepFashion) [35] and PASCALPart [8]. Details regarding the datasets are given in the appendix. We carry out ablation experiments to study (a) the importance of the proposed objective functions, and (b) the role of supervised vs. unsupervised pre-training for the different components of our model. Lastly, we show that our method compares favorably to prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Implementation details. We model  $f$  as a deep neural network, specifically a DeepLab-v2 [6] with ResNet-50 [21] as backbone, as it is a standard architecture for semantic image segmentation. Following SCOPS [26] we choose a VGG19 [44] as the perceptual network  $\phi$ . Unless otherwise specified the backbone and perceptual network are pre-trained on ImageNet with image-level supervision.

Table 1: Comparison to prior work on CUB-200-2011 [51]. We report keypoint localization error as the normalized L2 distance (\%), as well as NMI and ARI scores. All methods predict  $K = 4$  parts.  ${}^{ \dagger  }$  uses image-level supervision.

We use the same set of hyper-parameters for both, CUB-200 and Deep-Fashion, whereas some small changes are necessary for PASCAL-Part since the images are in a different resolution which typically impacts the magnitude of feature-based losses. We provide all implementation details in the appendix.

# 4.1 Evaluation Metrics

Prior work on unsupervised part segmentation [26] compares against unsupervised landmark regression methods [46, 63], due to the similarity between the two tasks and the limited availability of annotations.

We begin by taking a critical look at the evaluation metric that has been previously used in [26], i.e. landmark regression error. We evaluate several baselines on CUB-200-2011 — namely, using the image midpoint, the average of ground truth keypoints and a single selected ground truth keypoint — and find that this metric does not correlate well with segmentation performance. For example, if we assume a model can accurately predict one single keypoint and nothing else (in this case the "throat"), the keypoint regression error is already lower than the previous state of the art. This means that a model that predicts one good part and  $K - 1$  random parts would already outperform all previous methods. Thus, the metric does not sufficiently measure the segmentation aspect of the task, which is the main goal of our method, as well as in [10, 25, 26].

Instead, we propose to measure the information overlap between the predicted labeling and the ground truth with Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) as we find this does not suffer from this drawback. Comparing to Intersection-over-Union (IoU), which is commonly used to evaluate segmentation and detection performance, in an unsupervised setting NMI and ARI have the advantage that they do not require the ground truth annotation to align exactly with the discovered parts and do not impose a constraint in the value of  $K$ , i.e. it does not need to be the same as the number of annotated categories. We propose to compute the NMI and ARI metrics not only on the full image, but also on the foreground pixels only (FG-NMI, FG-ARI). This is a stricter metric that puts the attention on part quality, dampening the influence of the background, which can be usually predicted with high accuracy using state-of-the-art segmentation or saliency methods. Importantly, these metrics can be computed even if a subset of the pixels are annotated in the dataset, and in particular if only keypoints annotations are available.

# 4.2 Ablation Experiments

In Table 2 we evaluate the different objectives used to train our model. We first deactivate each loss and measure the impact it has on performance in two datasets, CUB-200-2011 and DeepFashion. Interestingly, we find that the different components differ in importance across the two datasets, even though we use the same hyper-parameters for both. On CUB-200-2011, the most important component is to enforce consistency within parts, whereas on DeepFashion visual consistency appears to have the largest impact. This likely comes from the different nature of "parts" in these two datasets.

Table 2: Ablation. We remove various parts of our model and measure the decrease in performance. Additionally, we evaluate a baseline where we cluster VGG19 features unsing  $k$ -means.

While our model is unsupervised with respect to part annotations of any form, we analyze its performance when moving from weight initialization with supervised models to weights from unsupervised models. The ablation is shown for  $K = 4$  parts on CUB-200-2011 [51].

For birds, the parts are conceptually defined by shape, function and deformation (which is captured by features), whereas for the fashion dataset, parts such as T-shirts and trousers can be identified by their consistent color and texture (which is better captured by the image). Nonetheless, to achieve maximum performance both components are necessary in both dataset, as well as the equivariance and contrastive terms. To better understand the important of the contrastive formulation, we also devise a modified version of the feature loss to model intra-part consistency, i.e. computing the mean part feature vector not only in a single sample, but across samples in the batch. We refer to this variant as "inter-part consistency loss with  $\mathcal{L}_2$  and note that it performs significantly worse than the full model with the contrastive loss. Finally, we establish a simple baseline by clustering perceptual features of concatenated layers relu5_2, relu5_4 from a VGG19 (same layers as used in [26]) with  $K$ -means ( $K = 4$ ). This simple clustering baseline performs quite well and almost reaches the performance of previous methods (Table 1), but the proposed approach is clearly stronger. Notably, feature clustering results in weaker performance for DeepFashion, which intuitively also explains why within-part consistency  $(\mathcal{L}_f)$  is not the most critical component for this dataset.

# 4.3 Eliminating Supervision

The method we have presented is unsupervised with respect to part annotations. However, similar to previous work [25, 26], we still rely on backbones pre-trained with ImageNet supervision, and foreground-background segmentation masks. In Table 3 we remove these remaining, weakly supervised components step by step and replace them with unsupervised models. We notice, that none of the recent self-supervised methods provides models based on VGG architectures [44], although VGG is considered a much better architecture for perceptual-type losses than ResNet [21]. We thus use a VGG16 from DeepCuster-v1 [3]. For a better comparison we directly compare to a supervised VGG16 and not our final model that uses VGG19. We find that the performance is indeed impacted by changing from supervised to unsupervised visual features  $(-6\mathrm{NMI})$  and by replacing the supervised backbone  $(-5\mathrm{NMI})$ . But the final performance is still competitive with previous methods such as DFF [10] that use ImageNet supervision and masks. Using an unsupervised saliency method [36] for segmentation does not affect the performance very much.

# 4.4 Comparisons with the State of the Art

CUB-200. On CUB-200 (Table 1 and Figure 2), we evaluate keypoint regression performance to be directly comparable to previous work. As keypoint regression has limitations in measuring part segmentation performance, we also evaluate NMI and ARI on both the foreground object on (FG) and the whole image. We use the publicly available checkpoint of SCOPS [26] to compute these new metrics for their method. Additionally, we run DFF [10] using their publicly available code. Finally, we are even able to improve over [25] who use class labels for fine-grained recognition during training.

DeepFashion. Finally, to the right and in Figure 3 we compare on DeepFashion [35], reporting NMI and ARI scores for  $K = 4$  parts. Our model is able to identify more meaningful parts (hair, skin, upper-gramment, lower-garment) than SCOPS.

<table><tr><td></td><td>FG-NMI</td><td>FG-ARI</td><td>NMI</td><td>ARI</td></tr><tr><td>SCOPS [26]</td><td>30.7</td><td>27.6</td><td>56.6</td><td>81.4</td></tr><tr><td>Ours</td><td>44.8</td><td>46.6</td><td>68.1</td><td>90.6</td></tr></table>

Figure 4: PASCAL-Part Dataset. We train one model per class for both, our model and SCOPS [26]. For animals we find are able to separate different body parts. (More examples in the appendix.)

PASCAL-Part. To understand the applicability of the method to a wide variety of objects and animals, we also evaluate on the PASCAL-Part dataset in Table 4 and Figure 4. We train one model per object class, as in [26]. However, we note that Hung et al. [26] only evaluate foreground-background segmentation performance in their paper. We thus train their method on each class and report NMI and ARI for quantitative comparisons. For DFF we perform non-negative matrix factorization on the set of features of each class separately. Our method strikes a significant improvement over prior work in all the classes.

# 5 Discussion

Limitations. Parts discovered in a self-supervised manner might not necessarily agree with expected labels or human intuition. Further, as with all methods that learn from data — and especially in the case of self-supervised learning — it is likely that underlying biases in the data affect the learning process and consequently decisions made by the model. Please see the appendix for qualitative examples of failure cases.

Broader Impact. Supervised learning often requires highly-curated datasets with expensive, time-consuming, manual annotations. This is especially true for pixel-level tasks (e.g., segmentation) or tasks that require expert knowledge (e.g., fine-grained recognition). As a result, increasing attention is being placed on improving image understanding using little or no supervision. Since part segmentation datasets are limited in number and size, a direct positive impact of our approach is that discovering semantic object parts in a self-supervised manner can significantly increase the amount of data that can be leveraged to train such models. Please see the appendix for a complete discussion of the broader impact of this work.

# 6 Conclusion

We have proposed a self-supervised method for discovering and segmenting object parts. We start from the observation, also discussed in prior work [1, 10], that deep CNN layers respond to semantic concepts or parts and thus clustering activations across an image collection amounts to discovering dense correspondences among them. We further expand upon this idea by introducing a contrastive formulation, as well as equivariance and visual consistency constraints. Our method relies only on the availability of foreground/background masks to separate an object of interest from its background. However, as we show experimentally, it is possible to leverage unsupervised saliency models to acquire such masks, which allows for a model that has no supervised components at all.
