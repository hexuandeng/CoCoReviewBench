# ABSTRACT

Effective variational inference crucially depends on a flexible variational family of distributions. Recent work has explored sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) methods to construct variational distributions, which can, in principle, approximate the target posterior arbitrarily well, which is especially appealing for models with inherent sequential structure. However, SMC, which represents the posterior using a weighted set of particles, often suffers from particle weight degeneracy, leading to a large variance of the resulting estimators. To address this issue, we present a novel approach that leverages the idea of partial rejection control (PRC) and enables us to develop a robust variational inference framework. Although PRC constructs a low variance estimator of the marginal likelihood, unbiased estimators are not available in the literature for arbitrary variational posteriors. We solve this issue by employing a dice-enterprise: a generalization of the Bernoulli factory to construct unbiased estimators for SMC-PRC. The resulting variational lower bound can be optimized efficiently with respect to the variational parameters. We show theoretical properties of the lower bound and report experiments on various sequential models, such as the Gaussian state-space model and variational RNN, on which our approach outperforms existing methods.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Exact inference in latent variable models is usually intractable. Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) (Andrieu et al., 2003) and variational methods (Blei et al., 2017), are commonly employed in such models to make inference tractable. While MCMC has been the traditional method of choice, often with provable guarantees, optimization based variational inference (VI) methods have also enjoyed considerable recent interest due to their excellent scalability on large-scale datasets. VI, in particular, is based on maximizing a lower bound constructed through a marginal likelihood estimator. However, for latent variable models with sequential structure, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) (Doucet & Johansen, 2009) returns a much lower variance estimator for the log marginal likelihood than importance sampling (IS) (Bérard et al., 2014; Cérou et al., 2011). In this work, we focus our attention on designing a low variance, unbiased, and computationally efficient estimator of the marginal likelihood.

The performance of SMC based methods is strongly dependent on the choice of the proposal distribution. Inadequate proposal distributions propose values in areas of low probability under the target, leading to particle depletion (Doucet & Johansen, 2009). An effective solution is to use rejection control (Liu et al., 1998; Peters et al., 2012) which is based on an approximate rejection sampling step within SMC to reject samples with low importance weights.

In this work, we leverage the idea of partial rejection control within the framework of SMC based VI for sequential latent variable models. To this end, we construct a novel lower bound VSMC-PRC and propose an efficient optimization strategy. As compared to other recently proposed SMC based VI approaches (Naesseth et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2017; Le et al., 2017), our approach consists of an inbuilt accept-reject mechanism within SMC to prevent particle depletion and obtain an unbiased marginal likelihood estimator. To the best of our knowledge, there are no unbiased estimators

available for SMC-PRC for arbitrary proposal distributions (but see Kudlicka et al., 2020, for when the proposal is the prior density itself).

Although the idea of combining VI with an inbuilt accept-reject mechanism is not new (Salimans et al., 2015; Ruiz & Titsias, 2019; Grover et al., 2018), a key distinction of our approach is to incorporate a partial accept-reject mechanism. In contrast to standard sampling algorithms that may reject the entire stream of particles, we use accept-reject on the most recent update, increasing the sampling efficiency. Another key distinction is that, while existing approaches using PRC (Liu et al., 1998; Peters et al., 2012) construct a biased marginal likelihood estimator, we leverage insights from dice-enterprise (Morina et al., 2019) and Bernoulli factory (Asmussen et al., 1992) to obtain an unbiased estimator.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide a brief review on SMC, partial rejection control, and dice enterprise. In Section 3, we introduce our VSMC-PRC bound and provide new theoretical insights into the Monte-Carlo estimator and design efficient ways to optimize it. Finally, we discuss related work and present experiments on the Gaussian state-space model (SSM) and variational recurrent neural networks (RNN).

# 2 BACKGROUND

We denote a sequence of  $T$  real-valued observations as  $x_{1:T} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T)$ , and assume that there is an associated sequence of latent variables  $z_{1:T} = (z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_T)$ . We further assume that the joint density  $p_\theta(x_{1:t}, z_{1:t})$  factorizes as follows for  $t \in \{2, 3, \ldots, T\}$

$$
p _ {\theta} \left(x _ {1: t}, z _ {1: t}\right) = p _ {\theta} \left(x _ {1: t - 1}, z _ {1: t - 1}\right) p _ {\theta} \left(x _ {t}, z _ {t} \mid x _ {1: t - 1}, z _ {1: t - 1}\right). \tag {1}
$$

We are interested in inferring the posterior distribution of the latent variables, i.e.,  $p(z_{1:T}|x_{1:T})$ . The task is, in general, intractable.

# 2.1 SEQUENTIAL MONTE CARLO WITH PARTIAL REJECTION CONTROL

A SMC sampler approximates a sequence of densities  $(p_{\theta}(z_{1:t}|x_{1:t}))_{t=1}^{T}$  through a set of  $N$  weighted samples generated from a proposal distribution. Let the proposal density be

$$
q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {1: T} \mid x _ {1: T}\right) = \prod_ {t = 1} ^ {T} q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {t} \mid x _ {1: t}, z _ {1: t - 1}\right). \tag {2}
$$

Consider time  $t - 1$  at which we have uniformly weighted samples  $\{N^{-1}, z_{1:t-1}^i, A_{t-1}^i\}_{i=1}^N$  estimating  $p_\theta(z_{1:t-1}|x_{1:t-1})$ . We want to estimate  $p_\theta(z_{1:t}|x_{1:t})$  such that particles with a low importance weight are automatically rejected. PRC achieves this by using an approximate rejection sampling step (Liu et al., 1998; Peters et al., 2012). The overall procedure is as follows:

- Generate  $z_{t}^{i} \sim q_{\phi}(z_{t}|x_{1:t},z_{1:t - 1}^{A_{t - 1}^{i}})$  where  $i = 1,2,\ldots ,N$ .  
- Accept  $z_{t}^{i}$  with probability

$$
a _ {\theta , \phi} \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} \mid z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1: t}\right) = \left(1 + \frac {M (i , t - 1) q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} \mid x _ {1 : t} , z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}\right)}{p _ {\theta} \left(x _ {t} , z _ {t} ^ {i} \mid x _ {1 : t - 1} , z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}\right)}\right) ^ {- 1}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $M(i, t - 1)$  is a hyperparameter controlling the acceptance rate. Note that PRC applies accept-reject only on  $z_t^i$ , not on the entire trajectory.

- The new incremental importance weight of the accepted sample is

$$
\alpha_ {t} \left(z _ {1: t} ^ {i}\right) = c _ {t} ^ {i} \int a _ {\theta , \phi} \left(z _ {t} \mid z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1: t}\right) q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {t} \mid x _ {1: t}, z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}\right) d z _ {t}, \tag {4}
$$

where  $c_{t}^{i}$  is

$$
c _ {t} ^ {i} = \frac {p _ {\theta} \left(x _ {t} , z _ {t} ^ {i} \mid x _ {1 : t - 1} , z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}\right)}{q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} \mid x _ {1 : t} , z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}\right) a _ {\theta , \phi} \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} \mid z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}} , x _ {1 : t}\right)}. \tag {5}
$$

- Compute Monte-Carlo estimator of  $\alpha_{t}(.)$ :

$$
\widetilde {w} _ {t} ^ {i} = \frac {p _ {\theta} \left(x _ {t} , z _ {t} ^ {i} \mid x _ {1 : t - 1} , z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}\right) \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} a _ {\theta , \phi} \left(\delta_ {t} ^ {i , k} \mid z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1 : t}\right)}{q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} \mid x _ {1 : t} , z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}\right) a _ {\theta , \phi} \left(z _ {t} ^ {i} \mid z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1 : t}\right)}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\delta_t^{i,k} \sim q_\phi(z_t|x_{1:t},z_{1:t-1}^{A_{t-1}^i})$  and  $k = 1,2,\ldots,K$ .

- Generate ancestor variables  $A_{t}^{i}$  through dice-enterprise and set new weights  $w_{t}^{i} = N^{-1}$  for  $i = 1,2,\dots,N$ :

$$
A _ {t} ^ {i} \sim \text {C a t e g o r i c a l} \left(\frac {\alpha_ {t} \left(z _ {1 : t} ^ {1}\right)}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {t} \left(z _ {1 : t} ^ {j}\right)}, \frac {\alpha_ {t} \left(z _ {1 : t} ^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {t} \left(z _ {1 : t} ^ {j}\right)}, \dots , \frac {\alpha_ {t} \left(z _ {1 : t} ^ {N}\right)}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {t} \left(z _ {1 : t} ^ {j}\right)}\right). \tag {7}
$$

# 2.2 DICE ENTERPRISE

Simulation of ancestor variables in Eq. (7) is non-trivial due to intractable normalization constants in the incremental importance weight (see Eq. (4)). Vanilla Monte-Carlo estimation yields biased estimators. To address this issue, we leverage a generalization of Bernoulli factory (Asmussen et al., 1992), called dice-enterprise (Morina et al., 2019).

Suppose we can simulate Bernoulli  $(p_t^i)$  outcomes where  $p_t^i$  is intractable. Bernoulli factory problem simulates an event with probability  $f(p_t^i)$ , where  $f(.)$  is some desired function. In our case, the intractable coin probability  $p_t^i$  is the intractable normalization constant,

$$
p _ {t} ^ {i} = \int a _ {\theta , \phi} \left(z _ {t} \mid z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1: t}\right) q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {t} \mid x _ {1: t}, z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}\right) d z _ {t}. \tag {8}
$$

Since  $p_t^i \in [0,1]$  and we can easily simulate this coin, we obtain the dice-enterprise algorithm below.

1. Required: Constants  $\{c_t^i\}_{i = 1}^N$  see (5).

2. Sample  $C \sim \text{Categorical}\left(\frac{c_t^1}{\sum_{j=1}^N c_t^j}, \frac{c_t^2}{\sum_{j=1}^N c_t^j}, \dots, \frac{c_t^N}{\sum_{j=1}^N c_t^j}\right)$

3. If  $C = i$ , generate  $U_{i} \sim U[0,1]$  and  $z_{t} \sim q_{\phi}(z_{t}|x_{1:t}, z_{1:t-1}^{A_{t-1}^{i}})$ .

- If  $U_{i} < a_{\theta, \phi}(z_{t}|z_{1:t - 1}^{A_{t - 1}^{i}}, x_{1:t})$  output  $i$  
- Else go to step 2

The dice-enterprise produces unbiased ancestor variables. For details on efficiency and correctness, please refer to Section 3.1. Our proposed VSMC-PRC bound is constructed through a marginal likelihood estimator obtained by combining the SMC sampler with a PRC step and dice-enterprise. The variance of estimators obtained through SMC-PRC particle filter is usually low (Kudlicka et al., 2020; Peters et al., 2012). Therefore, we expect VSMC-PRC to be a tighter bound compared to the standard SMC based bounds used in recent works (Maddison et al., 2017; Naesseth et al., 2017; Le et al., 2017). Algorithm (1) summarizes the generative process to simulate the VSMC-PRC bound.

# 3 PARTIAL REJECTION CONTROL BASED VI FORSEQUENTIAL LATENT VARIABLE MODELS

We now show how to leverage PRC to develop a robust VI framework for sequential latent variable models. Our framework is based on the VSMC-PRC bound presented below. The complete sampling distribution of Algorithm (1) is as follows.

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q _ {\mathrm {V S M C - P R C}} \left(z _ {1: T} ^ {1: N}, A _ {1: T - 1} ^ {1: N}, \delta_ {1: T} ^ {1: N, 1: K}\right) = \left(\prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N} q _ {\phi} \left(\delta_ {1} ^ {i, k} | x _ {1}\right) \prod_ {t = 2} ^ {T} \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} q _ {\phi} \left(\delta_ {t} ^ {i, k} | x _ {1: t}, z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}\right)\right) \times \\ \left(\prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \frac {q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {1} ^ {i} \mid x _ {1}\right) a _ {\theta , \phi} \left(z _ {1} ^ {i} \mid x _ {1}\right)}{Z \left(x _ {1} , M (i , 0)\right)} \prod_ {t = 1} ^ {T - 1} \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \operatorname {D i s c r e t e} \left(A _ {t} ^ {i} \mid \alpha_ {t}\right) \frac {q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {t + 1} ^ {i} \mid x _ {1 : t + 1} , z _ {1 : t} ^ {A _ {t} ^ {i}}\right) a _ {\theta , \phi} \left(z _ {t + 1} ^ {i} \mid z _ {1 : t} ^ {A _ {t} ^ {i}} , x _ {1 : t + 1}\right)}{Z \left(z _ {1 : t} ^ {A _ {t} ^ {i}} , x _ {1 : t + 1} , M (i , t)\right)}\right) \tag {9} \\ \end{array}
$$

The normalization constants  $Z(\cdot)$  in Eq. 9 are intractable and have to be estimated while calculating the weights. Therefore, we introduce an extra parameter  $K$ , denoting the number of Monte-Carlo samples used to estimate  $Z(\cdot)$ . The Monte-Carlo estimator of VSMC-PRC bound is

$$
\hat {\mathcal {L}} _ {\mathrm {V S M C - P R C}} (\theta , \phi ; x _ {1: T}, K) = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \log \left(\frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \tilde {w} _ {t} ^ {i}\right). \tag {10}
$$

We maximize the VSMC-PRC bound with respect to model parameters  $\theta$  and variational parameters  $\phi$ . This requires estimating the gradient the details of which are provided in Section (3.2).

# 3.1 THEORETICAL PROPERTIES

We now present properties of the Monte-Carlo estimator  $\hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\mathrm{VSMC - PRC}}$ . The key variables that affect this bound are  $N$  (number of samples), hyper-parameter  $M$ , and the number of Monte-Carlo samples used to compute the normalization constant  $Z(\cdot)$ , i.e.,  $K$ . As discussed by Bérard et al. (2014); Naesseth et al. (2017), as  $N$  increases, we expect the VSMC-PRC bound to get tighter. Hence, we will focus our attention on  $M$  and  $K$ . All the proofs can be found in the appendix.

Proposition 1. Dice-enterprise produces unbiased ancestor variables. Further, let  $\Lambda_t$  be the number of iterations required for generating one ancestor variable, then  $\Lambda_t \sim \text{Geom}(\mathbb{E}[\Lambda_t]^{-1})$  where

$$
\mathbb {E} [ \Lambda_ {t} ] = \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} c _ {t} ^ {i}}{\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} c _ {t} ^ {i} Z (z _ {1 : t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1 : t} , M (i , t - 1))}.
$$

As evident from Proposition (1), the computational efficiency of the dice-enterprise clearly relies on the normalization constant  $Z(\cdot)$ . Note that the value of  $Z(\cdot)$  could be interpreted as the average acceptance rate of PRC which depends on the hyper-parameter  $M(i, t - 1)$ . If the average acceptance rate for PRC for all particles is  $\gamma$ , then we can express the expected number of iterations as  $\mathbb{E}[\Lambda_t^i] = \gamma^{-1}$ . Therefore, the computational efficiency of dice-enterprise is similar to the PRC step and depends crucially on the hyper-parameter  $M$ .

Proposition 2. For all  $K$ ,  $\exp (\hat{\mathcal{L}}_{VSMC - PRC})$  is unbiased, i.e.,  $\mathbb{E}\left[\exp (\hat{\mathcal{L}}_{VSMC - PRC})\right] = p_{\theta}(x_{1:T})$ . Further,  $\mathbb{E}[\hat{\mathcal{L}}_{VSMC - PRC}]$  is non-decreasing in  $K$ .

The use of Monte-Carlo estimator in place of the true value of  $Z(\cdot)$  creates an inefficiency, as depicted by Proposition (2). The bound monotonically increases as we increase  $K$  despite the use of resampling operation. It is important to note that Algorithm (1) produces an unbiased estimator of the marginal likelihood for all values of  $K$ .

Proposition 3. Let the sampling distribution of the  $i^{th}$  particle (generated via PRC) at time  $t$  be  $r_{\theta, \phi}(z_t | z_{1:t-1}^{A_{t-1}^i}, x_{1:t})$ , then

$$
K L \left(r _ {\theta , \phi} (z _ {t} | z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1: t}) \| p _ {\theta} (z _ {t} | z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1: t})\right) \leq K L \left(q _ {\phi} (z _ {t} | z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1: t}) \| p _ {\theta} (z _ {t} | z _ {1: t - 1} ^ {A _ {t - 1} ^ {i}}, x _ {1: t})\right).
$$

Proposition (3) implies that the use of the accept-reject mechanism within SMC refines the sampling distribution. Instead of accepting all samples, the PRC step ensures that only high-quality samples are accepted, leading to a tighter bound for VSMC in general (not always). We show in the appendix that when  $M(i,t - 1)\to \infty$ , the PRC step reduces to pure rejection sampling (Robert & Casella, 2013). On the other hand,  $M(i,t - 1)\rightarrow 0$  implies that all samples are accepted from the proposal. Recall,  $M(i,t - 1)$  is a hyperparameter that can be tuned to control the acceptance rate. For more details on tuning  $M$ , see Section (3.3).

# 3.2 GRADIENT ESTIMATION

For tuning the variational parameters, we use stochastic optimization. Algorithm (1) produces the marginal likelihood estimator by sequentially sampling the particles, ancestor variables, and particles for the normalization constant  $(z_{1:T}^{1:N}, A_{1:T-1}^{1:N}, \delta_{1:T}^{1:N,1:K})$ .

When the variational distribution  $q_{\phi}(.)$  is reparameterizable, we can make the sampling of  $\delta_t^{i,k}$  independent of the model and variational parameters. However, the generated particles  $z_t^i$  are not reparametrizable due to the PRC step. Finally, the ancestor variables are discrete and, therefore, cannot be reparameterized. The complete gradient can be divided into three core components (assuming  $q_{\phi}(.)$  is reparametrizable):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \nabla_ {\theta , \phi} \mathbb {E} [ \hat {\mathcal {L}} _ {\mathrm {V S M C - P R C}} ] = \mathbb {E} _ {Q _ {\mathrm {V S M C - P R C}}} \left[ \nabla_ {\theta , \phi} \hat {\mathcal {L}} _ {\mathrm {V S M C - P R C}} (\theta , \phi ; x _ {1: T}, K) \right] + g _ {\mathrm {P R C}} + g _ {\mathrm {R S A M P}} (11) \\ \approx \mathbb {E} _ {Q _ {\mathrm {V S M C - P R C}}} \left[ \nabla_ {\theta , \phi} \hat {\mathcal {L}} _ {\mathrm {V S M C - P R C}} (\theta , \phi ; x _ {1: T}, K) \right]. (12) \\ \end{array}
$$

Note that  $g_{\mathrm{PRC}}$  and  $g_{\mathrm{RSAMP}}$  denote the score gradient of PRC and resampling step, respectively. Due to high variance, we have ignored these terms for the optimization. We have derived the full gradient and explored the gradient variance issues in the appendix. Please see Figure (2) (left) comparing the convergence of biased gradient vs. unbiased gradients on a toy Gaussian SSM.

# 3.3 LEARNING THE  $M$  MATRIX

We use  $M$  as a hyperparameter for the PRC step which controls the acceptance rate of the sampler. The basic scheme of tuning  $M$  is as follows:

- Define a new random variable  $F(z_{t+1} | z_{1:t}^{A_t^i}, x_{1:t+1}) = \log \left( \frac{q_\phi(z_{t+1} | x_{1:t+1}, z_{1:t}^{A_t^i})}{p_\theta(x_{t+1}, z_{t+1} | x_{1:t}, z_{1:t}^{A_t^i})} \right)$ .

- Draw  $z_{t+1}^{j} \sim q_{\phi}(z_{t+1}|x_{1:t+1}, z_{1:t}^{A_{t}^{i}})$  for  $j = 1, 2, \ldots, J$ .  
- Evaluate  $\gamma \in [0,1]$  quantile value of  $\{F(z_{t+1}^j | z_t^{A_t^i}, x_{1:t+1})\}_{j=1}^J$ . In general for this case the acceptance rate would be around  $\gamma$  for all particles.

$$
\log M (i, t) = - \mathcal {Q} _ {F \left(z _ {t + 1} \mid z _ {1: t} ^ {A _ {t} ^ {i}}, x _ {1: t + 1}\right)} (\gamma). \tag {13}
$$

- If  $M$  matrix is very large then use a common  $\{M(:,t)\}_{t = 1}^{T}$  for every time-step. In general, for this configuration, the acceptance rate would be greater than equal to  $\gamma$  for all particles:

$$
\log M (., t) = \min  \left\{- \mathcal {Q} _ {F \left(z _ {t + 1} \mid z _ {1: t} ^ {A _ {t} ^ {i}}, x _ {1: t + 1}\right)} (\gamma) \right\} _ {i = 1} ^ {N}. \tag {14}
$$

Through  $\gamma$ , we can directly control the acceptance rate. For example, if  $\gamma = 0.5$  then the acceptance rate would be around (greater than)  $50\%$  for (Eq. 13) (see Eq. (14)). Note that a similar scheme was employed in Grover et al. (2018). We update  $\{\{M(i,t - 1)\}_{i = 1}^{N}\}_{t = 1}^{T}$  dynamically once every  $F$  epochs to save time. To learn more on setting hyper-parameter  $M$ , see Liu et al. (1998); Peters et al. (2012).

# 4 RELATED WORK AND SPECIAL CASES

There is significant recent interest in developing more expressive variational posteriors for latent variable models. There are two basic schemes for constructing tighter bounds on the log marginal likelihood: sampling-based methods (MCMC, rejection sampling) (Salimans et al., 2015; Ruiz & Titsias, 2019; Hoffman, 2017; Grover et al., 2018) or multiple samples from VI distributions to increase the flexibility (IS, SMC) (Burda et al., 2015; Maddison et al., 2017; Lawson et al., 2018; Naesseth et al., 2015). In this work, we present a unified framework for combining these two approaches, utilizing the best of both worlds. Although applying sampling-based methods on VI is useful, the density ratio between the true posterior and the improved density is often intractable. Therefore, we cannot take advantage of variance-reducing schemes like resampling, which is crucial for sequential models. We solve this issue through dice-enterprise: an extension of the Bernoulli factory.

Recently, Bernoulli factory has amassed a great interest in the area of Bayesian inference (Gonçalves et al., 2017a;b; Vats et al., 2020). Although Bernoulli factory is theoretically valuable, its applicability is severely limited due to a high rejection rate. In this paper, we have presented an approach that combines SMC with dice-enterprise in a practically meaningful manner. A closely related work is Schmon et al. (2019), which also uses Bernoulli factory to implement unbiased resampling. However, the work is mostly focused on partially observed diffusions and likely limited to low-dimensional models (unlike our approach). Another closely related work is Kudlicka et al. (2020), which also produces an unbiased estimator for SMC-PRC; however, the approach is only applicable when the proposal is the prior distribution itself.

To provide more clarity, we will consider some special cases of VSMC-PRC bound and relate it with existing work: For the special case of  $N = 1$  and  $T = 1$ , our method reduces to variational rejection sampling (VRS) (Grover et al., 2018). For  $N, T > 1$ , if we remove the PRC step, our bound reduces to FIVO (Maddison et al., 2017). Finally, if we remove both the PRC step and resampling, then our method effectively reduces to IWAE (Burda et al., 2015). Please refer to Figure (1) for more details.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we evaluate our proposed algorithm on synthetic as well as real-world datasets and compare them with relevant baselines. For the synthetic data experiment, we implement our method on a Gaussian SSM and compare our approach with VSMC (Naesseth et al., 2017). For the real data experiment, we train a VRNN (Chung et al., 2015) on the polyphonic music dataset.

$$
z _ {t} = A z _ {t - 1} + e _ {z},
$$

$$
x _ {t} = C z _ {t} + e _ {x},
$$

where  $e_z, e_x \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$  and  $z_0 = 0$ . We are interested in learning a good proposal for the above model. The latent variable is denoted by  $z_t$  and the observed data by  $x_t$ . Let the dimension of  $z_t$  be  $d_z$  and dimension of  $x_t$  be  $d_x$ . The matrix  $A$  has the elements  $(A)_{i,j} = \alpha^{|i - j| + 1}$ , for  $\alpha = 0.42$ . We explore different settings of  $d_z, d_x$ , and matrix  $C$ . A sparse version of  $C$  matrix measures the first  $d_x$  components of  $z_t$ , on the other hand a dense version of  $C$  is normally distributed i.e.  $C_{i,j} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ . We consider four different configurations for the experiment. For more details please refer to Figure (2).

The variational distribution is a multivariate Gaussian with unknown mean vector  $\mu = \{\mu_d\}_{d=1}^{d_z}$  and diagonal covariance matrix  $\{\log \sigma_d^2\}_{d=1}^{d_z}$ . We set  $N = 4$  and  $T = 10$  for all the cases:

$$
q \left(z _ {t} \mid z _ {t - 1}\right) \sim \mathcal {N} \left(z _ {t} \mid A z _ {t - 1} + \mu , \operatorname {d i a g} \left(\sigma^ {2}\right)\right).
$$

The  $\{\{M(i,t - 1)\}_{i = 1}^{N}\}_{t = 1}^{T}$  matrix (see (13)) for approximate rejection sampling is updated once every 10 epochs with acceptance rate  $\gamma \in \{0.8,0.4\}$ . For estimating the intractable normalization constants, we generate  $K = 3$  samples. Figure (2): (left) compares the convergence of biased gradient vs unbiased gradients. Note that we get a much tighter bound as compared to VSMC (Naesseth et al., 2017).

# 5.2 VARIATIONAL RNN

VRNN (Chung et al., 2015) comprises of three core components: the observation  $x_{t}$ , stochastic latent state  $z_{t}$ , and a deterministic hidden state  $h_{t}(z_{t-1}, x_{t-1}, h_{t-1})$ , which is modeled through a RNN. For the experiments, we use a single-layer LSTM for modeling the hidden state. The conditional distributions  $p_{t}(z_{t}|.)$  and  $q_{t}(z_{t}|.)$  are assumed to be factorized Gaussians, parametrized by a single layer neural net. The output distribution  $g_{t}(x_{t}|.)$  depends on the dataset. For a fair comparison, we use the same model setting as employed in FIVO (Maddison et al., 2017). We evaluate our model on four polyphonic music datasets: Nottingham, JSB chorales, Musedata, and Piano-midi.de.

Each observation  $x_{t}$  is represented as a binary vector of 88 dimensions. Therefore, we model the observation distribution  $g_{t}(x_{t}|.)$  by a set of 88 factorized Bernoulli variables. We split all four datasets into the standard train, validation, and test sets. For tuning the learning rate, we use the validation

test set. For a fair comparison, we use the same learning rate and iterations for all the models. Let the dimension of hidden state (learned by single layer LSTM) be  $d_h$  and dimension of latent variable be  $d_z$ . We choose the setting  $d_z = d_h = 64$  for all the data-sets except JSB. For modeling JSB, we use  $d_z = d_h = 32$ . For VSMC-PRC we have considered  $N \in \{4,6\}$ . Further, for each  $N$ , we consider four settings  $(K,\gamma) \in \{(1,0.9),(1,0.8),(3,0.9),(3,0.8)\}$ . The  $M$  hyper-parameter for PRC step is learned from (14) due to large size. We have updated  $M$  value once every 50 epochs. Note that in this scenario, the acceptance rate for all particles would be greater than equal to  $\gamma$ . For more details on experiments, please refer to the appendix.

As discussed in Section (3.1), the PRC step and dice-enterprise have time complexity  $\mathcal{O}(N / \gamma)$  for producing  $N$  samples (assuming average acceptance rate  $\gamma$ ). Therefore, we consider  $[N\gamma^{-1}]$  particles for IWAE and FIVO to ensure effectively the same number of particles, where  $N \in \{4,6\}$  and  $\gamma = 0.8$ . Note, however, that the acceptance rate is  $\geq \gamma$ , so this adjustment actually favors the other approaches more. For FIVO, we perform resampling when ESS falls below  $N / 2$ . Table (1) summarizes the results which show whether rejecting samples provide us with any benefit or not, and as the results show, our approach, even with the aforementioned adjustment, outperforms the other approaches in terms of test log-likelihoods, while still having a similar computational cost.

Table 1: We report Test log-likelihood for models trained with FIVO, IWAE, ELBO, and VSMC-PRC. For VSMC-PRC  $N = (4,6)$  and  $(K,\gamma) \in \{(1,0.9),(1,0.8),(3,0.9),(3,0.8)\}$  (results are in this order). The results for pianoroll data-sets are in nats per timestep.

In Sec. (3.1), we discussed the effect of  $K$  and PRC rejection rate on VSMC-PRC bound. We expect a performance improvement when  $K$  and the rejection rate is increased. Although the results for VSMC-PRC's different configurations are almost the same, we still get the best average ranking for  $(K = 3, \gamma = 0.8)$ . Overall, for most cases, VSMC-PRC bound performs better than FIVO (Maddison et al., 2017) and IWAE (Burda et al., 2015) for a variety of configurations.

In VSMC-PRC, improvement in the bound value comes at the cost of estimating the normalization constant  $Z(\cdot)$ , i.e.,  $K$ . Therefore, the proposed bound uses more particles (PRC step and dice-enterprise) than existing approaches like FIFO and IWAE due to intractability. Table (1) signifies that rejecting samples with low importance weight is better instead of keeping a large number of particles (at least for a reasonably high acceptance rate  $\gamma$ ). Future work aims at designing a scalable implementation for VSMC-PRC bound that consumes fewer particles.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We introduced VSMC-PRC, a novel bound that combines SMC and partial rejection sampling with VI in a synergistic manner. This results in a robust VI procedure for sequential latent variable models. Instead of using standard sampling algorithms, we have employed a partial sampling scheme suitable for high dimensional sequences. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate that VSMC-PRC outperforms existing bounds like IWAE (Burda et al., 2015) and standard particle filter bounds (Maddison et al., 2017; Naesseth et al., 2017; Le et al., 2017). The future work aims at designing a parallel implementation of dice-enterprise (Schmon et al., 2019) for faster resampling and to explore partial versions of powerful sampling algorithms like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Neal et al., 2011) instead of rejection sampling.
