# ABSTRACT

Recent work on deep learning for tabular data demonstrates the strong performance of deep tabular models, often bridging the gap between gradient boosted decision trees and neural networks. Accuracy aside, a major advantage of neural models is that they are easily fine-tuned in new domains and learn reusable features. This property is often exploited in computer vision and natural language applications, where transfer learning is indispensable when task-specific training data is scarce. In this work, we explore the benefits that representation learning provides for knowledge transfer in the tabular domain. We conduct experiments in a realistic medical diagnosis test bed with limited amounts of downstream data and find that transfer learning with deep tabular models provides a definitive advantage over gradient boosted decision tree methods. We further compare the supervised and self-supervised pretraining strategies and provide practical advice on transfer learning with tabular models. Finally, we propose a pseudo-feature method for cases where the upstream and downstream feature sets differ, a tabular-specific problem widespread in real-world applications.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Tabular data is ubiquitous throughout diverse real-world applications, spanning medical diagnosis (Johnson et al., 2016), housing price prediction (Afonso et al., 2019), loan approval (Arun et al., 2016), and robotics (Wienke et al., 2018), yet practitioners still rely heavily on classical machine learning systems. Recently, neural network architectures and training routines for tabular data have advanced significantly. Leading methods in tabular deep learning (Gorishniy et al., 2021; 2022; Somepalli et al., 2021; Kossen et al., 2021) now perform on par with the traditionally dominant gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) (Friedman, 2001; Prokhorenkova et al., 2018; Chen and Guestrin, 2016; Ke et al., 2017). On top of their competitive performance, neural networks, which are end-to-end differentiable and extract complex data representations, possess numerous capabilities which decision trees lack; one especially useful capability is transfer learning, in which a representation learned on pre-training data is reused or fine-tuned on one or more downstream tasks.

Transfer learning plays a central role in industrial computer vision and natural language processing pipelines, where models learn generic features that are useful across many tasks. For example, feature extractors pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset can enhance object detectors (Ren et al., 2015), and large transformer models trained on vast text corpora develop conceptual understandings which can be readily fine-tuned for question answering or language inference (Devlin et al., 2019). One might wonder if deep neural networks for tabular data, which are typically shallow and whose hierarchical feature extraction is unexplored, can also build representations that are transferable beyond their pre-training tasks. In fact, a recent survey paper on deep learning with tabular data suggested that efficient knowledge transfer in tabular data is an open research question (Borisov et al., 2021). In this work, we show that deep tabular models with transfer learning definitively outperform their classical counterparts when auxiliary upstream pre-training data is available and the amount of downstream data is limited. Importantly, we find representation learning with tabular neural networks to be more powerful than gradient boosted decision trees with stacking – a strong baseline leveraging knowledge transfer from the upstream data with classical methods.

Some of the most common real-world scenarios with limited data are medical applications. Accumulating large amounts of patient data with labels is often very difficult, especially for rare conditions or hospital-specific tasks. However, large related datasets, e.g. for more common diagnoses, may be available in such cases. We note that while computer vision medical applications are common

(Irvin et al., 2019; Santa Cruz et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2018b; Turbe et al., 2021), many medical datasets are fundamentally tabular (Goldberger et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2021; 2016; Law and Liu, 2009). Motivated by this scenario, we choose a realistic medical diagnosis test bed for our experiments both for its practical value and transfer learning suitability. We first design a suite of benchmark transfer learning tasks using the MetaMIMIC repository (Grzyb et al., 2021; Woźnica et al., 2022) and use this collection of tasks to compare transfer learning with prominent tabular models and GBDT methods at different levels of downstream data availability. We explore several transfer learning setups and lend suggestions to practitioners who may adopt tabular transfer learning. Additionally, we compare supervised pre-training and self-supervised pre-training strategies and find that supervised pre-training leads to more transferable features in the tabular domain, contrary to findings in vision where a mature progression of self-supervised methods exhibit strong performance (He et al., 2020).

Finally, we propose a pseudo-feature method which enables transfer learning when upstream and downstream feature sets differ. As tabular data is highly heterogeneous, the problem of downstream tasks whose formats and features differ from those of upstream data is common and has been reported to complicate knowledge transfer (Lewinson, 2020). Nonetheless, if our upstream data is missing columns present in downstream data, we still want to leverage pre-training. Our approach uses transfer learning in stages. In the case that upstream data is missing a column, we first pre-train a model on the upstream data without that feature. We then fine-tune the pre-trained model on downstream data to predict values in the column absent from the upstream data. Finally, after assigning pseudo-values of this feature to the upstream samples, we re-do the pre-training and transfer the feature extractor to the downstream task. This approach offers appreciable performance boosts over discarding the missing features and often performs comparably to models pre-trained with the ground truth feature values.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

1. We find that recent deep tabular models combined with transfer learning have a decisive advantage over strong GBDT baselines, even those that also leverage upstream data.  
2. We compare supervised and self-supervised pre-training strategies and find that the supervised pre-training leads to more transferable features in the tabular domain.  
3. We propose a pseudo-feature method for aligning the upstream and downstream feature sets in heterogeneous data, addressing a common obstacle in the tabular domain.  
4. We provide advice for practitioners on architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and transfer learning setups for tabular transfer learning.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Deep learning for tabular data. The field of machine learning for tabular data has traditionally been dominated by gradient-boosted decision trees (Friedman, 2001; Chen and Guestrin, 2016; Ke et al., 2017; Prokhorenkova et al., 2018). These models are used for practical applications across domains ranging from finance to medicine and are consistently recommended as the approach of choice for modeling tabular data (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022).

An extensive line of work on tabular deep learning aims to challenge the dominance of GBDT models. Numerous tabular neural architectures have been introduced, based on the ideas of creating differentiable learner ensembles (Popov et al., 2019; Hazimeh et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2018; Kontschieder et al., 2015; Badirli et al., 2020), incorporating attention mechanisms and transformer architectures (Somepalli et al., 2021; Gorishniy et al., 2021; Arik and Pfister, 2021; Huang et al., 2020; Song et al., 2019; Kossen et al., 2021), as well as a variety of other approaches (Wang et al., 2017; 2021; Beutel et al., 2018; Klambauer et al., 2017; Fiedler, 2021; Schäfl et al., 2021). However, recent systematic benchmarking of deep tabular models (Gorishniy et al., 2021; Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022) shows that while these models are competitive with GBDT on some tasks, there is still no universal best method. Gorishniy et al. (2021) show that transformer-based models are the strongest alternative to GBDT and that ResNet and MLP models coupled with a strong hyperparameter tuning routine (Akiba et al., 2019) offer competitive baselines. Similarly, Kadra et al. (2021) find that carefully regularized MLPs are competitive. In a follow-up work, Gorishniy et al. (2022) show that

transformer architectures equipped with advanced embedding schemes for numerical features bridge the performance gap between deep tabular models and GBDT.

Transfer learning. Transfer learning (Pan and Yang, 2010; Weiss et al., 2016; Zhuang et al., 2020) has been incredibly successful in domains of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Large fine-tuned models excel on a variety of image classification (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2021) and NLP benchmarks (Devlin et al., 2019; Howard and Ruder, 2018). ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) pre-trained feature extractors are incorporated into the complex pipelines of successful object detection and semantic segmentation models (Chen et al., 2018a; Ren et al., 2015; Redmon and Farhadi, 2018; Redmon et al., 2016). Transfer learning is also particularly helpful in applications with limited data availability such as medical image classification (Alzubaidi et al., 2021; Heker and Greenspan, 2020; Chen et al., 2019; Alzubaidi et al., 2020).

In the tabular data domain, a recent review paper (Borisov et al., 2021) finds that transfer learning is underexplored and that the question of how to perform knowledge transfer and leverage upstream data remains open. In our work, we seek to answer these questions through a systematic study of transfer learning with recent successful deep tabular models.

Multiple works mention that transfer learning in the tabular domain is challenging due to the highly heterogeneous nature of tabular data (Jain et al., 2021; Lewinson, 2020). Several papers focus on converting tabular data to images instead (Sharma et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2019) and leveraging transfer learning with vision models (Sun et al., 2019). Other studies explore designing CNN-like inductive biases for tabular models (Joffe, 2021), transferring XGBoost hyperparameters (Woznica et al., 2022; Grzyb et al., 2021), and transferring whole models (Fang et al., 2019; Al-Stouhi and Reddy, 2011; Li et al., 2021) in the limited setting of shared label and feature space between the upstream and downstream tasks. Additionally, a concurrent work by Wang and Sun (2022) proposes a variable-column tabular neural network and applies it to transfer knowledge between datasets with partially-overlapping columns and same label space.

Stacking could also be seen as a form of leveraging upstream knowledge in classical methods (Wolpert, 1992; Ting and Witten, 1997).

Self-supervised learning. Self-supervised learning (SSL) aimed at harnessing unlabelled data through learning its structure and invariances has accumulated a large body of works over the last few years. Prominent SSL methods, such as Masked Language Modeling (MLM) (Devlin et al., 2019) in NLP and contrastive pre-training in computer vision (Chen et al., 2020) have revolutionized their fields making SSL the pre-training approach of choice (Devlin et al., 2019; Lan et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2020; Bardes et al., 2021; Misra and Maaten, 2020). In fact, SSL pre-training in vision has been shown to produce more transferable features than supervised pre-training on ImageNet (He et al., 2020).

Recently, SSL has been adopted in the tabular domain for semi-supervised learning (Yin et al., 2020; Yoon et al., 2020; Ucar et al., 2021; Somepalli et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2020). Contrastive pre-training on auxiliary unlabelled data (Somepalli et al., 2021) and MLM-like approaches (Huang et al., 2020) have been shown to provide gains over training from scratch for transformer tabular architectures in cases of limited labelled data. Finally, Rubachev et al. (2022) investigate benefits of supervised and unsupervised pretraining when applied to the same data without transferring knowledge between tasks.

# 3 TRANSFER LEARNING SETUP IN TABULAR DOMAIN

To study transfer learning in the tabular domain, we need to choose benchmark tasks and training pipelines. In this section, we detail both our upstream-downstream datasets as well as the tools we use to optimize transfer learning for tabular data.

# 3.1 METAMIMIC TEST BED FOR TRANSFER LEARNING EXPERIMENTS

MetaMIMIC repository. As medical diagnosis data often contains similar test results (i.e. features) across patients, and some diseases (i.e. tasks) are common while others are rare, this setting is a realistic use-case for our work. We thus construct a suite of transfer learning benchmarks using the MetaMIMIC repository Grzyb et al. (2021); Woznica et al. (2022) which is based on the MIMIC-IV

![](images/8ffe4838646761f10ba3f9e80f245dbb1ab6b4da371293e052aefe8c4072fc6f.jpg)  
Figure 1: Tabular transfer learning pipeline with MetaMIMIC. We pre-train deep tabular neural networks on abundant upstream patient data with 11 diagnosis targets via multi-label classification. Then, we fine-tune the pre-trained models on limited downstream data with similar features to predict the new target diagnosis.

Johnson et al. (2021); Goldberger et al. (2000) clinical database of anonymized patient data from the the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ICU admissions. MetaMIMIC contains 12 binary prediction tasks corresponding to different diagnoses such as hypertensive diseases, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, alcohol dependence and others. It covers 34925 patients and 172 features, including one categorical feature (gender), related to the medical examination of patients hand-selected by the authors to have the smallest number of missing values (Grzyb et al., 2021; Woznica et al., 2022). The features include mean, maximum and minimum statistics of lab test results as well as general features such as height, weight, age and gender. The 12 medical diagnosis targets are related tasks of varied similarity and make MetaMIMIC a perfect test bed for transfer learning experiments.

Upstream and downstream tasks. A medical practitioner may possess abundant annotated diagnosis data corresponding to a number of common diseases and want to harness this data to assist in diagnosing another disease, perhaps one which is rare or for which data is scarce. To simulate this scenario, we create transfer learning problems by splitting the MetaMIMIC data into upstream and downstream tasks. Specifically, we reserve 11 targets for the upstream pre-training tasks and one target for the downstream fine-tuning tasks, thus obtaining 12 upstream-downstream splits – one for each downstream diagnosis. Additionally, we limit the amount of downstream data to 4, 10, 20, 100, and 200 samples corresponding to several scenarios of data availability.

In total, we have 60 combinations of upstream and downstream datasets for our transfer learning experiments. We pre-train our models as multi-label classifiers on the upstream datasets with 11 targets and then transfer the feature extractors onto the downstream binary diagnosis tasks, Figure 1 presents a diagram illustrating the pipeline.

# 3.2 TABULAR MODELS

We conduct transfer learning experiments with four tabular neural networks, and we compare them to two GBDT implementations.

For neural networks, we use transformer-based architectures found to be the most competitive with GBDT tabular approaches (Gorishniy et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2020; Gorishniy et al., 2022). The specific implementations we consider include the recent FT-Transformer (Gorishniy et al., 2021) and TabTransformer (Huang et al., 2020). We do not include implementations with inter-sample attention (Somepalli et al., 2021; Kossen et al., 2021) in our experiments since these do not lend themselves to scenarios with extremely limited downstream data. In addition, we use MLP and ResNet tabular architectures as they are known to be consistent and competitive baselines (Gorishniy et al., 2021).

The TabTransformer architecture comprises of an embedding layer for categorical features, a stack of transformer layers and a multi-layer perceptron applied to concatenation of processed categorical

features and normalized numerical features. In contrast, FT-Transformer architecture transforms all features (including numerical) to embeddings and applies a stack of Transformer layers to the embeddings.

For GBDT implementation, we use the popular Catboost (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018) and XGBoost libraries (Chen and Guestrin, 2016).

# 3.3 TRANSFER LEARNING SETUPS AND BASELINES

In addition to a range of architectures, we consider several setups for transferring the upstream pre-trained neural feature extractors onto downstream tasks. Specifically, we use either a single linear layer or a two-layer MLP with 200 neurons in each layer for the classification head. We also either freeze the weights of the feature extractor or fine-tune the entire model end-to-end. To summarize, we implement four transfer learning setups for neural networks:

- Linear head atop a frozen feature extractor  
MLP head atop a frozen feature extractor  
- End-to-end fine-tuned feature extractor with a linear head  
- End-to-end fine-tuned feature extractor with an MLP head

We compare the above setups to the following baselines:

- Neural models trained from scratch on downstream data  
- CatBoost and XGBoost with and without stacking

We use stacking for GBDT models to build a stronger baseline which leverages the upstream data (Wolpert, 1992; Ting and Witten, 1997). To implement stacking, we first train upstream GBDT models to predict the 11 upstream targets and then concatenate their predictions to the downstream data features when training downstream GBDT models.

# 3.4 HYPERPARAMETER TUNING

The standard hyperparameter tuning procedure for deep learning is to randomly sample a validation set and use it to optimize the hyperparameters. In contrast, in our scenario we often have too little downstream data to afford a sizeable validation split. However, we can make use of the abundant upstream data and leverage hyperparameter transfer which is known to be effective for GBDT (Woźnica et al., 2022; Grzyb et al., 2021).

We tune the hyperparameters of each model with the Optuna library (Akiba et al., 2019) using Bayesian optimization. In particular, for GBDT models and neural baselines trained from scratch, we tune the hyperparameters on a single randomly chosen upstream target with the same number of training samples as available in the downstream task, since hyperparameters depend strongly on the sample size. The optimal hyperparameters are chosen based on the upstream validation set, where validation data is plentiful. We find this tuning strategy to be especially effective for GBDT and provide comparison with default hyperparameters in Appendix C. The benefits of this hyperparameter tuning approach are less pronounced for deep baselines.

For deep models with transfer learning, we tune the hyperparameters on the full upstream data using the available large upstream validation set with the goal to obtain the best performing feature extractor for the pre-training multi-target task. We then fine-tune this feature extractor with a small learning rate on the downstream data. As this strategy offers considerable performance gains over default hyperparameters, we highlight the importance of tuning the feature extractor and present the comparison with default hyperparameters in Appendix C as well as the details on hyperparameter search spaces for each model.

# 4 RESULTS FOR TRANSFER LEARNING WITH DEEP TABULAR MODELS

In this section, we compare transfer learned deep tabular models with GBDT methods at varying levels of downstream data availability. We note that here we present the aggregated results in the

Figure 2: Average model ranks across all downstream tasks. Deep tabular models and GBDT performance is presented on the corresponding panels. Within each panel, columns represent transfer learning setups, and rows correspond to the number of available downstream samples. Warmer colors indicate better performance. FS denotes training from scratch (without pre-training on upstream data), LH and MLP denote linear and MLP heads correspondingly, E2E denotes end-to-end training. Rank is averaged across all downstream tasks. FT-Transformer fine-tuned end-to-end outperforms all GBDT models, including GBDT with stacking, at all data levels. MLP is highly competitive in low data regimes.

form of the average rank of the models across all of the twelve downstream tasks at each data level. We choose this rank aggregation metric since it does not allow a small number of high-variance tasks to dominate comparisons, unlike, for example, average accuracy. Ranks are computed taking into account statistical significance of the performance differences between the models. We further report the detailed results for all of the models on all datasets and results for TabTransformer in Appendix D.

Figure 2 presents average model ranks on the downstream tasks as a heatmap where the warmer colors represent better overall rank. The performance of every model is shown on the dedicated panel of the heatmap with the results for different transfer learning setups presented in columns. First, noting the color pattern in the Catboost and XGBoost columns, we observe that deep tabular models pre-trained on the upstream data outperform GBDT at all data levels and especially in the low data regime of 4-20 downstream samples.

We emphasize that knowledge transfer with stacking, while providing strong boosts compared to from-scratch GBDT training (see Stacking and FS columns of GBDT), still decisively falls behind the deep tabular models with transfer learning, suggesting that representation learning for tabular data is significantly more powerful and allows neural networks to transfer richer information than simple predictions learned on the upstream tasks.

We summarize the main practical takeaways of Figure 2 below:

- Simpler models such as MLP with transfer learning are competitive, especially in extremely low data regimes. More complex architectures like FT-Transformer offer consistent performance gains over GBDT across all data levels and reach their peak performance in higher data regimes.  
- Representation learning with deep tabular models provides significant gains over strong GBDT baselines leveraging knowledge transfer from the upstream data through stacking. The gains are especially pronounced in low data regimes.  
- Regarding transfer learning setups, we find that using an MLP head with a trainable or frozen feature extractor is effective for all deep tabular models. Additionally, a linear head with an end-to-end fine-tuned feature extractor is competitive for FT-Transformer.

To verify that transfer learning with deep tabular models works well beyond the medical domain, we conduct experiments on other datasets: Yeast functional genomics data from the biological sciences domain (Elisseeff and Weston, 2001) and Emotions data from the music domain (Trohidis et al., 2008). Both datasets are multilabel, and we treat each classification label as a separate task. Similarly to the experiments with MetaMIMIC, we split the tasks into downstream and upstream by reserving

Within each panel, columns represent pre-training strategies and rows correspond to the number of available downstream samples. Warmer colors indicate better performance. Contrastive pre-training outperforms from-scratch trained models, while MLM pre-training is not effective. Supervised pre-training outperforms all self-supervised pre-training strategies in our experiments.

![](images/23b3da9acb3dbca975c79df4a89490104f15078d53b92d376aae84d354705d9a.jpg)

$n - 1$  labels for the upstream task and the  $n$ -th label for the downstream task. We report results of these experiments in Figures 8, 9 in Appendix D.5. We observe similar trends and in particular that deep tabular models pre-trained on upstream data and finetuned with MLP head outperform deep baselines trained from scratch and Catboost models leveraging stacking.

# 5 SELF-SUPERVISED PRE-TRAINING

In domains where established SSL methods are increasingly dominant, such as computer vision, self-supervised learners are known to extract more transferable features than models trained on labelled data (He et al., 2020; 2021). In this section, we compare supervised pre-training with unsupervised pre-training and find that the opposite is true in the tabular domain. We use the Masked Language Model (MLM) pre-training recently adapted to tabular data (Huang et al., 2020) and the tabular version of contrastive learning (Somepalli et al., 2021). Since both methods were proposed for tabular transformer architectures, we conduct the experiments with the FT-Transformer model. The inferior performance of self-supervised pre-training might be a consequence of the fact that SSL is significantly less explored and tuned in the tabular domain than in vision or NLP.

# 5.1 TABULAR MLM PRETRAINING

Masked Language Modeling (MLM) was first proposed for language models by Devlin et al. (2019) as a powerful unsupervised learning strategy. MLM involves training a model to predict tokens in text masked at random so that its learned representations contain information useful for reconstructing these masked tokens. In the tabular domain, instead of masking tokens, a random subset of features is masked for each sample, and the masked values are predicted in a multi-target classification manner (Huang et al., 2020). In our experiments, we mask one randomly selected feature for each sample, asking the network to learn the structure of the data and form representations from  $n - 1$  features that are useful in producing the value in the  $n$ -th feature. For more detail, see Appendix B.

# 5.2 CONTRASTIVE PRE-TRAINING

Contrastive pre-training uses data augmentations to generate positive pairs, or two different augmented views of a given example, and the loss function encourages a feature extractor to map positive pairs to similar features. Meanwhile, the network is also trained to map negative pairs, or augmented views of different base examples, far apart in feature space. We utilize the implementation of contrastive learning from Somepalli et al. (2021). In particular, we generate positive pairs by applying two data augmentations: CutMix (Yun et al., 2019) in the input space and Mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) in the embedding space. For more details, see Appendix B.

# 5.3 COMPARING SUPERVISED AND SELF-SUPERVISED PRE-TRAINING

While self-supervised learning makes for transferable feature extractors in other domains, our experiments show that supervised pre-training is consistently better than the recent SSL pre-training methods we try that are designed for tabular data. In Figure 3, we compare supervised pre-training with contrastive and MLM pre-training strategies and show that supervised pre-training always attains the best average rank. Contrastive pre-training produces better results than training from scratch on the downstream data when using a linear head, but it is still inferior to supervised pre-training. Tabular MLM pretraining also falls behind the supervised strategy and performs comparably to training from scratch in the lower data regimes but leads to a weaker downstream model in the higher data regimes.

# 6 ALIGNING UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM FEATURE SETS WITH PSEUDO-FEATURES

While so far we have worked with upstream and downstream tasks which shared a common feature space, in the real world, tabular data is highly heterogeneous and upstream data having a different set of features from downstream data is a realistic problem (Lewinson, 2020). In our medical data scenario, downstream patient data may include additional lab tests not available for patients in the upstream data. In fact, the additional downstream feature may not even be meaningful for the upstream data, such as medical exams only applicable to downstream patients of biological sex different from the upstream patients. In this section, we propose a pseudo-feature method for aligning the upstream and downstream data and show that the data heterogeneity problem can be addressed more effectively than simply taking the intersection of the upstream and downstream feature sets for tabular transfer learning, which would throw away useful features. The proposed pseudo-feature

method is related to missing data imputation Zhang et al. (2008); Sefidian and Daneshpour (2019); Yoon et al. (2018) and self-training ideas Tanha et al. (2017). In particular, misalignment of feature sets in upstream and downstream data can be seen as an extreme scenario with features having all values missing.

Suppose our upstream data  $(X_{u},Y_{u})$  is missing a feature  $x_{\mathrm{new}}$  present in the downstream data  $(X_d,Y_d)$ . We then use transfer learning in stages. As the diagram on the left panel of Figure 4 shows:

1. Pre-train feature extractor  $f: X_u \to Y_u$  on upstream data  $(X_u, Y_u)$  without feature  $x_{\mathrm{new}}$ .  
2. Fine-tune the feature extractor  $f$  on the downstream samples  $X_{d}$  to predict  $x_{\mathrm{new}}$  as the target and obtain a model  $\hat{f}:X_d\setminus \{x_{\mathrm{new}}\} \to x_{\mathrm{new}}$ .  
3. Use the model  $\hat{f}$  to assign pseudo-values  $\hat{x}_{\mathrm{new}}$  of the missing feature to the upstream samples:  $\hat{x}_{\mathrm{new}} = \hat{f}(X_u)$  thus obtaining augmented upstream data  $(X_u \cup \{\hat{x}_{\mathrm{new}}, Y_u)$ .  
4. Finally, we can leverage the augmented upstream data  $(X_{u}\cup \{\hat{x}_{\mathrm{new}}\} ,Y_{u})$  to pre-train a feature extractor which we will fine-tune on the original downstream task  $(X_{d},Y_{d})$  using all of the available downstream features.

Similarly, in scenarios with a missing feature in downstream data, we can directly train a feature predictor on the upstream data and obtain pseudo-values for the downstream data.

This approach offers appreciable performance boosts over discarding the missing features and often performs comparably to models pre-trained with the ground truth feature values as shown in the right panel of Figure 4. The top heatmap represents the experiment where downstream data has an additional feature missing from the upstream data. The bottom heatmap represents the opposite scenario of the upstream data having an additional feature not available in the downstream data. To ensure that the features we experiment with are meaningful and contain useful information, for each task we chose important features according to GBDT feature importances. We observe that in both experiments, using the pseudo feature is better than doing transfer learning with without the missing feature at all. Additionally, we observe that in some cases, the pseudo-feature approach performs comparably to using the original ground truth feature (10-100 samples on the top heatmap and 20 samples on the bottom heatmap). Interestingly, the pseudo-feature method is more beneficial when upstream features are missing, which suggests that having ground-truth values for the additional feature in the downstream data is more important.

# 7 DISCUSSION

In this paper, we demonstrate that deep tabular models with transfer learning definitively outperform strong GBDT baselines with stacking in a realistic scenario where the target downstream data is limited and auxiliary upstream pre-training data is available. We highlight that representation learning with neural networks enables more effective knowledge transfer than leveraging upstream task predictions through stacking. Additionally, we present a pseudo-feature method to enable effective transfer learning in challenging cases where the upstream and downstream feature sets differ. We provide suggestions regarding architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and setups for tabular transfer learning and hope that this work serves as a guide for practitioners.
