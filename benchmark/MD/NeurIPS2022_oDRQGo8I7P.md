# Abstract

Score-based generative models (SGMs) are a powerful class of generative models that exhibit remarkable empirical performance. Score-based generative modelling (SGM) consists of a "noising" stage, whereby a diffusion is used to gradually add Gaussian noise to data, and a generative model, which entails a "denoising" process defined by approximating the time-reversal of the diffusion. Existing SGMs assume that data is supported on a Euclidean space, i.e. a manifold with flat geometry. In many domains such as robotics, geoscience or protein modelling, data is often naturally described by distributions living on Riemannian manifolds and current SGM techniques are not appropriate. We introduce here Riemannian Score-based Generative Models (RSGMs), a class of generative models extending SGMs to compact Riemannian manifolds. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of manifolds, and in particular with earth and climate science spherical data.

# 1 Introduction

Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) (Song and Ermon, 2019; Song et al., 2021b; Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021) formulate generative modelling as a denoising process. Noise is incrementally added to data using a diffusion process until it gets approximately Gaussian. The generative model is then obtained by simulating an approximation of the corresponding time-reversal process, which progressively denoises a Gaussian sample to obtain a data sample. This process is also a diffusion whose drift depends on the logarithmic gradients of the noised data densities, i.e. the Stein scores, estimated using a neural network via score matching (Hyvärinen, 2005; Vincent, 2011).

SGMs have been primarily applied to data living on Euclidean spaces, i.e. manifolds with flat geometry. However, in a large number of scientific domains the distributions of interest are supported on Riemannian manifolds. These include, to name a few, protein modelling (Shapovalov and Dunbrack Jr, 2011), cell development (Klimovskaia et al., 2020), image recognition (Lui, 2012), geological sciences (Karpatne et al., 2018; Peel et al., 2001), graph-structured and hierarchical data (Roy et al., 2007; Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005), robotics (Feiten et al., 2013; Senanayake and Ramos, 2018) and high-energy physics (Brehmer and Cranmer, 2020).

We introduce in this work Riemannian Score-based Generative Models (RSGMs), an extension of SGMs to compact Riemannian manifolds which incorporate the geometry of the data by defining the forward diffusion process directly on the Riemannian manifold, inducing a manifold-valued reverse process. This requires constructing a noising process on the manifold that converges to an easy-to-sample reference distribution. We focus on the Brownian motion which converges with geometric rate to the uniform distribution on compact Riemannian manifolds (Saloff-Coste, 1994). We establish that, as in the Euclidean case, the corresponding time-reversal process is also a diffusion whose drift includes the Stein score which is intractable but can similarly be estimated via score matching. Methodological extensions are required as the transition kernel of the Brownian motion cannot be sampled exactly and is typically only available as an infinite sum through the Sturm-Liouville decomposition (Chavel, 1984) on compact Riemannian manifolds. To this end, we develop non-standard techniques for score estimation and rely on the use of Geodesic Random Walks for

sampling (Jorgensen, 1975). We provide theoretical convergence bounds for RSGMs and demonstrate our approach on a range of manifolds and tasks, including modelling a number of natural disaster occurrence datasets collected by Mathieu and Nickel (2020). We show that RGSMs achieve better performance than recent baselines (Mathieu and Nickel, 2020; Rozen et al., 2021) and scale better to high-dimensional manifolds.

# 2 Euclidean Score-based Generative Modelling

We recall here briefly the key concepts behind SGMs on the Euclidean space  $\mathbb{R}^d$  and refer the readers to Song et al. (2021b) for a more detailed introduction. We consider a forward noising process  $(\mathbf{X}_t)_{t\geq 0}$  defined by the following Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)

$$
\mathrm {d} \mathbf {X} _ {t} = - \mathbf {X} _ {t} \mathrm {d} t + \sqrt {2} \mathrm {d} \mathbf {B} _ {t}, \quad \mathbf {X} _ {0} \sim p _ {0}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $(\mathbf{B}_t)_{t\geq 0}$  is a  $d$  -dimensional Brownian motion and  $p_0$  is the data distribution. The available data gives us an empirical approximation of  $p_0$  . The process  $(\mathbf{X}_t)_{t\geq 0}$  is simply an Ornstein-Ulhenbeck (OU) process which converges with geometric rate to  $\mathrm{N}(0,\mathrm{Id})$  . Under mild conditions on  $p_0$  , the timereversed process  $(\mathbf{Y}_t)_{t\geq 0} = (\mathbf{X}_{T - t})_{t\in [0,T]}$  also satisfies an SDE (Cattiaux et al., 2021; Haussmann and Pardoux, 1986) given by

$$
\mathrm {d} \mathbf {Y} _ {t} = \left\{\mathbf {Y} _ {t} + 2 \nabla \log p _ {T - t} (\mathbf {Y} _ {t}) \right\} \mathrm {d} t + \sqrt {2} \mathrm {d} \mathbf {B} _ {t}, \quad \mathbf {Y} _ {0} \sim p _ {T}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $p_t$  denotes the density of  $\mathbf{X}_t$ . By construction, the law of  $\mathbf{Y}_{T - t}$  is equal to the law of  $\mathbf{X}_t$  for  $t\in [0,T]$  and in particular  $\mathbf{Y}_T\sim p_0$ . Hence, if one could sample from  $(\mathbf{Y}_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$  then its final distribution would be the data distribution  $p_0$ . Unfortunately we cannot sample exactly from (2) as  $p_T$  and the scores  $(\nabla \log p_t(x))_{t\in [0,T]}$  are intractable. Hence SGMs rely on a few approximations. First,  $p_T$  is replaced by the reference distribution  $\mathrm{N}(0,\mathrm{Id})$  as we know that  $p_T$  converges geometrically towards it. Second, the following denoising score matching identity is exploited to estimate the scores

$$
\nabla_ {x _ {t}} \log p _ {t} (x _ {t}) = \int_ {\mathbb {R} ^ {d}} \nabla_ {x _ {t}} \log p _ {t | 0} (x _ {t} | x _ {0}) p _ {0 | t} (x _ {0} | x _ {t}) \mathrm {d} x _ {0},
$$

where  $p_{t|0}(x_t|x_0)$  is the transition density of the OU process (1) which is available in closed-form. It follows directly that  $\nabla \log p_t$  is the minimizer of  $\ell_t(\mathbf{s}) = \mathbb{E}[\|\mathbf{s}(\mathbf{X}_t) - \nabla_{x_t}\log p_{t|0}(\mathbf{X}_t|\mathbf{X}_0)\|^2]$  over functions  $s$  where the expectation is over the joint distribution of  $\mathbf{X}_0, \mathbf{X}_t$ . This result can be leveraged by considering a neural network  $\mathbf{s}_{\theta}: [0,T] \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$  trained by minimizing the loss function  $\ell(\theta) = \int_0^T \lambda_t \ell_t(\mathbf{s}_{\theta}(t,\cdot)) \, \mathrm{d}t$  for some weighting function  $\lambda_t > 0$ . Finally, an Euler-Maruyama discretization of (2) is performed using a discretization step  $\gamma$  such that  $T = \gamma N$  for  $N \in \mathbb{N}$

$$
Y _ {n + 1} = Y _ {n} + \gamma \{Y _ {n} + 2 \mathbf {s} _ {\theta} (T - n \gamma , Y _ {n}) \} + \sqrt {2 \gamma} Z _ {n + 1}, \quad Y _ {0} \sim \mathrm {N} (0, \mathrm {I d}), \quad Z _ {n} \stackrel {\mathrm {i . i . d .}} {\sim} \mathrm {N} (0, \mathrm {I d}).
$$

The above showcases the basics of SGMs but we highlight that many improvements have been proposed; see (e.g. Song and Ermon, 2020; Jolicoeur-Martineau et al., 2021; Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021). In particular, selecting an adaptive stepsize  $(\gamma_{n})_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$  (Bao et al., 2022; Watson et al., 2021) and using a predictor-corrector scheme (Song et al., 2021b) instead of a simple Euler-Maruyama discretization drastically improves performance. Finally, SGMs can also be derived through variational and maximum likelihood techniques (Ho et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Song et al., 2021a).

# 3 Riemannian Score-based Generative Modelling

We now move to the manifold setting, and more specially assume that  $\mathcal{M}$  is a compact and connected Riemannian manifold. As discussed in Section 1, three components are required to extend SGM: i) a forward noising process on  $\mathcal{M}$  which converges to an easy-to-sample reference distribution, ii) a time-reversal formula on  $\mathcal{M}$  which defines a backward generative process, iii) a method to efficiently approximate the drift of the time-reversal process. We address all these problems in what follows to design RGSMs. The key differences between SGM and RSGM are summarized in Table 1.

# 3.1 Brownian motion and time-reversal on compact Riemannian manifolds

We use a Brownian motion  $(\mathbf{B}_t^{\mathcal{M}})_{t\geq 0}$  as the forward noising process on  $\mathcal{M}$  since it converges geometrically to the uniform distribution  $p_{\mathrm{ref}}$  under mild assumptions on  $\mathcal{M}$ , see Urakawa (2006, Proposition

2.6). For most manifolds of interest, one can either sample exactly from  $p_{\mathrm{ref}}$  or approximately with high accuracy. We refer to Appendix B.5 for an introduction to Brownian motions on manifolds.

We now derive a time-reversal formula for the manifold-valued forward diffusion. It is the Riemannian counterpart to the Euclidean time-reversal formula—e.g. see Cattiaux et al. (2021, Theorem 4.9). It shows that if  $(\mathbf{X}_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$  is a diffusion process then  $(\mathbf{X}_{T - t})_{t\in [0,T]}$  is also a diffusion process w.r.t. the backward filtration whose coefficients can be computed. The proof relies on an extension of Cattiaux et al. (2021, Theorem 4.9) to the Riemannian manifold case and is postponed to Appendix G.

This result and the other theoretical results presented in this paper rely on the following assumption, which is satisfied for a large class of manifolds  $\mathcal{M}$  such as the  $d$ -dimensional sphere and torus, compact matrix groups and products of these manifolds.

93 A1. There exist  $C, \alpha > 0$  such that for any  $t \in (0,1]$  and  $x \in \mathcal{M}$ ,  $p_{t|0}(x|x) \leq Ct^{-\alpha/2}$ , where  $p_{t|0}(\cdot|x_0)$  is the density of the heat kernel, i.e., the density of  $\mathbf{B}_t^{\mathcal{M}}$  with initial condition  $x_0$ .

Theorem 1 (Time-reversed diffusion). Assume A1. Let  $T \geq 0$  and  $(\mathbf{B}_t^{\mathcal{M}})_{t \geq 0}$  be a Brownian motion on  $\mathcal{M}$  such that  $\mathbf{B}_0^{\mathcal{M}}$  has distribution  $p_{\mathrm{ref}}$ . Let  $(\mathbf{X}_t)_{t \in [0, T]}$  associated with the SDE  $\mathrm{d}\mathbf{X}_t = b(\mathbf{X}_t)\mathrm{d}t + \mathrm{d}\mathbf{B}_t^{\mathcal{M}}$ . Let  $(\mathbf{Y}_t)_{t \in [0, T]} = (\mathbf{X}_{T - t})_{t \in [0, T]}$  and assume that  $\mathrm{KL}(\mathbb{P}|\mathbb{Q}) < +\infty$ , where  $\mathbb{Q}$  is the distribution of  $(\mathbf{B}_t^{\mathcal{M}})_{t \in [0, T]}$  and  $\mathbb{P}$  the distribution of  $(\mathbf{X}_t)_{t \in [0, T]}$ . In addition, assume that  $\mathbb{P}_t = \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{X}_t)$ , the distribution of  $\mathbf{X}_t$ , admits a smooth positive density  $p_t$  w.r.t.  $p_{\mathrm{ref}}$  for any  $t \in [0, T]$ . Then,  $(\mathbf{Y}_t)_{t \in [0, T]}$  is associated with

$$
\mathrm {d} \mathbf {Y} _ {t} = \left\{- b \left(\mathbf {Y} _ {t}\right) + \nabla \log p _ {T - t} \left(\mathbf {Y} _ {t}\right) \right\} \mathrm {d} t + \mathrm {d} \mathbf {B} _ {t} ^ {\mathcal {M}}. \tag {3}
$$

# 101 3.2 Approximate sampling of diffusions

Obtaining samples from a Brownian motion on a manifold is non-trivial in general. If  $\mathcal{M}$  is isometrically embedded into  $\mathbb{R}^p$  (with  $p\geq d$ ) one can define  $(\mathbf{B}_t^{\mathcal{M}})_{t\geq 0}$  as a  $\mathbb{R}^p$ -valued process, see Appendix B.5. However, this approach is extrinsic and requires the knowledge of the projection operator. Here we consider an intrinsic approach based on Geodesic Random Walks (GRWs), see Jorgensen (1975) for a review of their properties. GRWs are not restricted to approximating the Brownian motion on  $\mathcal{M}$  but in fact can approximate any well-behaved diffusion on  $\mathcal{M}$ . Hence, we introduce GRWs in a general framework and consider a discrete-time process  $(X_n^\gamma)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$  which approximates the diffusion  $(\mathbf{X}_t)_{t\geq 0}$  defined by

$$
\mathrm {d} \mathbf {X} _ {t} = b (t, \mathbf {X} _ {t}) \mathrm {d} t + \sigma (t, \mathbf {X} _ {t}) \mathrm {d} \mathbf {B} _ {t} ^ {\mathcal {M}}. \tag {4}
$$

This generalization will be key when sampling the backward diffusion process defined in Theorem 1. Definition 2 (Geodesic Random Walk). Let  $X_0^\gamma$  be a  $\mathcal{M}$ -valued random variable. For any  $\gamma > 0$ , we define  $(X_n^\gamma)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$  such that for any  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ,  $X_{n+1}^\gamma = \exp_{X_n^\gamma}[\gamma \{b(X_n^\gamma) + (1/\sqrt{\gamma})(V_{n+1} - b(X_n^\gamma))\}]^2$ , where  $(V_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$  is a sequence of TM-valued random variables such that for any  $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ,  $\mathbb{E}[V_{n+1} | \mathcal{F}_n] = b(X_n^\gamma)$  and  $\mathbb{E}[V_{n+1} V_{n+1}^\top | \mathcal{F}_n] = \sigma \sigma^\top(X_n^\gamma)$ , where  $\mathcal{F}_n$  is the filtration generated by  $\{X_k^\gamma\}_{k=0}$ . We say that the  $\mathcal{M}$ -valued process  $(X_n^\gamma)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$  is a Geodesic Random Walk.

Algorithm 1 approximately simulates the diffusion  $(\mathbf{X}_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$  defined in Equation (4) using GRWs; see Kuwada (2012); Cheng et al. (2022) for quantitative error bounds in the time-homogeneous case and Appendix H.1 for the time-inhomogeneous case.

# 3.3 Score approximation on Riemannian manifolds

Heat kernel on compact Riemannian manifolds. For any  $x_0 \in \mathcal{M}$  and  $t \geq s \geq 0$ , the heat kernel  $p_{t|s}(\cdot|x_s)$  is defined as the density of  $\mathbf{B}_t^{\mathcal{M}}$  w.r.t.  $p_{\mathrm{ref}}$  when  $\mathbf{B}_s^{\mathcal{M}} = x_s$ . Contrary to the Gaussian transition density of the OU process (or the Brownian motion) in the Euclidean setting, it is typically only available as an infinite series. In order to circumvent this issue we consider two techniques: i) a truncation approach, ii) a Taylor expansion around  $t = 0$  called a Varadhan asymptotics. First, we recall that in the case of compact manifolds the heat kernel is given by the Sturm-Liouville decomposition (Chavel, 1984) given for any  $t > 0$  and  $x_0, x_t \in \mathcal{M}$  by

$$
p _ {t \mid 0} \left(x _ {t} \mid x _ {0}\right) = \sum_ {j \in \mathbb {N}} \mathrm {e} ^ {- \lambda_ {j} t} \phi_ {j} \left(x _ {0}\right) \phi_ {j} \left(x _ {t}\right), \tag {5}
$$

where the convergence occurs in  $\mathrm{L}^2 (p_{\mathrm{ref}}\otimes p_{\mathrm{ref}})$ ,  $(\lambda_j)_{j\in \mathbb{N}}$  and  $(\phi_j)_{j\in \mathbb{N}}$  are the eigenvalues, respectively the eigenvectors, of  $-\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}$  in  $\mathrm{L}^2 (p_{\mathrm{ref}})$  (see Saloff-Coste, 1994, Section 2). When the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are known, we rely on an approximation of the logarithmic gradient of  $p_{t|0}$  by truncating the sum in Equation (S9) with  $J\in \mathbb{N}$  terms to obtain for any  $t > 0$  and  $x_0,x_t\in \mathcal{M}$

$$
\nabla_ {x _ {t}} \log p _ {t | 0} (x _ {t} | x _ {0}) \approx S _ {J, t} (x _ {0}, x _ {t}) \triangleq \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {J} \mathrm {e} ^ {- \lambda_ {j} t} \phi_ {j} (x _ {0}) \nabla_ {x _ {t}} \phi_ {j} (x _ {t}) / \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {J} \mathrm {e} ^ {- \lambda_ {j} t} \phi_ {j} (x _ {0}) \phi_ {j} (x _ {t}). \tag {6}
$$

Under regularity conditions on  $\mathcal{M}$  it can be shown that for any  $x, y \in \mathcal{M}$  and  $t \geq 0$ ,  $\lim_{J \to +\infty} S_{J,t}(x_0, x_t) = \nabla_{x_t} \log p_{t|0}(x_t|x_0)$  (see Jones et al., 2008, Lemma 1). In the case of the  $d$ -dimensional torus or sphere the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computable (see Saloff-Coste, 1994, Section 2) and we can apply this method to approximate  $p_{t|0}$  for any  $t > 0$ , see Appendix E.

When the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are unknown or not tractable, we can still derive an approximation of the heat kernel for small times  $t$ . Using Varadhan's asymptotics—see Bismut (1984, Theorem 3.8) or Chen et al. (2021, Theorem 2.1)—for any  $x, y \in \mathcal{M}$  with  $y \notin \mathrm{Cut}(x)$  (where  $\mathrm{Cut}(x)$  is the cut-locus of  $x$  in  $\mathcal{M}$  (see Lee, 2018, Chapter 10)) we have that

$$
\lim  _ {t \rightarrow 0} t \nabla_ {x _ {t}} \log p _ {t | 0} \left(x _ {t} \mid x _ {0}\right) = \exp_ {x _ {t}} ^ {- 1} \left(x _ {0}\right). \tag {7}
$$

Score-matching and loss functions. The reverse process from Equation (3) involves the Stein score  $\nabla \log p_t$  which is unfortunately intractable. To derive an approximation, we first remark that for any  $s,t\in (0,T]$  with  $t > s$  and  $x_{t}\in \mathcal{M}$ ,  $p_t(x_t) = \int_{\mathcal{M}}p_{t|s}(x_t|x_s)\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}_s(x_s)$ , where  $\mathbb{P}_s = \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{X}_s)$ . Thus, we have that for any  $s,t\in [0,T]$  with  $t > s$  and  $x_{t}\in \mathcal{M}$

$$
\nabla_ {x _ {t}} \log p _ {t} (x _ {t}) = \int_ {\mathcal {M}} \nabla_ {x _ {t}} \log p _ {t | s} (x _ {t} | x _ {s}) \mathbb {P} _ {s | t} (x _ {t}, \mathrm {d} x _ {s}).
$$

Hence, for any  $s,t\in [0,T]$  with  $t > s$  we have that  $\nabla \log p_t = \arg \min \{\ell_{t|s}(\mathbf{s}_t):\mathbf{s}_t\in \mathrm{L}^2 (\mathbb{P}_t)\}$ , where  $\ell_{t|s}(\mathbf{s}_t) = \int_{\mathcal{M}^2}\| \nabla_x\log p_{t|s}(x_t|x_s) - \mathbf{s}_t(x_t)\| ^2\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}_{s,t}(x_s,x_t)$ , which is referred as the Denoising Score Matching (DSM) loss. It can also be written in an implicit fashion.

Proposition 3. Let  $t, s \in (0, T]$  with  $t > s$ . Then, for any  $\mathbf{s}_t \in C^\infty(\mathcal{M})$ ,  $\ell_{t|s}(\mathbf{s}_t) = 2\ell_t^{\mathrm{im}}(\mathbf{s}_t) + \int_{\mathcal{M}^2} \| \nabla_{x_t} \log p_{t|s}(x_t|x_s) \|^2 \mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}_{s,t}(x_s,x_t)$ , where  $\ell_t^{\mathrm{im}}(\mathbf{s}_t) = \int_{\mathcal{M}} \left\{ \frac{1}{2} \| \mathbf{s}_t(x_t) \|^2 + \mathrm{div}(\mathbf{s}_t)(x_t) \right\} \mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}_t(x_t)$ .

The proof is postponed to Appendix I. For any  $t \in (0, T]$  the minimizers of the loss  $\ell_t^{\mathrm{im}}$  on  $\mathcal{X}(\mathcal{M})$  (where  $\mathcal{X}(\mathcal{M})$  is the set of vector fields on  $\mathcal{M}$ ) are the same as the ones for  $\ell_{t|s}$ . The loss  $\ell_t^{\mathrm{im}}$  is referred to as the implicit score matching (ISM) loss (Hyvärinen, 2005). Assume that we have access to  $\{\nabla \log p_{t|s} : T \leq t > s \geq 0\}$  or an approximation of this family, then we can use the DSM loss to learn  $\{\mathbf{s}_t \in \mathcal{X}(\mathcal{M}) : t \in [0, t]\}$ . If this is not the case then we turn to  $\ell_t^{\mathrm{im}}$ . Note that  $\ell_t^{\mathrm{im}}$  requires

the computation of a divergence term which requires  $d$  Jacobian-vector calls. In high dimension, a stochastic estimator is necessary (Hutchinson, 1989). Following Song and Ermon (2020); Nichol and Dhariwal (2021) the loss can be weighted with a term  $\lambda_t > 0$ . Using the results of the previous paragraph, we highlight three methods to compute  $\nabla \log p_t$  which are summarized in Table 2.

Parametric family of vector fields. We approximate  $(\nabla \log p_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$  by a family of functions  $\{\mathbf{s}_{\theta}\}_{\theta \in \Theta}$  where  $\Theta$  is a set of parameters and  $\mathbf{s}_{\theta}:[0,T]\to \mathcal{X}(\mathcal{M})$ . In a Euclidean space, vector fields are simply functions  $\mathbf{s}_{\theta}:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ . In manifolds, although for any  $x\in \mathcal{M}$ ,  $\mathrm{T}_x\mathcal{M}\cong \mathbb{R}^d$ , there does not necessarily exist a set of  $d$  smooth vector fields  $\{E_i\}_{i = 1}^d$  such that span  $\left(\{E_i(x)\}_{i = 1}^d\right) = \mathrm{T}_x\mathcal{M}$  (Chapter 8, page 179, Lee, 2006)<sup>3</sup>. Fortunately, one can rely on a larger set of smooth vector fields  $\{E_i(x)\}_{i = 1}^n$  with  $n > d$  that does span the tangent bundle. Then it suffices to construct a neural network  $\mathbf{s}_{\theta}:[0,T]\times \mathcal{M}\to \mathbb{R}^n$  to parametrize the score network as  $\mathbf{s}_{\theta}(t,x) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\mathbf{s}_{\theta}^{i}(t,x)E_{i}(x)$ . See Appendix D for a discussion on the choices of generating sets  $\{E_i(x)\}_{i = 1}^n$ .

Combining this parameterization with the score matching losses, the time-reversal formula of Theorem 1 and the sampling of forward and backward processes described in Section 3.1, we define our RSGM algorithm in Algorithm 2. This algorithm can also benefit from a predictor-corrector scheme as in (Song et al., 2021b), see Appendix F. The computational complexity of RSGM and some other methods is presented in Table 3.

Moser flow and RSGM training complexity varies if the Hutchinson stochastic estimator is used. See Table 2 for score matching losses complexity.

We now provide a theoretical analysis of RSGM. The following result ensures that RSGM generates samples whose distribution is close to the data distribution  $p_0$ . Let us denote  $\{Y_k\}_{n \in \{0, \dots, N\}}$  the sequence generated by Algorithm 2.

Theorem 4. Assume A1, that  $p_0$  is smooth and positive and that there exists  $\mathbb{M} \geq 0$  such that for any  $t \in [0,T]$  and  $x \in \mathcal{M}$ ,  $\| \mathbf{s}_{\theta^{\star}}(t,x) - \nabla \log p_t(x) \| \leq \mathbb{M}$ , with  $\mathbf{s}_{\theta^{\star}} \in \mathrm{C}([0,T],\mathcal{X}(\mathcal{M}))$ . Then if  $T > 1/2$ , there exists  $C \geq 0$  independent on  $T$  such that

$$
\mathbf {W} _ {1} \left(\mathcal {L} \left(Y _ {N}\right), p _ {0}\right) = C \left(\mathrm {e} ^ {- \lambda_ {1} T} + \sqrt {T / 2} \mathrm {M} + \mathrm {e} ^ {T} \gamma^ {1 / 2}\right),
$$

14: return  $\theta^*, \{Y_k\}_{k=0}^N$

where  $\mathbf{W}_1$  is the Wasserstein distance of order one on the probability measures on  $\mathcal{M}$ .

The proof is postponed to Appendix H. In particular, for any  $\varepsilon > 0$ , choosing  $T > 0$  large enough,  $\mathbb{M}$  small enough (which can be achieved using the universal property of neural networks) and  $\gamma$  small enough, we get that  $\mathbf{W}_1(\mathcal{L}(Y_N), p_0) \leq \varepsilon$ . This result might seem weaker than the result obtained for Moser flows in (Rozen et al., 2021, Theorem 3), but we emphasize that our bound takes into account the time-discretization contrary to Rozen et al. (2021) which considers the continuous-time flow. If we consider the time-reversed continuous-time SDE then we recover a bound in total variation distance, see Appendix H. One key element of our proof is the use of recent results providing quantitative bounds between GRW and the associated diffusion established by Cheng et al. (2022).

# 4 Related work

In this section we discuss previous work on parametrizing family of distributions for manifold-valued data. Here, the manifold structure is considered to be prescribed, in contrast with methods that jointly learn the manifold structure and density (e.g. Brehmer and Cranmer, 2020; Caterini et al., 2021).

Parametric family of distributions. The various parametric families of manifold-valued distributions that have been proposed can be categorized into three main approaches (Navarro et al., 2017): wrapping, projecting and conditioning. Wrapped distributions consider a parametric distribution on  $\mathbb{R}^n$  that is pushed-forward along a surjective map  $\psi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathcal{M}$ . Projected distributions are defined by marginalizing out some distribution along the normal bundle of  $\mathcal{M}$ . Conditioning distributions encompass the von Mises-Fisher and Kent distributions (Fisher, 1953; Kent, 1982). Considering mixtures of these distributions is key to increase flexibility (Peel et al., 2001; Mardia et al., 2008).

Push-forward of Euclidean normalizing flows. More recently, approaches leveraging the flexibility of normalizing flows (Papamakarios et al., 2019) have been proposed. Following the wrapping method described above, these methods parametrize a normalizing flow in  $\mathbb{R}^n$  before being pushed along an invertible map  $\psi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathcal{M}$ . However, to globally represent the manifold, the map  $\psi$  needs to be a homeomorphism, which can only happen if  $\mathcal{M}$  is topologically equivalent to  $\mathbb{R}^n$ , hence limiting the scope of that approach. One natural choice for this map is the exponential map  $\exp_x: \mathrm{T}_x\mathcal{M} \cong \mathbb{R}^d$ . This approach has been taken, for instance, by Falorsi et al. (2019) and Bose et al. (2020), respectively parametrizing distributions on Lie groups and hyperbolic space.

Neural ODE on manifolds. To avoid artifacts or numerical instabilities due to the manifold embedding, another line of work uses tools from Riemannian geometry to define flows directly on the manifold of interest (Falorsi and Forre, 2020; Mathieu and Nickel, 2020; Falorsi, 2021). Since these methods do not require a specific embedding mapping, they are referred as Riemannian. They extend continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) (Grathwohl et al., 2019) to the manifold setting, by simplicity parametrizing flows as solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). As such, the parametric flow is a continuous function of time. This approach has recently been extended by Rozen et al. (2021) introducing Moser flows, whose main appeal being that it circumvents the need to solve an

ODE in the training process. We refer to Appendix J for an in-depth discussion on the links between our work and Moser flows.

Optimal transport on manifolds. Another line of work has developed flows on manifolds using tools from optimal transport. Sei (2013) introduced a flow that is given by  $f_{\theta}:x\mapsto \exp_{x}(\nabla \psi_{\theta}^{c})$  with  $\psi_{\theta}^{c}$  a  $c$ -convex function and  $c = d_{\mathcal{M}}^2$  the squared geodesic distance. This approach is motivated by the fact that the optimal transport map takes such an expression (Ambrosio, 2003). These methods operate directly on the manifold, similarly to CNFs, yet in contrast they are discrete in time. The benefits of this approach depend on the specific choice of parametric family of  $c$ -convex functions (Rezende and Racanière, 2021; Cohen et al., 2021), trading-off expressivity with scalability. In the case of tori and spheres, Rezende et al. (2020) introduced discrete Riemannian flows based on Möbius transformations and spherical splines.

# 5 Experiments

In this section we benchmark the empirical performance of RSGMs along with other manifold-valued methods introduced in Section 4. First, we assess their modelling capacity on earth and climate science spherical data. Then, we test the methods scalability with respect to manifold dimensions with a synthetic experiment on the torus  $\mathbb{T}^d$ . Eventually, we evaluate the models' regularity and time complexity with a synthetic  $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{R})$  target. Experimental details are provided in Appendix M.

# 5.1 Earth and climate science datasets on the sphere

We start by evaluating RSGMs on a collection of simple datasets, each containing an empirical distribution of occurrences of earth and climate science events on the surface of the earth. These events are: volcanic eruptions (NGDC/WDS), earthquakes (NGDC/WDS), floods (Brakenridge, 2017) and wild fires (EOSDIS, 2020). We compare to previous baseline methods: Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flows (Mathieu and Nickel, 2020), Moser Flows (Rozen et al., 2021) and a mixture of Kent distributions (Peel et al., 2001). Additionally, we consider a standard SGM on the 2D plane followed by the inverse stereographic projection which induces a density on the sphere (Gemici et al., 2016). We evaluate the log-likelihood of each model, extending to the manifold setting the likelihood computation techniques of SGMs, see Appendix C. We observe from Table 4, that all benchmarked methods have comparable performance when evaluated on these simple tasks with RSGM performing marginally better on most datasets. However, we empirically notice that Moser flows are slow to train and additionally that both Moser flows and stereographic SGMs are computationally expensive to evaluate. These observations motivate further empirical investigations that are conducted in Sections 5.2 and 5.3.

# 5.2 Synthetic data on torii

We now move to another manifold, that is the torus  $\mathbb{T}^d = \mathbb{S}^1\times \dots \times \mathbb{S}^1$ , so as to assess the scalability of the different methods with respect to the dimension  $d$ . We consider a wrapped Gaussian target distribution on  $\mathbb{T}^d$  with a random mean and unit variance. Moser flows' (Rozen et al., 2021) loss involves a regularization term which involves an integral over the manifold, approximated by a Monte Carlo (MC) estimator with uniform proposal. This term regularizes Moser flows towards probability measures, i.e. with unit volume. We thus expect Moser flows to fail in high-dimension as

We report two likelihoods, the 'Moser' closed form density—not guaranteed to be normalized—and the 'ODE' likelihood given by solving an augmented ODE (as in CNFs) with the vector field induced by the Moser flow density—which is guaranteed to have unit volume. The closed form density can thus only be used for training purposes only. Sampling and evaluating the true likelihood of Moser flows becomes prohibitively expensive in high dimension due to small due to stiff induced vector fields.

Moser Flow (K=1000, ODE likelihood)

the number of samples  $K$  required for the MC estimator to be accurate will grows as  $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{e}^d)$ , and the memory required to compute this estimator grows either in  $\mathcal{O}(Kd)$  for exact divergences or  $\mathcal{O}(K)$  for approximated divergences (see Table 3).

In Figure 2, we observe that RSGMs are able to fit well the target distribution even in high dimension, with a linear or constant computational cost—depending on the divergence estimator. In contrast, Moser flows scale poorly with the dimension, to the extent that we are unable to train them for  $d \geq 10$ . This is due to the combination of the complexity which grows linearly with both the dimension  $d$  and the number of MC samples  $K$ , which itself ought to grow exponentially with  $d$ —as discussed in the previous paragraph. This is illustrated by the gap between the 'Moser' and 'ODE' likelihoods which increases with the manifold dimension (see left Figure 2).

# 5.3 Synthetic data on the Special Orthogonal group

In order to demonstrate the broad range of applicability of our model we now turn to the task of density estimation on the special orthogonal group  $\mathrm{SO}_d(\mathbb{R}) = \{\mathrm{Q}\in \mathrm{M}_d(\mathbb{R}):\mathrm{QQ}^\top = \mathrm{Id},\det (\mathrm{Q}) = 1\}$ . Applications with orthogonal constraints span various fields, such as molecular sciences (Ganea et al., 2022), computer vision (Prokudin et al., 2018) and medical science (Hou et al., 2018). We consider the synthetic dataset consisting of samples in  $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{R})$  from the mixture distribution with density  $p(\mathrm{Q}) = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m = 1}^{M}\mathrm{N}^{W}(\mathrm{Q}| \mathrm{Q}_{m},\sigma_{m}^{2})$  with  $M\in \mathbb{N}$ , where  $\mathrm{N}^W (\mathrm{Q}_m,\sigma_m^2)$  are wrapped Normal distributions with expectation  $\mathrm{Q}_m$  and variance  $\sigma_m^2$ .

We compare RSGMs against Moser flows and a wrapped-exponential baseline inspired by Falorsi et al. (2019)—where we parametrize a standard Euclidean SGM on  $\mathfrak{so}(3)$  that is then pushed-forward on  $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{R})$ . RSGMs are trained using the  $\ell_{t|0}$  (DSM) loss with the Varadhan approximation (see Table 2). From Table 5 we observe that, RSGMs perform consistently, whether the target distribution has few or many mixture components  $M$ , as opposed to Exp-wrapped SGMs and Moser flows which only perform well in some range of  $M$ . Similarly to Section 5.2, we find Moser flows to be much slower to train due to the large number of Monte Carlo samples needed in the reguralizer ( $K = 10^4$ ). We also note from Table 5 that the number of score network evaluations (NFE) is significantly lower for RSGMs, and is particularly detrimental for Moser flows ( $\gg 10^3$ ). This has the direct consequence of dramatically slowing down any sampling and likelihood evaluation of Moser flows. Additionally, since the NFE is a proxy of the learnt dynamics smoothness—defined as  $\int_0^1 \int_{\mathcal{M}} \| \mathbf{s}_\theta(t, x_t) \|^2 \, \mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}_t(x_t) \, \mathrm{d}t$ , we can conclude that RSGMs induce 'simpler' models in that sense. We believe that this is due to Moser flows performing the interpolation in density space whereas RSGMs perform the interpolation in sample space (see Appendix J). Additionally, we found RSGMs to be more robust w.r.t. the choice of hyperparameters than the Exp-wrapped SGMs as shown in Figure 3b, on top of converging faster.

# 6 Discussion and limitations

In this paper we introduced Riemannian Score-Based Generative Models (RSGMs), a class of deep generative models that represent target densities supported on compact manifolds, as the time-reversal of a Brownian motion. The main benefits of our method stems from its scalability to high dimensions, its applicability to a broad class of manifolds due to the diversity of available loss functions, its robustness and crucially its capacity to model complex datasets. We also provided theoretical guarantees on the convergence of RSGMs. We empirically demonstrated that our method outperforms previous work both in terms of density estimation and scalability on a range of manifolds and datasets.

An important future work direction, and a current limitation, is the manifold compactness assumption. Several important manifolds do not fit into this category, such as the special linear group, symmetric positive definite matrices or the hyperbolic space (Ungar, 2005). Another promising extension concerns stochastic control on manifolds and more precisely, deriving efficient algorithms to solve Schrödinger bridges in the same spirit as De Bortoli et al. (2021) on Euclidean state spaces.
