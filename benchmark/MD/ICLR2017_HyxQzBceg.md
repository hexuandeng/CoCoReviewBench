# ABSTRACT

We present a variational approximation to the information bottleneck of Tishby et al. (1999). This variational approach allows us to parameterize the information bottleneck model using a neural network and leverage the reparameterization trick for efficient training. We call this method "Deep Variational Information Bottleneck", or Deep VIB. We show that models trained with the VIB objective outperform those that are trained with other forms of regularization, in terms of generalization performance and robustness to adversarial attack.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

We adopt an information theoretic view of deep networks. We regard the internal representation of some intermediate layer as a stochastic encoding  $Z$  of the input source  $X$ , defined by a parametric encoder  $p(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta})$ . Our goal is to learn an encoding that is maximally informative about our target  $Y$ , measured by the mutual information between our encoding and the target  $I(Z,Y;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ , where

$$
I (Z, Y; \boldsymbol {\theta}) = \int d x d y p (z, y | \boldsymbol {\theta}) \log \frac {p (z , y | \boldsymbol {\theta})}{p (z | \boldsymbol {\theta}) p (y | \boldsymbol {\theta})}. ^ {2} \tag {1}
$$

Given the data processing inequality, and the invariance of the mutual information to reparameterizations, if this was our only objective we could always ensure a maximally informative representation by taking the identity encoding of our data  $(Z = X)$ , but this is not a useful representation of our data. Instead we would like to find the best representation we can obtain subject to a constraint on its complexity. A natural and useful constraint to apply is on the mutual information between our encoding and the original data,  $I(X,Z) \leq I_c$ , where  $I_c$  is the information constraint. This suggests the objective:

$$
\max  _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} I (Z, Y; \boldsymbol {\theta}) \text {s . t .} I (X, Z; \boldsymbol {\theta}) \leq I _ {c}. \tag {2}
$$

Equivalently, with the introduction of a Lagrange multiplier  $\beta$ , we can maximize the objective function

$$
R _ {I B} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) = I (Z, Y; \boldsymbol {\theta}) - \beta I (Z, X; \boldsymbol {\theta}). \tag {3}
$$

Here our goal is to learn an encoding  $Z$  that is maximally expressive about  $Y$  while being maximally compressive about  $X$ , where  $\beta \geq 0$  controls the tradeoff. This approach is known as the information bottleneck (IB), and was first proposed in Tishby et al. (1999). Intuitively, the first term in  $R_{IB}$  encourages  $Z$  to be predictive of  $Y$ ; the second term encourages  $Z$  to "forget"  $X$ . Essentially it forces  $Z$  to act like a minimal sufficient statistic of  $X$  for predicting  $Y$ .

The IB principle is appealing, since it defines what we mean by a good representation, in terms of the fundamental tradeoff between having a concise representation and one with good predictive power (Tishby & Zaslavsky, 2015a). The main drawback of the IB principle is that computing mutual information is, in general, computationally challenging. There are two notable exceptions: the first

is when  $X, Y$  and  $Z$  are all discrete, as in Tishby et al. (1999); this can be used to cluster discrete data, such as words. The second case is when  $X, Y$  and  $Z$  are all jointly Gaussian (Chechik et al., 2005). However, these assumptions both severely constrain the class of learnable models.

In this paper, we propose to use variational inference to construct a lower bound on the IB objective in Equation 3. We call the resulting method VIB (variational information bottleneck). By using the reparameterization trick (Kingma & Welling, 2014), we can use Monte Carlo sampling to get an unbiased estimate of the gradient, and hence we can optimize the objective using stochastic gradient descent. This allows us to use deep neural networks to parameterize our distributions, and thus to handle high dimensional, continuous data, such as images, avoiding the previous restrictions to the discrete or Gaussian cases.

We also show, by a series of experiments, that stochastic neural networks, fit using our VIB method, are robust to overfitting, since VIB finds a representation  $Z$  which ignores as many details of the input  $X$  as possible. In addition, they are more robust to adversarial inputs than deterministic models which are fit using (penalized) maximum likelihood estimation. Intuitively this is because each input image gets mapped to a distribution rather than a unique  $Z$ , so it is more difficult to pass small, idiosyncratic perturbations through the latent bottleneck.

# 2 RELATED WORK

The idea of using information theoretic objectives for deep neural networks was pointed out in Tishby & Zaslavsky (2015b). However, they did not include any experimental results, since their approach for optimizing the IB objective relied on the iterative Blahut Arimoto algorithm, which is infeasible to apply to deep neural networks.

Variational inference is a natural way to approximate the problem. Variational bounds on mutual information have previously been explored in Agakov (2004), though not in conjunction with the information bottleneck objective. Mohamed & Rezende (2015) also explore variational bounds on mutual information, and apply them to deep neural networks, but in the context of reinforcement learning. We recently discovered Chalk et al. (2016), who independently developed the same variational lower bound on the IB objective as us. However, they apply it to sparse coding problems, and use the kernel trick to achieve nonlinear mappings, whereas we apply it to deep neural networks, which are computationally more efficient. In addition, we are able to handle large datasets by using stochastic gradient descent, whereas they use batch variational EM.

In the supervised learning literature, our work is closely related to the recently proposed confidence penalty (entropy regularization) method of (Pereyra et al., 2016). In this work, they fit a deterministic network by optimizing an objective that combines the usual cross entropy loss with an extra term which penalizes models for having low entropy predictive distributions. In more detail, their cost function has the form

$$
J _ {C P} = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} [ H (p (y | y _ {n}), p (y | x _ {n})) - \beta H (p (y | x _ {n})) ] \tag {4}
$$

where  $H(p,q) = -\sum_{y}p(y)\log q(y)$  is the cross entropy,  $H(p) = H(p,p)$  is the entropy,  $p(y|y_n) = \delta_{y_n}(y)$  is a one-hot encoding of the label  $y_{n}$ , and  $N$  is the number of training examples. (Note that setting  $\beta = 0$  corresponds to the usual maximum likelihood estimate.) In (Pereyra et al., 2016) they show that CP performs better than the simpler technique of label smoothing, in which we replace the zeros in the one-hot encoding of the labels by  $\epsilon >0$ , and then renormalize so that the distribution still sums to one. We will compare our VIB method to both confidence penalty and label smoothing in Section 4.1.

In the unsupervised learning literature, our work is closely related to the work in Kingma & Welling (2014) on variational autoencoders. In fact, their method is a special case of an unsupervised version of the VIB, but with the  $\beta$  parameter fixed at 1.0, as we explain in Appendix A. (The VAE objective, but with different values of  $\beta$ , was also explored in Higgins et al. (2016), but from a different perspective.)

# 3 METHOD

Following standard practice in the IB literature, we assume that the joint distribution  $p(X,Y,Z)$  factors as follows:

$$
p (X, Y, Z) = p (Z \mid X, Y) p (Y \mid X) p (X) = p (Z \mid X) p (Y \mid X) p (X) \tag {5}
$$

i.e., we assume  $p(Z|X,Y) = p(Z|X)$ , corresponding to the Markov chain  $Y \leftrightarrow X \leftrightarrow Z$ . This restriction means that our representation  $Z$  cannot depend directly on the labels  $Y$ . (This opens the door to unsupervised representation learning, which we will discuss in Appendix A.)

Recall that the IB objective has the form  $I(Z, Y) - \beta I(Z, X)$ . We will examine each of these expressions in turn. Let us start with  $I(Z, Y)$ . Writing it out in full, this becomes

$$
I (Z, Y) = \int d y d z p (y, z) \log \frac {p (y , z)}{p (y) p (z)} = \int d y d z p (y, z) \log \frac {p (y | z)}{p (y)}. \tag {6}
$$

where  $p(y|z)$  is defined by our encoder and Markov Chain as follows:

$$
p (y | z) = \int d x p (y, x | z) = \int d x p (y | x) p (x | z) = \int d x \frac {p (y | x) p (z | x) p (x)}{p (z)}. \tag {7}
$$

Since this is intractable in our case, let  $q(y|z)$  be a variational approximation to  $p(y|z)$ . This is our decoder, which we will take to be another neural network with its own set of parameters. Using the fact that the Kullback Leibler divergence is always positive, we have

$$
\operatorname {K L} [ p (Y | Z), q (Y | Z) ] \geq 0 \Rightarrow \int d y p (y | z) \log p (y | z) \geq \int d y p (y | z) \log q (y | z), \tag {8}
$$

and hence

$$
\begin{array}{l} I (Z, Y) \geq \int d y d z p (y, z) \log \frac {q (z | y)}{p (y)} (9) \\ = \int d y d z p (y, z) \log q (z | y) - \int d y p (y) \log p (y) (10) \\ = \int d y d z p (y, z) \log q (z | y) + H (Y). (11) \\ \end{array}
$$

Notice that the entropy of our labels  $H(Y)$  is something outside of our control and so can be ignored for the purposes of optimization.

Focusing on the first term in Equation 11, we can rewrite  $p(y,z)$  as  $p(y,z) = \int dx p(x,y,z) = \int dx p(x)p(y|x)p(z|x)$  (leveraging our Markov assumption), which gives us a lower bound on the first term of our objective:

$$
I (Z, Y) \geq \int d x d y d z p (x) p (y | x) p (z | x) \log q (y | z). \tag {12}
$$

We now consider the term  $\beta I(Z,X)$

$$
I (Z, X) = \int d z d x p (x, z) \log \frac {p (z | x)}{p (z)} = \int d z d x p (x, z) \log p (z | x) - \int d z p (z) \log p (z). \tag {13}
$$

In general, computing the marginal distribution of  $Z$ ,  $p(z) = \int dx p(z|x)p(x)$ , might be difficult. So let  $r(z)$  be a variational approximation to this marginal. Since  $\mathrm{KL}[p(Z),r(\bar{Z})]\geq 0\Rightarrow \int dz p(z)\log p(z)\geq \int dz p(z)\log r(z)$ , we have the following upper bound:

$$
I (Z, X) \leq \int d x d z p (x) p (z | x) \log \frac {p (z | x)}{r (z)}. \tag {14}
$$

Combining both of these bounds we have that

$$
\begin{array}{l} I (Z, Y) - \beta I (Z, X) \geq \int d x d y d z p (x) p (y | x) p (z | x) \log q (y | z) \\ - \beta \int d x d z p (x) p (z | x) \log \frac {p (z | x)}{r (z)} = L. \tag {15} \\ \end{array}
$$

We now discuss how to compute the lower bound  $L$  in practice. We can approximate  $p(x,y) = p(x)p(y|x)$  using the empirical data distribution  $p(x,y) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\delta_{x_n}(x)\delta_{y_n}(y)$ , and hence we can write

$$
L \approx \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \left[ \int d z p (z | x _ {n}) \log q \left(y _ {n} | z\right) - \beta p (z | x _ {n}) \log \frac {p (z | x _ {n})}{r (z)} \right]. \tag {16}
$$

Suppose we use an encoder of the form  $p(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(z|f_e^\mu (x),f_e^\Sigma (x))$ , where  $f_{e}$  is an MLP which outputs both the  $K$  dimensional mean  $\mu$  of  $z$  as well as the  $K\times K$  covariance matrix  $\Sigma$ . Then we can use the reparameterization trick (Kingma & Welling, 2014) to write  $p(z|x)dz = p(\epsilon)d\epsilon$ , where  $z = f(x,\epsilon)$  is a deterministic function of  $x$  and the Gaussian random variable  $\epsilon$ . This formulation has the important advantage that the noise term is independent of the parameters of the model, so it is easy to take gradients.

Assuming our choice of  $p(z|x)$  and  $r(z)$  allows computation of an analytic Kullback-Leibler divergence, we can put everything together to get the following objective function, which we will try to minimize:

$$
J _ {I B} = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \mathbb {E} _ {\epsilon \sim p (\epsilon)} \left[ - \log q \left(y _ {n} \mid f \left(x _ {n}, \epsilon\right)\right) \right] + \beta \operatorname {K L} [ p (Z | x _ {n}), r (Z) ]. \tag {17}
$$

As in Kingma & Welling (2014), this formulation allows us to directly backpropagate through a single sample of our stochastic code and ensure that our gradient is an unbiased estimate of the true expected gradient.

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, we present various experimental results, comparing the behavior of standard deterministic networks to stochastic neural networks trained by optimizing the VIB objective. For simplicity, we restrict attention to the well-known MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 28x28 images of hand-drawn digits, from 10 classes.

In all the experiments, the encoder has the form  $p(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(z|f_e^\mu (x),f_e^\Sigma (x))$ . The  $f_{e}$  MLP has two hidden layers of size 1024, and uses standard biased ReLU activations. The  $\mu$  and  $\Sigma$  layers are each of size  $K$ , and are biased and linear. The decoder is a logistic regression model of the form  $q(y|z) = S(y|f_d(z))$ , where  $f_{d}(z) = Wz + b$  returns the logits over the  $C = 10$  classes, and  $S(a) = [\exp (a_c) / \sum_{c' = 1}^{C}\exp (a_{c'})]$  is the softmax function. Finally, we treat  $r(z)$  as a fixed  $K$  dimensional spherical Gaussian,  $r(z) = \mathcal{N}(z|0,I)$ .

In the special case that  $\beta = 0$ , we obtain the following objective function:

$$
J _ {I B 0} = - \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} E _ {z \sim \mathcal {N} \left(f _ {e} ^ {\mu} \left(x _ {n}\right), f _ {e} ^ {\Sigma} \left(x _ {n}\right)\right)} [ \log \mathcal {S} \left(y _ {n} \mid f _ {d} (z) \right] \tag {18}
$$

When  $\beta \to 0$ , we observe the VIB optimization process tends to make  $f_{e}^{\Sigma}(x) \to 0$ , so the network becomes nearly deterministic. In our experiments we also train an explicitly deterministic model that has the same form as the stochastic model, except that we just use  $z = f_{e}^{\mu}(x)$  as the hidden encoding, and drop the Gaussian layer.

# 4.1 BEHAVIOR ON MNIST

Table 1: Test set misclassification rate on MNIST using  $K = 256$ . We compare our method (VIB) to an equivalent deterministic model using various forms of regularization. The discrepancy between our results for confidence penalty and label smoothing and the numbers reported in (Pereyra et al., 2016) are due to slightly different hyperparameters.

# 4.1.1 HIGHER DIMENSIONAL EMBEDDING

To demonstrate that our VIB method can achieve competitive classification results, we compared against a deterministic MLP trained with various forms of regularization. We use a  $K = 256$  dimensional bottleneck and a diagonal Gaussian for  $p(z|x)$ . The networks were trained using Tensorflow for 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 0.001.

The results are shown in Table 1. We see that we can slightly outperform other forms of regularization that have been proposed in the literature. Of course, the performance varies depending on  $\beta$ . Figure 1(a) plots the train and test error vs  $\beta$ , for the case where we use a single Monte Carlo sample of  $z$  when predicting, and also for the case where we average over 12 posterior samples (i.e., we use  $p(y|x) = \frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^{S}q(y|z^s)$  for  $z^s \sim p(z|x)$ , where  $S = 12$ ).

We see several interesting properties in Figure 1(a). First, we notice that the error rate shoots up once  $\beta$  rises above the critical value of  $\beta \sim 10^{-2}$ . This corresponds to a setting where the mutual information between  $X$  and  $Z$  is less than  $\log_2(10)$  bits, so the model can no longer represent the fact that there are 10 different classes. Second, we notice that, for small values of  $\beta$ , the test error is higher than the training error, which indicates that we are overfitting. This is because the network learns to be more deterministic, forcing  $\sigma \approx 0$ , thus reducing the benefits of regularization. Third, we notice that for intermediate values of  $\beta$ , Monte Carlo averaging helps.

In Figure 1(c), we plot the IB curve, i.e., we plot  $I(Z,Y)$  vs  $I(Z,X)$  as we vary  $\beta$ . As we allow more information from the input through to the bottleneck (by lowering  $\beta$ ), we increase the mutual information between our embedding and the label on the training set, but not necessarily on the test set, as is evident from the plot.

In Figure 1(d) we plot the second term in our objective, the upper bound on the mutual information between the images  $X$  and our stochastic encoding  $Z$ , which in our case is simply the relative entropy between our encoding and the fixed isotropic unit Gaussian prior. Notice that the  $y$ -axis is a logarithmic one. This demonstrates that our best results (when  $\beta$  is between  $10^{-3}$  and  $10^{-2}$ ) occur where the mutual information between the stochastic encoding and the images is on the order of 10 to 100 bits.

# 4.1.2 TWO DIMENSIONAL EMBEDDING

To better understand the behavior of our method, we refit our model to MNIST using a  $K = 2$  dimensional bottleneck, but using a full covariance Gaussian. (The neural net predicts the mean and the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix.) Figure 1(b) shows that, not surprisingly, the classification performance is worse, but the overall trends are the same as in the  $K = 256$  dimensional case. The IB curve (not shown) also has a similar shape to before, except now the gap between training and testing is even larger.

Figure 2 provides a visualization of what the network is doing. We plot the posteriors  $p(z|x)$  as a 2d Gaussian ellipse (representing the  $95\%$  confidence region) for 1000 images from the test set. Colors

The spike in the error rate at  $\beta \sim 10^{-2}$  corresponds to a model that is too highly regularized. (b) Same as (a), but for  $K = 2$ . Performance is much worse, since we pass through a very narrow bottleneck. (c)  $I(Z,Y)$  vs  $I(Z,X)$  as we vary  $\beta$  for  $K = 256$ .

Figure 2: Visualizing embeddings of 1000 test images in two dimensions. We plot the  $95\%$  confidence interval of the Gaussian posterior  $p(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$  as an ellipse. The images are colored according to their true class label. The background greyscale image denotes the entropy of the variational classifier evaluated at each two dimensional location. As  $\beta$  becomes smaller, and we forget more about the input, the embeddings start to overlap to such a degree that the classes become indistinguishable. We also report the test error using a single sample,  $\mathrm{err}_1$ , and using 12 Monte Carlo samples,  $\mathrm{err}_{\mathrm{mc}}$ . For "good" values of  $\beta$ , a single sample suffices.

(c)  $\beta = 10^{0}$ ,  $\mathrm{err}_{\mathrm{MC}} = 33.82\%$ ,  
$\mathrm{err}_1 = 62.81\%$

We see several interesting properties. First, as  $\beta$  decreases (so we pass less information through), the posterior covariances become larger, and the classes start to overlap. Second, once  $\beta$  passes a critical value, the encoding "collapses", and essentially all the class information is lost. Third, there is a fair amount of posterior uncertainty in the predictive distribution  $q(y|z)$  in the areas between the class embeddings. Fourth, for intermediate values of  $\beta$  (say  $10^{-1}$  in Figure 2(b)), predictive performance is still good, even though there is a lot of uncertainty about where any individual image will map to. This means it would be difficult for an outside agent to infer which particular instance the model is representing, a property which we will explore more in the following sections.

# 4.2 BEHAVIOR ON ADVERSARIAL IMAGES

Szegedy et al. (2013) was the first work to show that deep neural networks (and other kinds of classifiers) can be easily "fooled" into making mistakes by changing their inputs by imperceptibly small amounts. In this section, we will show how training with the VIB objective makes models significantly more robust to such adversarial inputs.

# 4.2.1 TYPES OF ADVERSARIES

Since the initial work by Szegedy et al. (2013) and Goodfellow et al. (2014), many different adversaries have been proposed. Most attacks fall into three broad categories: optimization-based attacks (Szegedy et al., 2013; Carlini & Wagner, 2016; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Papernot et al., 2015; Robinson & Graham, 2015; Sabour et al., 2016), which directly run an optimizer such as L-BFGS or ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2015) on image pixels to find a minimal perturbation that changes the model's classification; single-step gradient-based attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kurakin et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2015), which choose a gradient direction of the image pixels at some loss, and then take a single step in that direction; and iterative gradient-based attacks (Kurakin et al., 2016), which take multiple small steps along the gradient direction of the image pixels at some loss, recomputing the gradient direction at each step. $^{5}$

Many adversaries can be formalized as either untargeted or targeted variants. An untargeted adversary can be defined as  $A(X, M) \to X'$ , where  $A(.)$  is the adversarial function,  $X$  is the input image,  $X'$  is the perturbed output, and  $M$  is the target model.  $A$  is considered successful if  $M(X) \neq M(X')$ . Recently, Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. (2016) showed how to create a "universal" adversarial perturbation  $\delta$  that can be added to any image  $X$  in order to make  $M(X + \delta) \neq M(X)$ .

A targeted adversary can be defined as  $A(X, M, l) \to X'$ , where  $l$  is an additional target label, and  $A$  is only considered successful if  $M(X') = l$ . Targeted attacks usually require larger magnitude perturbations, since the adversary cannot just "nudge" the input across the nearest decision boundary, but instead must force it into a desired decision region.

In this work, we focus on the  $L_{2}$  attack method proposed in Carlini & Wagner (2016), which has been shown to attack more models with smaller perturbations than any other method published to date. We consider both targeted attacks and untargeted attacks.<sup>7</sup>

# 4.2.2 ADVERSARIAL ROBUSTNESS

There are multiple definitions of adversarial robustness in the literature. The most basic, which we shall use, is accuracy on adversarially perturbed versions of the test set.

It is also important to have a measure of the magnitude of the adversarial perturbation. Since adversaries are defined relative to human perception, the ideal measure would explicitly correspond to how easily a human observer would notice the perturbation. In lieu of such a measure, it is common to compute the size of the perturbation using  $L_0$ ,  $L_1$ ,  $L_2$ , and  $L_{\infty}$  norms (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Carlini & Wagner, 2016; Sabour et al., 2016). In particular, the  $L_0$  norm measures the number of perturbed pixels, the  $L_2$  norm measures the Euclidean distance between  $X$  and  $X'$ , and the  $L_{\infty}$  norm measures the largest single change to any pixel.

# 4.2.3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

We used the same model architectures as in Section 4.1, using a  $K = 256$  bottleneck. The architectures included a deterministic (base) model trained by MLE; a deterministic model trained with dropout (the dropout rate was chosen on the validation set); and a stochastic model trained with VIB for various values of  $\beta$ .

For the VIB models, we use 12 posterior samples of  $Z$  to compute the predictive distribution  $p(y|x)$ . This helps ensure that the adversaries can get a consistent gradient when constructing the perturbation, and that they can get a consistent evaluation when checking if the perturbation was successful (i.e., it reduces the chance that the adversary "gets lucky" in its perturbation due to an untypical sample). We also ran the VIB models in "mean mode", where the  $\sigma$ s are forced to be 0. This had no noticeable impact on the results, so all reported results are for normal stochastic evaluation.

# 4.2.4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We selected the first 10 zeros in the MNIST test set, and use the L2 optimization adversary of Carlini & Wagner (2016) to try to perturb those zeros into ones. Some sample results are shown in Figure 3. We see that the deterministic models are easily fooled by making small perturbations, but for the VIB models with reasonably large  $\beta$ , the adversary often fails to find an attack (indicated by the green borders) within the permitted number of iterations. Furthermore, when an attack is successful, it needs to be much larger for the VIB models. To quantify this, Figure 4(a) plots the magnitude of the perturbation (relative to that of the deterministic model) needed for a successful attack as a

function of  $\beta$ . As  $\beta$  increases, the  $L_{0}$  norm of the perturbation decreases, but both  $L_{2}$  and  $L_{\infty}$  norms increase, indicating that the adversary is being forced to put larger modifications into fewer pixels while searching for an adversarial perturbation.

Figure 4(b) plots the accuracy on adversarially perturbed versions of the first 1000 images of the MNIST test set as a function of  $\beta$ . Each point in the plot corresponds to 3 separate executions of three different models trained with the same value of  $\beta$ . All models tested achieve over  $98.4\%$  accuracy on the unperturbed MNIST test set, so there is no appreciable measurement distortion due to underlying model accuracy.

We try both untargeted and targeted attacks. For targeting, we generate a random target label different from the source label in order to avoid biasing the results with unevenly explored source/target pairs. We see that for a reasonably broad range of  $\beta$  values, the VIB models have significantly better accuracy on the perturbed test set than the deterministic models, which have an accuracy of  $0\%$  (the attack of Carlini & Wagner (2016) is very effective on traditional model architectures).

Figure 4(b) also reveals a surprising level of adversarial robustness even when  $\beta \rightarrow 0$ . This can be explained by the theoretical framework of Fawzi et al. (2016). Their work proves that quadratic classifiers (e.g.,  $x^{\mathsf{T}}Ax$ , symmetric  $A$ ) have a greater capacity for adversarial robustness than linear classifiers. As we show in Appendix B, our Gaussian/softmax encoder/decoder is approximately quadratic for all  $\beta < \infty$ .

# 5 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

There are many possible directions for future work, including: testing on real images; using richer parametric marginal approximations, rather than assuming  $r(z) = \mathcal{N}(0,I)$ ; exploring the connections to differential privacy (see e.g., Wang et al. (2016); Cuff & Yu (2016)); and investigating open universe classification problems (see e.g., Bendale & Boult (2015)). In addition, we would like to explore applications to sequence prediction, where  $X$  denotes the past of the sequence and  $Y$  the future, while  $Z$  is the current representation of the network. This form of the information bottleneck is known as predictive information (Bialek et al., 2001; Palmer et al., 2015).

(We normalize all values by the corresponding norm of the perturbation against the base model.)

The blue line is for targeted attacks, and the green line is for untargeted attacks (which are easier to resist). In this case,  $\beta = 10^{-11}$  has performance indistinguishable from  $\beta = 0$ . The deterministic model has a classification accuracy of  $0\%$  in both the targeted and untargeted attack scenarios, indicated by the horizontal red dashed line at the bottom of the plot.
