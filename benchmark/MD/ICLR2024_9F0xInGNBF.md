# ABSTRACT

Vision-language models (VLMs) classify the query video by calculating a similarity score between the visual features and text-based class label representations. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to enrich the text-based class labels by enhancing the descriptiveness of the class names. However, these improvements are restricted to the text-based classifier only, and the query visual features are not considered. In this paper, we propose a framework which combines pre-trained discriminative VLMs with pre-trained generative video-to-text and text-to-text models. We introduce two key modifications to the standard zero-shot setting. First, we propose language-guided visual feature enhancement and employ a video-to-text model to convert the query video to its descriptive form. The resulting descriptions contain vital visual cues of the query video, such as what objects are present and their spatio-temporal interactions. These descriptive cues provide additional semantic knowledge to VLMs to enhance their zero-shot performance. Second, we propose class-specific prompts to LLMs to generate more meaningful descriptions to enrich class label representations. Specifically, we introduce prompt techniques to create a Tree Hierarchy of Categories for class names, offering a higher-level action context for additional visual cues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in video understanding across three different zero-shot settings: 1) video action recognition, 2) video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval, and 3) time-sensitive video tasks. Consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks and with various VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our code will be made publicly available.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Open-vocabulary models (Roth et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021) have demonstrated impressive performance in downstream tasks. These models undergo contrastive training on large amounts of image-text pairs, aligning their embeddings in a shared space. However, extending these models to video tasks poses significant challenges mainly for two reasons: (1) due to large computational expenses, and (2) the requirement of gathering large-scale video-text pairs. Therefore, it is critical to effectively leverage pre-trained image-language models for video tasks without affecting their zero-shot capabilities.

To extend pre-trained image-language models to videos, there are two dominant approaches. The first approach takes inspiration from the prompt learning methods (Zhou et al., 2022c;b; Jia et al., 2022) and introduces learnable prompts or adapters to text, vision, or both sides (Yang et al., 2023; Wasim et al., 2023). In contrast, the second approach fine-tunes the whole pre-trained image-language model for video tasks (Rasheed et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021; Ni et al., 2022). The aforementioned approaches have several drawbacks, e.g., the introduction of additional learnable parameters that add to overall model complexity or require extensive fine-tuning to adapt the model for video tasks. Further, these methods require access to the true distribution of the target task, which can be prohibitive in test-time adaptation and data-scarce environments.

Recently, a new line of work has emerged (Menon & Vondrick, 2022; Pratt et al., 2022; Novack et al., 2023; Roth et al., 2023) that incorporates large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 to provide additional semantic context to existing vision-language models (VLMs) and requires no further training. These methods query LLMs to replace class names with enriched language descriptors in

GPT is used to enhance the descriptiveness of the class-names.

order to increase class descriptiveness. However, these studies have primarily focused on modifying the text-based classifier only, we propose a twofold improvement approach, simultaneously refining class representations and enriching visual features. Moreover, despite their promising results in image classification, the applicability of these method in the context of video understanding remains an open question, and our work aims to address this gap.

We present a framework called VideoPrompter that aims to enhance the test-time zero-shot performance of the existing VLMs for video understanding and introduce two modifications to the standard zero-shot framework. First, we query a video-to-text generative model to convert the input video to language representation, as this generated representation contains vital visual cues (such as what objects are present and how they interact spatially and temporally), which in turn helps the VLMs to better understand the given video. For instance, for a video shown in Figure 1 (c), the video-to-text model can provide detailed textual description e.g., "in this video, a woman is seen applying mascara using a makeup brush". As humans, we can effortlessly leverage such descriptive information and form a visual image of the video's content in our minds. Second, to enrich the class representations of the text classifier, we query LLM with class-specific prompts and generate two types of

To summarize, we make the following contributions:

1. We introduce a framework that is an ensemble of video-to-text and text-to-text generative models to increase the zero-shot performance of existing VLMs for video understanding.  
2. We introduce class-specific prompts to enrich the classifier representations and also propose a novel way to generate high-level action contexts from the dataset.  
3. Our framework offers a plug-and-play module adaptable to various existing VLMs such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), ViFi-CLIP (Rasheed et al., 2023), Action-CLIP (Wang et al., 2021), and AIM (Yang et al., 2023).  
4. We demonstrate results on three different video settings namely: action recognition, video-to-text, and text-to-video retrieval, and time-aware video tasks, and show results and ablation on 7 different datasets.

# 2.1 OVERVIEW

Let  $\mathbf{x}$  denote the query video and  $C$  denote the target categories. Let  $f_V$  and  $f_T$  respectively be the visual and text encoders of a VLM such as CLIP. The zero-shot video classification can be defined as nearest neighbor retrieval as follows:

$$
\tilde {c} = \underset {c \in C} {\arg \max } \cos \left(\boldsymbol {f} _ {V} (\boldsymbol {x}), \boldsymbol {f} _ {T} (\boldsymbol {p} (c))\right), \tag {1}
$$

with prompt  $p(c) = A$  photo of a  $\{c\}$ ,  $cos$  represents cosine similarity between visual and textual features.

The overall framework of VideoPrompter is presented in Figure 1 (c). The input query video  $\mathbf{x}$  is passed through a video-to-text conversational model, referred to here as  $\mathbf{F}_{\Theta}$  to generate corresponding video textual description. This video textual description is then processed by the VLM text encoder,  $\mathbf{f}_T$ , and fused together with the video features to get the enriched visual features  $\tilde{\mathbf{f}}_V$ . On the classifier-side, an LLM model, denoted by  $\mathbf{F}_{\phi}$ , converts the target categories  $C$  to corresponding language attributes and descriptions. These class label descriptions are then processed by the VLM text encoder,  $\mathbf{f}_T$ , to enhance class label features,  $\tilde{\mathbf{f}}_T$ . Our proposed zero-shot classification can then be defined as follows:

$$
\tilde {c} = \underset {c \in C} {\arg \max } \cos \left(\tilde {f} _ {V}, \tilde {f} _ {T} \mid_ {c}\right). \tag {2}
$$

In the following sections, we examine how the visual features  $\tilde{f}_V$  and the enriched class representations  $\tilde{f}_T$  are derived. For clarity, the descriptions generated by the video-to-text model (Maaz et al., 2023) are referred to as video textual descriptions. On the other hand, attributes and descriptions generated by LLM (Brown et al., 2020) are called language attributes and language descriptions.

# 2.2VIDEO-TO-TEXT GUIDED VISUAL FEATURE ENHANCEMENT

Given a video-language model, we aim to enhance its zero-shot performance by employing a video-to-text conversational model, i.e., Video-ChatGPT (VGPT) (Maaz et al., 2023), to analyze the video content. We prompt VGPT as "describe the activity in the video". VGPT leverages its spatiotemporal alignment between BLIP (Li et al., 2022) and an LLM (Chiang et al., 2023) to capture temporal dynamics and frame-to-frame consistency relationships, allowing it to generate coherent video textual descriptions of the events unfolding in the video. These video textual descriptions embed vital spatial and temporal information about the video events. The generated video textual descriptions are passed through the VLM text encoder  $f_{T}$  to generate a video description-level embedding.

Since the VLMs share a common image-text embedding space due to their contrastive learning objective (Radford et al., 2021), we found a simple weighted average of the video embedding and video textual description embedding to be efficient, as shown by fusion in Figure 1 (c). The enhanced visual embedding  $\tilde{f}_V$  is given as:

$$
\tilde {\boldsymbol {f}} _ {V} = \beta_ {1} \cdot \boldsymbol {f} _ {V} (\boldsymbol {x}) + \beta_ {2} \cdot \boldsymbol {f} _ {T} \left(\boldsymbol {F} _ {\Theta} (x)\right), \tag {3}
$$

where  $\beta_{1\sim 2}$  denotes the weights for the query video and video textual description embeddings, respectively.

# 2.3 TEXT-TO-TEXT GUIDED CLASSIFIER REFINEMENT

In our approach, we leverage an LLM, (Brown et al., 2020) and generate class-specific language descriptors. We found that class-specific descriptors can better adapt to the action-recognition datasets, and unlike (Pratt et al., 2022), only a small number of descriptors are required. For example, our framework only requires three descriptors, unlike 50 for (Pratt et al., 2022) in the case of the UCF-101 dataset (Soomro et al., 2012) 3.1.4. Furthermore, we arrange video action datasets in high-level

![](images/fb910b8995c98612b60ccd5462d1459f9e3b04772e5410d3d423337abd5b8c62.jpg)  
Figure 2: VideoPrompter's Interpretability. We divide our proposed attributes (section 2.3) and get the cosine similarity between the individual attribute and query video to find the contribution of each attribute. For example, the top row shows the prediction of our VideoPrompter is "golf" and the reason the model made this decision is because of golf-course in the background, golf-ball in the scene, and swing of the golf-stick. Similarly, the bottom row shows the upside down position played a vital role in the model to make the decision that it's a "handstand" action.

action contexts. For instance, all sports-related actions (basketball, cricket, baseball) can be added under one high-level action context, i.e., "playing sports". We propose to employ LLM to exploit this property of action-recognition datasets and generate high-level action context to provide additional cues to the classifier. In summary, we extract class-specific language descriptions (Sec. 2.3) from an LLM with high-level action context (Sec. 2.3.2).

# 2.3.1 CLASS-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE DESCRIPTORS

For action recognition, we propose to leverage an LLM, which is GPT-3.5 in our case (Brown et al., 2020) to take a class name as input and generate two types of class-specific language descriptors:

1. Language Attributes offer object-level visual cues to encourage the classifier to employ these features instead of just the class names. For instance, for the video action of "baby-crawling" the generated language attributes are: baby, crawling, hand, knees. We prompt GPT-3.5 as:

Q: What are the distinct visual characteristics to identify a {class-name} video action?  
2. Language Descriptions describe how a specific action is performed. It includes step-by-step directions for that action to facilitate the model's comprehension of the temporal context. For instance, for the video action of "baby-crawling" the generated language description is: a baby is seen on all fours, using their arms and knees to move across the floor. They alternate their arms and legs in a crawling motion, exploring their surroundings with curiosity. We prompt GPT-3.5 as:  
Q: How {class-name} action is performed visually?

The text encoder  $\pmb{f}_T$  extracts the embeddings of such generated language attributes and language descriptions. The modified class label representation  $\tilde{\pmb{f}}_T$  is the average of the embeddings of language attributes and language descriptions.

In problem setting of video-to-text or text-to-video retrieval, each video is paired with a corresponding caption. We employ GPT-3.5 to take the input caption and generate informative and semantically similar captions. For instance, for an input caption, "man is giving a review on a vehicle", the generated caption is "a person provides feedback on a car". Similarly, for an input caption "baseball player hits ball", the generated caption is "the ball is hit by a player in a baseball game". We prompt GPT-3.5 as:

<table><tr><td>Dataset</td><td>High-Level Action-Context</td></tr><tr><td>HMDB-51</td><td>self-grooming, physical activities, sports, eating, social interactions, artistic activities, other</td></tr><tr><td>UCF-101</td><td>self-grooming, playing music, playing sports, exercise and fitness, water activities, household chores, creative activities, other</td></tr><tr><td>K400</td><td>self-grooming, playing music, playing sports, exercise and fitness, household chores, social interactions, creative activities, transportation activities, water activities, other</td></tr></table>

Q: Given a caption: {input caption}, generate a visually similar captions.

The text encoder  $f_{T}$  extracts the embeddings of the generated captions. The modified class label representation  $\tilde{f}_{T}$  is the average of the embeddings of the original and generated captions.

# 2.3.2 INTEGRATING HIGH-LEVELVIDEO ACTION CONTEXT

We proposed a novel way of querying LLMs and divide the dataset into various high-level action contexts such that all video-action classes semantically close to each other are grouped under one high-level action context. We prompt - GPT-3.5 as:

Q: Divide the list of {class-names} into parent and child classes. Such that actions that are visually similar to each other are in the same group. If the action is not similar to any other action in the list, assign it to others.

As a result, this converts the standard input prompt (a photo of a {class-name}) to high-level action context prompt: a photo of a {high-level context} i.e. {class-name}. For instance, for the video action of "drumming", the prompt becomes "a photo of a playing music i.e., drumming". The text encoder  $f_{T}$  extracts the embeddings of the generated high-level action context prompt, which can be averaged with the embeddings of the language attributes and descriptions to create a context-based classifier. A summary of high-level action context for the different datasets is provided in Table 1, while the comprehensive list of Tree Hierarchy of Categories is provided in the Appendix B C, D.

# 3 EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOLS

We evaluate the effectiveness of VideoPrompter under three different video zero-shot settings: a) action recognition, b) text-to-video and video-to-text retrieval, and c) time-sensitive video tasks (Bagad et al., 2023). Additionally, we demonstrate that our VideoPrompter provides interpretability of the model decisions (Figure. 2). We use the ViT-B/16 backbone and sparsely sample 32 frames as consecutive frames are highly redundant with single-view evaluation (Rasheed et al., 2023). In the case of CLIP, the video embedding is obtained by averaging the frame-level embeddings, (Portillo-Quintero et al., 2021; Rasheed et al., 2023), while for other methods we follow their default settings. The video-adapted models (Rasheed et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023) are pre-trained on the K400 dataset (Kay et al., 2017).

We use three video textual descriptions from VGPT and only two language descriptors: language attributes and descriptions. To make sure that all three video textual descriptions generated by VGPT are diverse, we set its temperature (likelihood of selecting lower probability tokens) to 0.5., while for GPT-3.5, as we only prompt the model once for each descriptor, we set its temperature to 0.2 to generate more focused and deterministic descriptors. The video textual descriptions generated by VGPT are trimmed to be consistent within the context length of the text encoder (Radford et al., 2021), and we also apply CLIP-based filtering as a pre-processing step, discussed in 3.1.2 to remove erroneous video textual descriptions. We set  $\beta_{1}$  equal to 1.0, and  $\beta_{2}$  is calculated as cosine-similarity between the embeddings of query video and its video textual description. This ensures that a video textual description that is consistent with the query video is given higher weight. As AIM (Yang

Video Action Recognition. Our VideoPrompter achieves consistent improvements across various models and benchmarks, as shown in Table 2. We observe that when CLIP is incorporated within our framework, it performs on par with the fully-finetuned methods like ViFi-CLIP and ActionCLIP and outperforms adapter-based method AIM. Effectiveness of High-Level Action Context in Video Action Recognition: We observe that for datasets like UCF-101 (Soomro et al., 2012), HMDB-51 (Kuehne et al., 2011) and K400 (Kay et al., 2017), having diverse contexts, our proposed method finds effective and natural high-level action contexts and boost the performance across all methods, shown in Table 6. However, for datasets like SSv2 (Goyal et al., 2017), where class names highly correlate to each other such as letting something roll along a flat surface and letting something roll down a slanted surface, we found GPT-3.5 divides all of the actions in one class "manipulating objects" and we observed no improvement with high-level action context.

Text-to-Video and Video-to-Text Retrieval. We present recall at a rank  $(\mathbb{R}@\mathbb{K},$  where  $\mathrm{k} = 1,5)$  on  $1\mathrm{k}$  -A split-set of the MSR-VTT (Xu et al., 2016) dataset with the CLIP model. In the retrieval setting, for each video, we obtain 10 video textual descriptions using VGPT, and, for every caption we generate two more semantically similar but informative captions using GPT-3.5. As shown in Table 3 , our method consistently increases the performance.

Time-Sensitive Video Tasks. Bagad et al. (2023) discussed time awareness in video models and showed that the recent VLMs struggle to understand simple temporal relations such as before and after. To show that our VideoPrompter can increase the time-awareness of the existing VLMs, we report the time-consistency score on the before/after synthetic dataset (details of the dataset provided in Appendix A) (Bagad et al., 2023) and time-aware setting of Charades dataset (Sigurdsson et al., 2016). For each query video, we obtain 10 video textual descriptions using VGPT. In a time-aware setting, considering the nature of the problem, language attributes and descriptions are not used. Our framework enhances the performance on both benchmarks (Table 4). We obtain a substantial gain of  $10\%$ , even without using the language attributes and descriptions, which shows that our framework can provide additional cues to the VLMs to understand temporal relations.

# 3.1 UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OFVIDEOPROMPTER

In this section, we study different components of our framework. We use the CLIP model with ViT-B/16 visual encoder in all our ablations.

# 3.1.1 DESIGN CHOICES

To study the design effectiveness of our framework, we discuss various other design choices. First, to show that a combination of query video and its video textual description embedding is the optimal choice, we remove the visual encoder and only take the similarity of the video textual description embedding with the class representations, as shown in Figure 3 (left). We observe that both modalities (visual information and corresponding descriptive information) complement each other and removing visual embedding leads to sub-optimal results.

Further, we also study the impact of removing either the video-to-text model (VGPT) or the text-to-text model (GPT-3.5), as shown in Figure 4. While employing these modules individually results in improved performance across all four benchmarks, their combination exhibits a complementary relationship delivering the most optimal performance.

We also examined the possibility of predicting class names directly by providing GPT-3.5 with video textual descriptions and instructing it to select the closest matching class from a predefined list, we found that this approach fell short of producing optimal results.

# 3.1.2 FILTERING OF VIDEO TEXTUAL DESCRIPTIONS

We apply CLIP-based filtering as a pre-processing step to remove erroneous visual textual descriptions. Specifically, we generate 10 visual textual descriptions for each query video and extract corresponding textual embeddings along with the visual embedding of the query video. Cosine similarity between these embeddings is taken to filter the top-3 visual textual descriptions. As shown in Figure 3 (middle), filtering of visual textual descriptions further increases the performance of our framework. We only apply filtering in the action-recognition setting.

# 3.1.3 IMPACT OF VISUAL TEXTUAL DESCRIPTION DIVERSITY

In order to analyze how the diversity of visual textual descriptions impacts our framework, we experimented with two varying temperature settings (0.2 and 0.5). These temperature settings directly influence the probability of selecting less common tokens, thereby increasing the diversity of the

generated descriptions. As shown in Figure 3 (right), the higher temperature setting leads to better results (as it generates more diverse descriptions). Here, VGPT only indicate that only video textual descriptions are used, while language attributes and descriptions are not employed.

# 3.1.4 COMPARISON WITH CUPL

We compare our work with one of the recent works CUPL (Pratt et al., 2022) and show that only a handful of carefully designed video prompts combined with the video-to-text guided visual feature enhancement module leads to superior performance. CUPL employs GPT-3 and designs multiple dataset-specific prompts to generate the language descriptions. For instance, for UCF-101, (Pratt et al., 2022) design 5 prompts and generate 10 responses for each prompt leading to 50 descriptions in total. As shown in Table 5, our framework obtains superior performance with only 3 language descriptors i.e. language attributes, language descriptions, and high-level action context. Further, recent work (Roth et al., 2023) found descriptor ensemble as the main driver for performance in the case of a large number of prompts and showed comparable performance with randomized descriptors. This further validates our work that only a few carefully designed video prompts are enough to enrich the class representations.

# 4 LITERATURE REVIEW

Vision-Language Models. VLMs (Radford et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2021) have shown impressive generalization capabilities on various downstream tasks including open-vocabulary image recognition (Zhang et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022c;b), object detection (Gu et al., 2021; Rao et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022d) and image segmentation (Ding et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022a). However, the extension of these models to video-related tasks poses significant challenges, primarily due to the substantial computational costs and the requirement to collect large-scale video-text pairs. Therefore, various methods have been proposed to effectively leverage pre-trained image-language models for video tasks (Rasheed et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023; Wasim et al., 2023). Nevertheless, these approaches either introduce additional learnable parameters that add to overall model complexity or require extensive fine-tuning to adapt the model for video tasks. Further, these methods require access to the true distribution of the target task, which can be prohibitive in test-time adaptation and data-scarce environments.

Improving Text Classifier Representations Using LLMs. As open-vocabulary models classify the input by calculating a similarity score between the image/video and textual prompt (a photo of a {class-name}.) for each class, this makes the models' performance directly dependent on the descriptiveness of the class names. Recently, a new line of work has emerged (Menon & Vondrick, 2022; Pratt et al., 2022; Roth et al., 2023; Novack et al., 2023) that incorporates LLMs to enrich these class names and requires no further training or access to the true distribution of the target task. (Menon & Vondrick, 2022) highlights that language can provide additional context to the classifier, and LLM is employed to describe visual features that distinguish that object in an image. (Pratt et al., 2022) further explores this idea and uses LLM to generate multiple descriptors for each class name in the dataset. For instance, for UCF-101, (Pratt et al., 2022) designed 5 prompts and generated 10 responses for each prompt leading to 50 descriptions in total. Despite the promising results in image classification, the applicability of these methods (Menon & Vondrick, 2022; Pratt et al., 2022; Roth et al., 2023; Novack et al., 2023) in the context of video understanding remains an open question, and our work aims to address this gap. Moreover, as these methods make use of LLMs to increase the descriptiveness of the class names, the visual side of the VLMs remains unaltered. Our framework - VideoPrompter - simultaneously refines class representations and enriches visual features, utilizing text-to-text (Brown et al., 2020) and video-to-text models (Maaz et al., 2023) respectively. We do so in a two-step approach: first, we query a video-to-text generative model to convert the input video to language representation (description) and fuse it with the query video embedding to enhance the overall visual representation. Second, we use class-specific prompts to query LLM and generate language descriptors to enrich the class representations.

Context-based Classifier Enhancement. (Roth et al., 2023; Novack et al., 2023) showed that furnishing contextual information to the VLM can significantly aid the model in directing its attention to relevant features and help resolve class ambiguities. (Roth et al., 2023) employed LLM to find the higher-level commonalities in the dataset and GPT-3 is used to extract common context from the datasets. For instance, in CUB200-2011, a bird-related dataset,(Roth et al., 2023) generates the context "bird." Likewise, in the eurosat dataset of satellite images, (Roth et al., 2023) outputs the context "land use". However, video-action recognition datasets (Kay et al., 2017; Kuehne et al., 2011; Soomro et al., 2012) generally comprise actions with diverse contexts. For example, the UCF-101 dataset can be subdivided into the following high-level contexts: self-grooming, playing music, playing sports, exercise and fitness, water activities, household chores, and other activities, therefore, (Roth et al., 2023) cannot be directly applied to such diverse datasets. Recently, (Novack et al., 2023) proposed a sub-division of the classes to one level lower, i.e., fine-grained classes. However, their method is only applicable to datasets (unlike action recognition) where the classes are not fine-grained. We proposed an alternative way of querying LLMs and divide the dataset into various high-level action contexts such that all video-action classes semantically close to each other are grouped under one high-level action context. For instance, all sports-related actions (basketball, cricket, baseball) can be added under one high-level action context, i.e., "playing sports". This high-level action context provides additional cues to further enrich the class representations.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this work, we introduced a framework - VideoPrompter - to boost the zero-shot performance of existing VLMs for video understanding. We present a systematic way to prompt pre-trained generative video-to-text and text-to-text models to provide additional semantic context to enrich visual and class representations simultaneously. We demonstrate that, without further training, VideoPrompter performs on par with the various existing fully fine-tuned methods and outperforms adapter-based methods. We also discuss various design choices and demonstrate that both video-to-text and text-to-text models complement each other and result in optimal performance. We also introduce a Tree Hierarchy of Categories for class names, offering a higher-level action context for additional visual cues. VideoPrompter achieved consistent improvement across three different zero-shot settings: video action recognition, video-to-text, text-to-video retrieval, and time-sensitive video tasks across multiple benchmarks and models.
