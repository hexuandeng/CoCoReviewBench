# ABSTRACT

The ability to detect objects regardless of image corruptions or weather conditions is crucial for real-world applications of deep learning like autonomous driving. We here provide an easy-to-use benchmark to assess how object detection models perform when image quality degrades. The three resulting benchmark datasets, termed PASCAL-C, COCO-C and Cityscapes-C, contain a large variety of image corruptions. We show that a range of standard object detection models suffer a severe performance loss on corrupted images (down to  $30 - 60\%$  of the original performance). However, a simple data augmentation trick—stylizing the training images—leads to a substantial increase in robustness across corruption type, severity and dataset. We envision our comprehensive benchmark to track future progress towards building robust object detection models. Benchmark, code and data are available at https://....

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A day in the near future: Autonomous vehicles are swarming the streets all over the world, tirelessly collecting data. But on this cold November afternoon traffic comes to an abrupt halt as it suddenly begins to snow: winter is coming. Huge snowflakes are falling from the sky and the cameras of autonomous vehicles are no longer able to make sense of their surroundings, triggering immediate emergency brakes. A day later, an investigation of this traffic disaster reveals that the unexpectedly large size of the snowflakes was the cause of the chaos: While state-of-the-art vision systems had been trained on a variety of common weather types, their training data contained hardly any snowflakes of this size...

This fictional example highlights the problems that arise when Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) encounter settings that were not explicitly part of their training regime. For example, state-of-the-art object detection algorithms such as Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015) fail to recognize objects when snow is added to an image (as shown in Figure 1), even though the objects are still clearly visible to a human eye. At the same time, augmenting the training data with several types

Figure 2: Expect the unexpected: To ensure safety, an autonomous vehicle must be able to recognize objects even in challenging outdoor conditions such as fog, frost, snow and, of course, the occasional dragonfire.

of distortions is not a sufficient solution to achieve general robustness against previously unknown corruptions: It has recently been demonstrated that CNNs generalize poorly to novel distortion types, despite being trained on a variety of other distortions (Geirhos et al., 2018). Even an innocuous distribution shift—such as a transition from small snowflakes at training time to large snowflakes at test time—can have a strong impact on current vision systems.

On a more general level, CNNs often fail to generalize outside of the training domain or training data distribution. Examples include the failure to generalize to images with uncommon poses of objects (Alcorn et al., 2019) or to cope with small distributional changes (e.g. Zech et al., 2018; Touvron et al., 2019). One of the most extreme cases are adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2013): images with a domain shift so small that it is imperceptible for humans yet sufficient to fool a DNN. We here focus on the less extreme but far more common problem of perceptible image distortions like blurry images, noise or natural distortions like snow.

As an example, autonomous vehicles need to be able to cope with wildly varying outdoor conditions such as fog, frost, snow, sand storms, or falling leaves, just to name a few (as visualized in Figure 2). One of the major reasons why autonomous cars have not yet gone mainstream is the inability of their recognition models to function well in adverse weather conditions (Dai & Van Gool, 2018). Many common environmental conditions can (and have been) modelled, including fog (Sakaridis et al., 2018b), rain (Hospach et al., 2016), snow (Bernuth et al., 2019) and daytime to nighttime transitions (Dai & Van Gool, 2018). However it is impossible to foresee all potential conditions that might occur "in the wild".

If we could build models that are robust to every possible image corruption, weather changes would not be an issue. However, in order to assess the robustness of models one first needs to define a measure. While testing models on the set of all possible corruption types is impossible, we argue that a useful approximation is to evaluate models on a diverse range of corruption types that were not part of the training data: if a model copes well with a dozen corruptions that it has never seen before, we expect it to cope well with yet another type of corruption.

In this work, we propose three easy-to-use benchmark datasets termed PASCAL-C, COCO-C and Cityscapes-C to assess distortion robustness in object detection. Each dataset contains versions of the original object detection dataset which are corrupted with 15 distortions, each spanning five levels of severity. This approach follows Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019), who introduced corrupted versions of commonly used classification datasets (ImageNet-C, CIFAR10-C) as standardized benchmarks. After evaluating standard object detection algorithms on these benchmark datasets, we show how a simple data augmentation technique—stylizing the training images—can strongly improve robustness across corruption type, severity and dataset.

# 1.2 RELATED WORK

**Benchmarking corruption robustness** Several studies investigate the vulnerability of CNNs to common corruptions. Dodge & Karam (2016) measure the performance of four state-of-the-art image recognition models on out-of-distribution data and show that CNNs are in particular vulnerable to blur and Gaussian noise. Geirhos et al. (2018) show that CNN performance drops much faster than human performance for the task of recognizing corrupted images when the perturbation level increases across a broad range of corruption types. Azulay & Weiss (2018) investigate the lack of invariance of several state-of-the-art CNNs to small translations. A benchmark to evaluate the robustness of recognition models against common corruptions was recently introduced by Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019).

Improving corruption robustness One way to restore the performance drop on corrupted data is to preprocess the data in order to remove the corruption. Mukherjee et al. (2018) propose a DNN-based approach to restore image quality of rainy and foggy images. Bahnsen & Moeslund (2018) and Bahnsen et al. (2019) propose algorithms to remove rain from images as a preprocessing step and report a subsequent increase in recognition rate. A challenge for these approaches is that noise removal is currently specific to a certain distortion type and thus does not generalize to other types of distortions. Another line of work seeks to enhance the classifier performance by the means of data augmentation, i.e. by directly including corrupted data into the training. Vasiljevic et al. (2016) study the vulnerability of a classifier to blurred images and enhance the performance on blurred images by fine-tuning on them. Geirhos et al. (2018) examine the generalization between different corruption types and find that fine-tuning on one corruption type does not enhance performance on other corruption types. In a different study, Geirhos et al. (2019) train a recognition model on a stylized version of the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015), reporting increased general robustness against different corruptions as a result of a stronger bias towards ignoring textures and focusing on object shape. Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019) report several methods leading to enhanced performance on their corruption benchmark: Histogram Equalization, Multiscale Networks, Adversarial Logit Pairing, Feature Aggregating and Larger Networks.

Evaluating robustness to environmental changes in autonomous driving In recent years, weather conditions turned out to be a central limitation for state-of-the-art autonomous driving systems (Sakaridis et al., 2018b; Volk et al., 2019; Dai & Van Gool, 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018). While many specific approaches like modelling weather conditions (Sakaridis et al., 2018b;a; Volk et al., 2019; Bernuth et al., 2019; Hospach et al., 2016; Bernuth et al., 2018) or collecting real (Wen et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2018; Che et al., 2019; Caesar et al., 2019) and artificial (Gaidon et al., 2016; Ros et al., 2016; Richter et al., 2017; Johnson-Roberson et al., 2017) datasets with varying weather conditions, no general solution towards the problem has yet emerged. Radecki et al. (2016) experimentally test the performance of various sensors and object recognition and classification models in adverse weather and lighting conditions. Bernuth et al. (2018) report a drop in the performance of a Recurrent Rolling Convolution network trained on the KITTI dataset when the camera images are modified by simulated raindrops on the windshield. Pei et al. (2017) introduce VeriVis, a framework to evaluate the security and robustness of different object recognition models using real-world image corruptions such as brightness, contrast, rotations, smoothing, blurring and others. Machiraju & Channappayya (2018) propose a metric to evaluate the degradation of object detection performance of an autonomous vehicle in several adverse weather conditions evaluated on

the Virtual KITTI dataset. Building upon Hospach et al. (2016), Volk et al. (2019) study the fragility of an object detection model against rainy images, identify corner cases where the model fails and include images with synthetic rain variations into the training set. They report enhanced performance on real rain images. Bernuth et al. (2019) model photo-realistic snow and fog conditions to a augment real and virtual video streams. They report a significant performance drop of an object detection model when evaluated on corrupted data.

# 2 METHODS

# 2.1 ROBUST DETECTION BENCHMARK

We introduce the Robust Detection Benchmark inspired by the ImageNet-C benchmark for object classification (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) to assess object detection robustness on corrupted images.

Corruption types Following Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019), we provide 15 corruptions on five severity levels each (visualized in Figure 3) to assess the effect of a broad range of different corruption types on object detection models. The corruptions are sorted into four groups: noise, blur, digital and weather groups (as defined by Hendrycks & Dietterich (2019)). It is important to note that the corruption types are not meant to be used as a training data augmentation toolbox, but rather to measure a model's robustness against previously unseen corruptions. Thus, training should be done without using any of the provided corruptions. For model validation, four separate corruptions are provided (Speckle Noise, Gaussian Blur, Spatter, Saturate). The 15 corruptions described above should only be used to test the final model performance.

Benchmark datasets The Robust Detection Benchmark consists of three benchmark datasets: PASCAL-C, COCO-C and Cityscapes-C. Among the vast number of available object detection datasets (Everingham et al., 2010; Geiger et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2014; Cordts et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017; Neuhold et al., 2017; Krasin et al., 2017), we chose to use PASCAL VOC (Everingham et al., 2010), MS COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and Cityscapes (Cordts et al., 2016) as they are the most commonly used datasets for general object detection (PASCAL & COCO) and street scenes (Cityscapes). We follow common conventions to select the tests splits: VOC2007 test set

![](images/cb07b00dd28be5bb1c5b3101d5a862a7837f8e8a4b2104ff5fb91278b9787bad.jpg)

for PASCAL-C, the COCO 2017 validation set for COCO-C and the Cityscapes validation set for Cityscapes-C.

Metrics Since performance measures differ between the original datasets, the dataset-specific performance (P) measures are adopted as defined below:

$$
P := \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} A P ^ {5 0} (\%) & \text {P A S C A L V O C} \\ A P (\%) & M S C O C O \& \text {C i t y s c a p e s} \end{array} \right.
$$

where  $\mathrm{AP^{50}}$  stands for the PASCAL 'Average Precision' metric at  $50\%$  Intersection over Union (IoU) and AP stands for the COCO 'Average Precision' metric which averages over IoUs between  $50\%$  and  $95\%$ . On the corrupted data, the benchmark performance is measured in terms of mean performance under corruption (mPC):

$$
\mathrm {m P C} = \frac {1}{\mathrm {N} _ {c}} \sum_ {c = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N} _ {c}} \frac {1}{\mathrm {N} _ {s}} \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N} _ {s}} \mathrm {P} _ {c, s} \tag {1}
$$

Here,  $\mathrm{P}_{c,s}$  is the dataset-specific performance measure evaluated on test data corrupted with corruption  $c$  under severity level  $s$  while  $\mathrm{N}_c = 15$  and  $\mathrm{N}_s = 5$  indicate the number of corruptions and severity levels, respectively. In order to measure relative performance degradation under corruption, the relative performance under corruption (rPC) is introduced as defined below:

$$
\mathrm {r P C} = \frac {\mathrm {m P C}}{\mathrm {P} _ {\text {c l e a n}}} \tag {2}
$$

rPC measures the relative degradation of performance on corrupted data compared to clean data.

Baseline models We provide baseline results for a set of common object detection models including Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015), Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017), Cascade R-CNN (Cai & Vasconcelos, 2018), Cascade Mask R-CNN (Chen et al., 2019a), RetinaNet (Lin et al., 2017b) and Hybrid Task Cascade (Chen et al., 2019a). We use a ResNet50 (He et al., 2016) with Feature Pyramid Networks (Lin et al., 2017a) as backbone for all models except for Faster R-CNN where we additionally test ResNet101 (He et al., 2016), ResNeXt101-32x4d (Xie et al., 2017) and ResNeXt-64x4d (Xie et al., 2017) backbones. We additionally provide results for Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN models with deformable convolutions (Dai et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018) in Appendix D. Models were evaluated using the mmdetection toolbox (Chen et al., 2019b); all models were trained and tested with standard hyperparameters. The details can be found in Appendix B.

# 2.2 STYLE TRANSFER AS DATA AUGMENTATION

For image classification, style transfer (Gatys et al., 2016)—the method of combining the content of an image with the style of another image—has been shown to strongly improve corruption robustness (Geirhos et al., 2019). We here transfer this method to object detection datasets testing two settings: (1) Replacing each training image with a stylized version and (2) adding a stylized version of each

# 3 RESULTS

# 3.1 IMAGE CORRUPTIONS REDUCE MODEL PERFORMANCE

In order to assess the effect of image corruptions, we evaluated a set of common object detection models on the three benchmark datasets defined in Section 2. Performance is heavily degraded on corrupted images (compare Table 1). While Faster R-CNN can retain roughly  $60\%$  relative performance (rPC) on the rather simple images in PASCAL VOC, the same model suffers a dramatic reduction to  $33\%$  rPC on the Cityscapes dataset, which contains many small objects. With some variations, this effect is present in all tested models and also holds for instance segmentation tasks (for instance segmentation results, please see Appendix D).

# 3.2 ROBUSTNESS INCREASES WITH BACKBONE CAPACITY

We test variants of Faster R-CNN with different backbones (top of Table 1) and different head architectures (bottom of Table 1) on COCO. For the models with different backbones, we find that all image corruptions—except for the blur types—induce a fixed penalty to model performance, independent of the baseline performance on clean data:  $\Delta \mathrm{mPC} \approx \Delta \mathrm{P}$  (compare Table 1 and Appendix Figure 10). Therefore, models with more powerful backbones show a relative performance improvement under corruption. $^6$  In comparison, Mask R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN and Cascade Mask R-CNN which draw their performance increase from more sophisticated head architectures all have roughly the same rPC of  $\approx 50\%$ . The current state-of-the-art model Hybrid Task Cascade (Chen

et al., 2019a) is in so far an exception as it employs a combination of a stronger backbone, improved head architecture and additional training data to not only outperform the strongest baseline model by  $9\%$  AP on clean data but distances itself on corrupted data by a similar margin, achieving a leading relative performance under corruption (rPC) of  $64.7\%$ . These results indicate that robustness in the tested regime can be improved primarily through a better image encoding, and better head architectures cannot extract more information if the primary encoding is already sufficiently impaired.

# 3.3 TRAINING ON STYLIZED DATA IMPROVES ROBUSTNESS

In order to reduce the strong effect of corruptions on model performance observed above, we tested whether a simple approach (stylizing the training data) leads to a robustness improvement. We evaluate the exact same model (Faster R-CNN) with three different training data schemes (visualized in Figure 4):

standard: the unmodified training data of the respective dataset

stylized: the training data is stylized completely

combined: concatenation of standard and stylized training data

The results across our three datasets PASCAL-C, COCO-C and Cityscapes-C are visualized in Figure 5. We observe a similar pattern as reported by Geirhos et al. (2019) for object classification on ImageNet—a model trained on stylized data suffers less from corruptions than the model trained only on the original clean data. However, its performance on clean data is much lower. Combining stylized and clean data seems to achieve the best of both worlds: high performance on clean data as well as strongly improved performance under corruption. From the results in Table 2, it can be seen that both stylized and combined training improve the relative performance under corruption (rPC). Combined training yields the highest absolute performance under corruption (mPC) for all three datasets. This pattern is fairly consistent. Detailed results across corruption types are reported in the Appendix (Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9).

# 3.4 PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION DOES NOT SIMPLY SCALE WITH PERTURBATION SIZE

We investigated whether there is a direct relationship between the impact of a corruption on the pixel values of an image and the impact of a corruption on model performance. Figure 6 shows the relative performance of Faster R-CNN on the corruptions in PASCAL-C dependent on the perturbation size measured in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It can be seen that there is no such simple relation. For instance, Impulse Noise alters only a few pixels but has a drastic impact on the performance of the model, while Brightness or Fog alter all pixel values but have a small impact on the model performance. However, some of the corruption groups have a much higher impact on model performance than others (e.g. digital corruptions have a stronger impact than blur corruptions).

Figure 6: Relative performance under corruption (rPC) as a function of corruption RMSE evaluated on PASCAL VOC. The dots indicate the rPC of Faster R-CNN trained on standard data; the arrows show the performance gained via training on 'combined' data. Corruptions are grouped into four corruption types: noise, blur, weather and digital.

# 4 DISCUSSION

We here showed that object detection and instance segmentation models suffer severe performance impairments on corrupted images. This drop in performance has previously been observed in image recognition models (e.g. Geirhos et al., 2018; Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019). In order to track future progress on this important issue, we propose the Robust Detection Benchmark containing three easy-to-use benchmark datasets PASCAL-C, COCO-C and Cityscapes-C. Apart from providing baselines, we demonstrate how a simple data augmentation technique, namely adding a stylized copy of the training data in order to reduce a model's focus on textural information, leads to strong robustness improvements. On corrupted images, we consistently observe a performance increase (about  $16\%$  for PASCAL,  $12\%$  for COCO, and  $41\%$  for Cityscapes) with small losses on clean data  $(0 - 2\%)$ . This approach has the benefit that it can be applied to any image dataset, requires no additional labelling or model tuning and, thus, comes basically for free. At the same time, our benchmark data shows that there is still space for improvement and it is yet to be determined whether the most promising robustness enhancement techniques will require architectural modifications, data augmentation schemes, modifications to the loss function, or a combination of these.

We encourage readers to expand the benchmark with novel corruption types. In order to achieve robust models, testing against a wide variety of different image corruptions is necessary—there is no 'too much'. Since our benchmark is open source, we welcome new corruption types and look forward to your pull requests to https://...!

We envision our comprehensive benchmark to track future progress towards building robust object detection models that can be reliably deployed in the wild, eventually enabling them to cope with unexpected weather changes, corruptions of all kinds and, if necessary, even the occasional dragonfire.
