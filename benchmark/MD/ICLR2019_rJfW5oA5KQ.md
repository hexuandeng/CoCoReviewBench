# ABSTRACT

While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have empirically produced impressive results on learning complex real-world distributions, recent works have shown that they suffer from lack of diversity or mode collapse. The theoretical work of Arora et al. (2017a) suggests a dilemma about GANs' statistical properties: powerful discriminators cause overfitting, whereas weak discriminators cannot detect mode collapse.

By contrast, we show in this paper that GANs can in principle learn distributions in Wasserstein distance (or KL-divergence in many cases) with polynomial sample complexity, if the discriminator class has strong distinguishing power against the particular generator class (instead of against all possible generators). For various generator classes such as mixture of Gaussians, exponential families, and invertible and injective neural networks generators, we design corresponding discriminators (which are often neural nets of specific architectures) such that the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) induced by the discriminators can provably approximate the Wasserstein distance and/or KL-divergence. This implies that if the training is successful, then the learned distribution is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance or KL divergence, and thus cannot drop modes. Our preliminary experiments show that on synthetic datasets the test IPM is well correlated with KL divergence or the Wasserstein distance, indicating that the lack of diversity in GANs may be caused by the sub-optimality in optimization instead of statistical inefficiency.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In the past few years, we have witnessed great empirical success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) in generating high-quality samples in many domains. Various ideas have been proposed to further improve the quality of the learned distributions and the stability of the training. (See e.g., (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Odena et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2016; Tolstikhin et al., 2017; Salimans et al., 2016; Jiwoong Im et al., 2016; Durugkar et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017) and the reference therein.)

However, understanding of GANs is still in its infancy. Do GANs actually learn the target distribution? Recent works (Arora et al., 2017a;b; Dumoulin et al., 2016) have both theoretically and empirically brought the concern to light that distributions learned by GANs suffer from mode collapse or lack of diversity — the learned distribution tend to miss a significant amount of modes of the target distribution. The main message of this paper is that the mode collapse can be in principle alleviated by designing proper discriminators with strong distinguishing power against specific families of generators (such as special subclasses of neural network generators.)

# 1.1 BACKGROUND ON MODE COLLAPSE IN GANS

We mostly focus on the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) formulation (Arjovsky et al., 2017) in this paper. Define the  $\mathcal{F}$ -Integral Probability Metric ( $\mathcal{F}$ -IPM) (Muller, 1997) between distributions  $p, q$  as

$$
W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) := \sup  _ {f \in \mathcal {F}} \left| \mathbb {E} _ {X \sim p} [ f (X) ] - \mathbb {E} _ {X \sim q} [ f (X) ] \right|. \tag {1}
$$

Given samples from distribution  $p$ , WGAN sets up a family of generators  $\mathcal{G}$ , a family of discriminators  $\mathcal{F}$ , and aims to learn the data distribution  $p$  by solving

$$
\min  _ {q \in \mathcal {G}} W _ {\mathcal {F}} \left(\hat {p} ^ {n}, \hat {q} ^ {m}\right) \tag {2}
$$

where  $\hat{p}^n$  denotes "the empirical version of the distribution  $p$ ", meaning the uniform distribution over a set of  $n$  i.i.d samples from  $p$  (and similarly  $\hat{q}^m$ .)

When  $\mathcal{F} = \{\text{all 1-Lipschitz functions}\}$ , IPM reduces to the Wasserstein-1 distance  $W_{1}$ . In practice, parametric families of functions  $\mathcal{F}$  such as multi-layer neural networks are used for approximating Lipschitz functions, so that we can empirically optimize this objective eq. (2) via gradient-based algorithms as long as distributions in the family  $\mathcal{G}$  have parameterized samplers. (See Section 2 for more details.)

One of the main theoretical and empirical concerns with GANs is the issue of "mode-collapse"(Arora et al., 2017a; Salimans et al., 2016) — the learned distribution  $q$  tends to generate high-quality but low-diversity examples. Mathematically, the problem apparently arises from the fact that IPM is weaker than  $W_{1}$ , and the mode-dropped distribution can fool the former (Arora et al., 2017a): for a typical distribution  $p$ , there exists a distribution  $q$  such that simultaneously the followings happen:

$$
W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \lesssim \varepsilon \text {a n d} W _ {1} (p, q) \gtrsim 1. \tag {3}
$$

where  $\lesssim, \gtrsim$  hide constant factors. In fact, setting  $q = \hat{p}^N$  with  $N = R(\mathcal{F}) / \varepsilon^2$ , where  $R(\mathcal{F})$  is a complexity measure of  $\mathcal{F}$  (such as Rademacher complexity),  $q$  satisfies eq. (3) but is clearly a mode-dropped version of  $p$  when  $p$  has an exponential number of modes.

Reasoning that the problem is with the strength of the discriminator, a natural solution is to increase it to larger families such as all 1-Lipschitz functions. However, Arora et al. (Arora et al., 2017a) points out that Wasserstein-1 distance doesn't have good generalization properties: the empirical Wasserstein distance used in the optimization is very far from the population distance. Even for a spherical Gaussian distribution  $p = \mathsf{N}(0,\frac{1}{d} I_{d\times d})$  (or many other typical distributions), when the distribution  $q$  is exactly equal to  $p$ , letting  $\hat{q}^m$  and  $\hat{p}^n$  be two empirical versions of  $q$  and  $p$  with  $m,n = \mathrm{poly}(d)$ , we have with high probability,

$$
W _ {1} \left(\hat {p} ^ {n}, \hat {q} ^ {m}\right) \gtrsim 1 \quad \text {e v e n t h o u g h} \quad W _ {1} (p, q) = 0. \tag {4}
$$

Therefore even when learning succeeds ( $p = q$ ), it cannot be gleaned from the empirical version of  $W_{1}$ .

The observations above pose a dilemma in establishing the statistical properties of GANs: powerful discriminators cause overfitting, whereas weak discriminators result in diversity issues because IPM doesn't approximate the Wasserstein distance. The lack of diversity has also been observed empirically by (Srivastava et al., 2017; Di & Yu, 2017; Borji, 2018; Arora et al., 2017b).

# 1.2 AN APPROACH TO DIVERSITY: DISCRIMINATOR FAMILIES WITH RESTRICTED APPROXIMABILITY

This paper proposes a resolution to the conundrum by designing a discriminator class  $\mathcal{F}$  that is particularly strong against a specific generator class  $\mathcal{G}$ . We say that a discriminator class  $\mathcal{F}$  (and its IPM  $W_{\mathcal{F}}$ ) has restricted approximability w.r.t. a generator class  $\mathcal{G}$ , if  $\mathcal{F}$  can distinguish any pairs of distributions  $p, q \in \mathcal{G}$  approximately as well as all 1-Lipschitz functions can do:

$W_{\mathcal{F}}$  has restricted approximability w.r.t.  $\mathcal{G}$

$$
\triangleq \forall p, q \in \mathcal {G}, \gamma_ {L} \left(W _ {1} (p, q)\right) \lesssim W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \lesssim \gamma_ {U} \left(W _ {1} (p, q)\right), \tag {5}
$$

where  $\gamma_L(\cdot)$  and  $\gamma_U(\cdot)$  are two monotone nonnegative functions with  $\gamma_L(0) = \gamma_U(0) = 0$ . The paper mostly focuses on  $\gamma_L(t) = t^\alpha$  with  $1 \leq \alpha \leq 2$  and  $\gamma_U(t) = t$ , although we use the term "restricted approximability" more generally for this type of result (without tying it to a concrete definition of  $\gamma$ ). In other words, we are looking for discriminators  $\mathcal{F}$  so that  $\mathcal{F}$ -IPM can approximate the Wasserstein distance  $W_1$  for pairs of distributions  $p, q \in \mathcal{G}$ .

A discriminator class  $\mathcal{F}$  with restricted approximability resolves the dilemma in the following way.

First,  $\mathcal{F}$  avoids mode collapse - if the IPM between  $p$  and  $q$  is small, then by the left hand side of eq. (5),  $p$  and  $q$  are also close in Wasserstein distance and therefore significant mode-dropping cannot happen.

Second, we can pass from population-level guarantees to empirical-level guarantees - as shown in Arora et al. (2017a), classical capacity bounds such as the Rademacher complexity of  $\mathcal{F}$  relate  $W_{\mathcal{F}}(p,q)$  to  $W_{\mathcal{F}}(\hat{p}^n,\hat{q}^m)$ . Therefore, as long as the capacity is bounded, we can expand on eq. (5) to get a full picture of the statistical properties of Wasserstein GANs:

$$
\forall p, q \in \mathcal {G}, \gamma_ {L} (W _ {1} (p, q)) \lesssim W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \approx W _ {\mathcal {F}} (\hat {p} ^ {n}, \hat {q} ^ {m}) \lesssim \gamma_ {U} (W _ {1} (p, q)).
$$

Here the first inequality addresses the diversity property of the distance  $W_{\mathcal{F}}$ , and the second approximation addresses the generalization of the distance, and the third inequality provides the reverse guarantee that if the training fails to find a solution with small IPM, then indeed  $p$  and  $q$  are far away in Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical framework that tackles the statistical theory of GANs with polynomial samples.

The main body of the paper will develop techniques for designing discriminator class  $\mathcal{F}$  with restricted approximability for several examples of generator classes including simple classes like mixtures of Gaussians, exponential families, and more complicated classes like distributions generated by invertible neural networks. In the next subsection, we will show that properly chosen  $\mathcal{F}$  provides diversity guarantees such as inequalities eq. (5).

# 1.3 DESIGN OF DISCRIMINATORS WITH RESTRICTED APPROXIMABILITY

We start with relatively simple families of distributions  $\mathcal{G}$  such as Gaussian distributions and exponential families, where we can directly design  $\mathcal{F}$  to distinguish pairs of distribution in  $\mathcal{G}$ . As we show in Section 3, for Gaussians it suffices to use one-layer neural networks with ReLU activations as discriminators, and for exponential families to use linear combinations of the sufficient statistics.

In Section 4, we study the family of distributions generated by invertible neural networks. We show that a special type of neural network discriminators with one additional layer than the generator has restricted approximability<sup>3</sup>. We show this discriminator class guarantees that  $W_{1}(p,q)^{2} \lesssim W_{\mathcal{F}}(p,q) \lesssim W_{1}(p,q)$  where here we hide polynomial dependencies on relevant parameters (Theorem 4.2). We remark that such networks can also produce an exponentially large number of modes due to the non-linearities, and our results imply that if  $W_{\mathcal{F}}(p,q)$  is small, then most of these exponential modes will show up in the learned distribution  $q$ .

One limitation of the invertibility assumption is that it only produces distributions supported on the entire space. The distribution of natural images is often believed to reside approximately on a low-dimensional manifold. When the distribution  $p$  have a Lebesgue measure-zero support, the KL-divergence (or the reverse KL-divergence) is infinity unless the support of the estimated distribution coincides with the support of  $p$ . Therefore, the KL-divergence is fundamentally not the proper measurement of the statistical distance for the cases where both  $p$  and  $q$  have low-dimensional supports.

The crux of the technical part of the paper is to establish the approximation of Wasserstein distance by IPMs for generators with low-dimensional supports. We will show that a variant of an IPM can still be sandwiched by Wasserstein distance as in form of eq. (5) without relating to KL-divergence (Theorem 4.5). This demonstrates the advantage of GANs over MLE approach on learning distributions with low-dimensional supports. As the main proof technique, we develop tools for approximating the log-density of a smoothed neural network generator.

We demonstrate in synthetic and controlled experiments that the IPM correlates with the Wasserstein distance for low-dimensional dimensions with measure-zero support and correlates with KL-divergence for the invertible generator family (where computation of KL is feasible) (Section 5,

details deferred into Appendix F and G.) The theory suggests the possibility that when the KL-divergence or Wasserstein distance is not measurable in more complicated settings, the test IPM could serve as a candidate alternative for measuring the diversity and quality of the learned distribution. We also remark that on real datasets, often the optimizer is tuned to carefully balance the learning of generators and discriminators, and therefore the reported training loss is often not the test IPM (which requires optimizing the discriminator until optimality.) Anecdotally, the distributions learned by GANs can often be distinguished by a well-trained discriminator from the data distribution, which suggests that the IPM is not well-optimized (See (Lopez-Paz & Oquab, 2016) for analysis of for the original GANs formulation.) We conjecture that the lack of diversity in real experiments may be caused by sub-optimality of the optimization, rather than statistical inefficiency.

# 1.4 RELATED WORK

Various empirical proxy tests for diversity, memorization, and generalization have been developed, such as interpolation between images (Radford et al., 2016), semantic combination of images via arithmetic in latent space (Bojanowski et al., 2017), classification tests (Santurkar et al., 2017), etc. These results by and large indicate that while "memorization" is not an issue with most GANs, lack of diversity frequently is.

As discussed thoroughly in the introduction, Arora et al. (2017a;b) formalized the potential theoretical sources of mode collapse from a weak discriminator, and proposed a "birthday paradox" that convincingly demonstrates this phenomenon is real. Many architectures and algorithms have been proposed to remedy or ameliorate mode collapse ((Dumoulin et al., 2016; Srivastava et al., 2017; Di & Yu, 2017; Borji, 2018; Lin et al., 2017)) with varying success. Feizi et al. (2017) showed provable guarantees of training GANs with quadratic discriminators when the generators are Gaussians. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no provable solutions to this problem in more substantial generality.

The inspiring work of Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2017) shows that the IPM is a proper metric (instead of a pseudo-metric) under a mild regularity condition. Moreover, it provides a KL-divergence bound with finite samples when the densities of the true and estimated distribution exist. Our Section 4.1 can be seen as an extension of (Zhang et al., 2017, Proposition 2.9 and Corollary 3.5). The strength in our work is that we develop statistical guarantees in Wasserstein distance for distributions such as injective neural network generators, where the data distribution resides on a low-dimensional manifold and thus does not have proper density.

Liang (2017) considers GANs in a non-parametric setup, one of the messages being that the sample complexity for learning GANs improves with the smoothness of the generator family. However, the rate they derive is non-parametric – exponential in the dimension – unless the Fourier spectrum of the target family decays extremely fast, which can potentially be unrealistic in practical instances.

The invertible generator structure was used in Flow-GAN (Grover et al., 2018), which observes that GAN training blows up the KL on real dataset. Our theoretical result and experiments show that successful GAN training (in terms of the IPM) does imply learning in KL-divergence when the data distribution can be generated by an invertible neural net. This suggests, along with the message in (Grover et al., 2018), that the real data cannot be generated by an invertible neural network. In addition, our theory implies that if the data can be generated by an injective neural network (Section 4.2), we can bound the closeness between the learned distribution and the true distribution in Wasserstein distance (even though in this case, the KL divergence is no longer an informative measure for closeness.)

# 2 PRELIMINARIES AND NOTATION

The notion of IPM (recall the definition in eq. (1)) includes a number of statistical distances such as TV (total variation) and Wasserstein-1 distance by taking  $\mathcal{F}$  to be 1-bounded and 1-Lipschitz functions respectively. When  $\mathcal{F}$  is a class of neural networks, we refer to the  $\mathcal{F}$ -IPM as the neural net IPM.<sup>5</sup>

There are many distances of interest between distributions that are not IPMs, two of which we will particularly focus on: the KL divergence  $D_{\mathrm{kl}}(p\| q) = \mathbb{E}_p[\log p(X) - \log q(X)]$  (when the densities exist), and the Wasserstein-2 distance, defined as  $W_{2}(p,q)^{2} = \inf_{\pi \in \Pi}\mathbb{E}_{(X,Y)\sim \pi}[\| X - Y\|^{2}]$  where  $\Pi$  be the set of couplings of  $(p,q)$ . We will only consider distributions with finite second moments, so that  $W_{1}$  and  $W_{2}$  exist.

For any distribution  $p$ , we let  $\hat{p}^n$  be the empirical distribution of  $n$  i.i.d. samples from  $p$ . The Rademacher complexity of a function class  $\mathcal{F}$  on a distribution  $p$  is  $R_{n}(\mathcal{F}, p) = \mathbb{E}\left[\sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \left|\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \varepsilon_i f(X_i)\right|\right]$  where  $X_i \sim p$  i.i.d. and  $\varepsilon_i \sim \{\pm 1\}$  are independent. We define  $R_{n}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G}) = \sup_{p \in \mathcal{G}} R_{n}(\mathcal{F}, p)$  to be the largest Rademacher complexity over  $p \in \mathcal{G}$ . The training IPM loss (over the entire dataset) for the Wasserstein GAN, assuming discriminator reaches optimality, is  $\mathbb{E}_{\hat{q}^n}[W_{\mathcal{F}}(\hat{p}^n, \hat{q}^n)]^6$ . Generalization of the IPM is governed by the quantity  $R_{n}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G})$ , as stated in the following result (see Appendix A.1 for the proof):

Theorem 2.1 (Generalization, c.f. (Arora et al., 2017a)). For any  $p \in \mathcal{G}$ , we have that

$$
\forall q \in \mathcal {G}, \mathbb {E} _ {\hat {p} ^ {n}} \left| W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) - \mathbb {E} _ {\hat {q} ^ {n}} \left[ W _ {\mathcal {F}} (\hat {p} ^ {n}, \hat {q} ^ {n}) \right] \right| \leq 4 R _ {n} (\mathcal {F}, \mathcal {G}).
$$

Miscellaneous notation. We let  $\mathsf{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$  denote a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution with mean  $\mu$  and covariance  $\Sigma$ . For quantities  $a, b > 0$ $a \lesssim b$  denotes that  $a \leq Cb$  for a universal constant  $C > 0$  unless otherwise stated explicitly.

# 3 RESTRICTED APPROXIMABILITY FOR BASIC DISTRIBUTIONS

# 3.1 GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS

As a warm-up, we design discriminators with restricted approximability for relatively simple parameterized distributions such Gaussian distributions, exponential families, and mixtures of Gaussians. We first prove that one-layer neural networks with ReLU activation are strong enough to distinguish Gaussian distributions with the restricted approximability guarantees.

We consider the set of Gaussian distributions with bounded mean and well-conditioned covariance  $\mathcal{G} = \{p_{\theta} = \mathsf{N}(\mu ,\Sigma):\| \mu \| _2\leq D,\sigma_{\min}^2 I_d\preceq \Sigma \preceq \sigma_{\max}^2 I_d\}$ . Here  $D,\sigma_{\mathrm{min}}$  and  $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}$  are considered as given hyper-parameters. We will show that the IPM  $W_{\mathcal{F}}$  induced by the following discriminators has restricted approximability w.r.t.  $\mathcal{G}$ :

$$
\mathcal {F} := \left\{x \mapsto \operatorname {R e L U} \left(v ^ {\top} x + b\right): \| v \| _ {2} \leq 1, | b | \leq D \right\}, \tag {6}
$$

Theorem 3.1. The set of one-layer neural networks ( $\mathcal{F}$  defined in eq. (6)) has restricted approximability w.r.t. the Gaussian distributions in  $\mathcal{G}$  in the sense that for any  $p, q \in \mathcal{G}$

$$
\kappa \cdot W _ {1} (p, q) \lesssim W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \leq W _ {1} (p, q).
$$

with  $\kappa = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\frac{\sigma_{\min}}{\sigma_{\max}}$ . Moreover,  $\mathcal{F}$  satisfies Rademacher complexity bound  $R_{n}(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}) \lesssim \frac{D + \sigma_{\max}\sqrt{d}}{\sqrt{n}}$ .

Apart from absolute constants, the lower and upper bound differ by a factor of  $1 / \sqrt{d}$ . We point out that the  $1 / \sqrt{d}$  factor is not improvable unless using functions more sophisticated than Lipschitz functions of one-dimensional projections of  $x$ . Indeed,  $W_{\mathcal{F}}(p,q)$  is upper bounded by the maximum Wasserstein distance between one-dimensional projections of  $p,q$ , which is on the order of  $W_{1}(p,q) / \sqrt{d}$  when  $p,q$  have spherical covariances. The proof is deferred to Section B.1.

Extension to mixture of Gaussians. Discriminator family  $\mathcal{F}$  with restricted approximability can also be designed for mixture of Gaussians. We defer this result and the proof to Appendix C.

# 3.2 EXPONENTIAL FAMILIES

Now we consider exponential families and show that the linear combinations of the sufficient statistics are a family of discriminators with restricted approximability. Concretely, let  $\mathcal{G} = \{p_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^k\}$  be an exponential family, where  $p_{\theta}(x) = \frac{1}{Z(\theta)} \exp(\langle \theta, T(x) \rangle)$ ,  $\forall x \in \mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ : here  $T : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^k$  is the vector of sufficient statistics, and  $Z(\theta)$  is the partition function. Let the discriminator family be all linear functionals over the features  $T(x) \colon \mathcal{F} = \{x \to \langle v, T(x) \rangle : \|v\|_2 \leq 1\}$ .

Theorem 3.2. Let  $\mathcal{G}$  be the exponential family and  $\mathcal{F}$  be the discriminators defined above. Assume that the log partition function  $\log Z(\theta)$  satisfies that  $\gamma I \preceq \nabla^2 \log Z(\theta) \preceq \beta I$ . Then we have for any  $p, q \in \mathcal{G}$ ,

$$
\frac {\gamma}{\sqrt {\beta}} \sqrt {D _ {\mathrm {k l}} (p \| q)} \leq W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \leq \frac {\beta}{\sqrt {\gamma}} \sqrt {D _ {\mathrm {k l}} (p \| q)}. \tag {7}
$$

If we further assume  $\mathcal{X}$  has diameter  $D$  and  $T(x)$  is  $L$ -Lipschitz in  $\mathcal{X}$ . Then,

$$
\frac {D \gamma}{\sqrt {\beta}} W _ {1} (p, q) \lesssim W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \leq L \cdot W _ {1} (p, q) \tag {8}
$$

Moreover,  $\mathcal{F}$  has Rademacher complexity bound  $R_{n}(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G})\leq \sqrt{\frac{\sup_{\theta\in\Theta}E_{p_{\theta}}[||T(X)||_{2}^{2}]}{n}}.$

We note that the log partition function  $\log Z(\theta)$  is always convex, and therefore our assumptions only require in addition that the curvature (i.e. the Fisher information matrix) has a strictly positive lower bound and a global upper bound. For the bound eq. (8), some geometric assumptions on the sufficient statistics are necessary because the Wasserstein distance intrinsically depends on the underlying geometry of  $x$ , which are not specified in exponential families by default. The proof of eq. (7) follows straightforwardly from the standard theory of exponential families. The proof of eq. (8) requires machinery that we will develop in Section 4 and is therefore deferred to Section B.2.

# 4 RESTRICTED APPROXIMABILITY FOR NEURAL NET GENERATORS

In this section, we design discriminators with restricted approximability for neural net generators, a family of distributions that are widely used in GANs to model real data.

In Section 4.1 we consider the invertible neural networks generators which have proper densities. In Section 4.2, we extend the results to the more general and challenging setting of injective neural networks generators, where the latent variables are allowed to have lower dimension than the observable dimensions (Theorem 4.5) and the distributions no longer have densities.

# 4.1 INVERTIBLE NEURAL NETWORK GENERATORS

In this section, we consider the generators that are parameterized by invertible neural networks<sup>8</sup>. Concretely, let  $\mathfrak{G}$  be a family of neural networks  $\mathfrak{G} = \{G_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}$ . Let  $p_{\theta}$  be the distribution of

$$
X = G _ {\theta} (Z), Z \sim \mathrm {N} \left(0, \operatorname {d i a g} \left(\gamma^ {2}\right)\right). \tag {9}
$$

where  $G_{\theta}$  is a neural network with parameters  $\theta$  and  $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^d$  standard deviation of hidden factors. By allowing the variances to be non-spherical, we allow each hidden dimension to have a different impact on the output distribution. In particular, the case  $\gamma = [\mathbf{1}_k, \delta \mathbf{1}_{d - k}]$  for some  $\delta \ll 1$  has the ability to model data around a "  $k$ -dimensional manifold" with some noise on the level of  $\delta$ .

We are interested in the set of invertible neural networks  $G_{\theta}$ . We let our family  $\mathcal{G}$  consist of standard  $\ell$ -layer feedforward nets  $x = G_{\theta}(z)$  of the form

$$
x = W _ {\ell} \sigma \left(W _ {\ell - 1} \sigma \left(\dots \sigma \left(W _ {1} z + b _ {1}\right) \dots\right) + b _ {\ell - 1}\right) + b _ {\ell},
$$

where  $W_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  are invertible,  $b_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ , and  $\sigma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$  is the activation function, on which we make the following assumption:

Assumption 1 (Invertible generators). Let  $R_W, R_b, \kappa_\sigma, \beta_\sigma > 0, \delta \in (0,1]$  be parameters which are considered as constants (that may depend on the dimension). We consider neural networks  $G_\theta$  that are parameterized by parameters  $\theta = (W_i, b_i)_{i \in [\ell]}$  belonging to the set

$$
\Theta = \Big \{(W _ {i}, b _ {i}) _ {i \in [ \ell ]}: \max  \Big \{\| W _ {i} \| _ {\mathrm {o p}}, \big \| W _ {i} ^ {- 1} \big \| _ {\mathrm {o p}} \Big \} \leq R _ {W}, \| b _ {i} \| _ {2} \leq R _ {b}, \forall i \in [ \ell ] \Big \}.
$$

The activation function  $\sigma$  is twice-differentiable with  $\sigma(0) = 0$ ,  $\sigma'(t) \in [\kappa_{\sigma}^{-1}, 1]$ , and  $|(s^{-1})''/(s^{-1})'| \leq \beta_{\sigma}$ . The standard deviation of the hidden factors satisfy  $\gamma_i \in [\delta, 1]$ .

Clearly, such a neural net is invertible, and its inverse is also a feedforward neural net with activation  $\sigma^{-1}$ . We note that a smoothed version of Leaky ReLU (Xu et al., 2015) satisfies all the conditions on the activation functions. Further, some assumptions on the neural networks are necessary because arbitrary neural networks are likely to be able to implement pseudo-random functions which can't be distinguished from random functions by even any polynomial time algorithms.

Lemma 4.1. For any  $\theta \in \Theta$ , the function  $\log p_{\theta}$  can be computed by a neural network with at most  $\ell + 1$  layers,  $O(\ell d^{2})$  parameters, and activation function among  $\{\sigma^{-1}, \log \sigma^{-1'}, (\cdot)^{2}\}$  of the form

$$
f _ {\phi} (x) = \frac {1}{2} \left\langle h _ {1}, \operatorname {d i a g} \left(\gamma^ {- 2}\right) h _ {1} \right\rangle + \sum_ {k = 2} ^ {\ell} \left\langle \mathbf {1} _ {d}, \log \sigma^ {- 1 ^ {\prime}} \left(h _ {j}\right) \right\rangle + C, \tag {10}
$$

where  $h_{\ell} = W_{\ell}(x - b_{\ell})$ ,  $h_k = W_k(\sigma^{-1}(h_{k+1}) - b_k)$  for  $k \in \{\ell-1, \ldots, 1\}$ , and the parameter  $\phi = ((W_j, b_j)_{j=1}^{\ell}, C)$  satisfies  $\phi \in \Phi = \{\phi : \|W_j\|_{\mathrm{op}} \leq R_W, \|b_j\|_2 \leq R_b, |C| \leq (\ell-1)d\log R_W\}$ . As a direct consequence, the following family  $\mathcal{F}$  of neural networks with activation functions above of at most  $\ell + 2$  layers contains all the functions  $\{\log p - \log q : p, q \in \mathcal{G}\}$ :

$$
\mathcal {F} = \left\{f _ {\phi_ {1}} - f _ {\phi_ {2}}: \phi_ {1}, \phi_ {2} \in \Phi \right\}. \tag {11}
$$

We note that the exact form of the parameterized family  $\mathcal{F}$  is likely not very important in practice, since other family of neural nets also possibly contain good approximations of  $\log p - \log q$  (which can be seen partly from experiments in Section G.)

The proof builds on the change-of-variable formula  $\log p_{\theta}(x) = \log \phi_{\gamma}(G_{\theta}^{-1}(x)) + \log |\operatorname*{det}\frac{\partial G_{\theta}^{-1}(x)}{\partial x}|$  (where  $\phi_{\gamma}$  is the density of  $Z \sim \mathsf{N}(0, \mathrm{diag}(\gamma^2)))$  and the observation that  $G_{\theta}^{-1}$  is a feedforward neural net with  $\ell$  layers. Note that the log-det of the Jacobian involves computing the determinant of the (inverse) weight matrices. A priori such computation is non-trivial for a given  $G_{\theta}$ . However, it's just some constant that does not depend on the input, therefore it can be representable by adding a bias on the final output layer. This frees us from further structural assumptions on the weight matrices (in contrast to the architectures in flow-GANs (Gulrajani et al., 2017)). We defer the proof of Lemma 4.1 to Section D.2.

Theorem 4.2. Suppose  $\mathcal{G} = \{p_{\theta} : \theta \in \Theta\}$  is the set of invertible-generator distributions as defined in eq. (9) satisfying Assumption 1. Then, the discriminator class  $\mathcal{F}$  defined in Lemma 4.1 has restricted approximability w.r.t.  $\mathcal{G}$  in the sense that for any  $p, q \in \mathcal{G}$ ,

$$
W _ {1} (p, q) ^ {2} \lesssim D _ {\mathrm {k l}} (p \| q) + D _ {\mathrm {k l}} (q \| p) \leq W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \lesssim \frac {\sqrt {d}}{\delta^ {2}} \left(W _ {1} (p, q) + d \exp (- 1 0 d)\right),
$$

When  $n \gtrsim \max \left\{d, \delta^{-8} \log 1 / \delta \right\}$ , we have the generalization bound  $R_{n}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G}) \leq \varepsilon_{\mathrm{gen}} := \sqrt{\frac{d^{4} \log n}{\delta^{4} n}}$ .

The proof of Theorem 4.2 uses the following lemma that relates the KL divergence to the IPM when the log densities exist and belong to the family of discriminators.

Lemma 4.3 (Special case of (Zhang et al., 2017, Proposition 2.9)). Let  $\varepsilon > 0$ . Suppose  $\mathcal{F}$  satisfies that for every  $q \in \mathcal{G}$ , there exists  $f \in \mathcal{F}$  such that  $\|f - (\log p - \log q)\|_{\infty} \leq \epsilon$ , and that all the functions in  $\mathcal{F}$  are  $L$ -Lipschitz. Then,

$$
D _ {\mathrm {k l}} (p \| q) + D _ {\mathrm {k l}} (q \| p) - \varepsilon \leq W _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \leq L \cdot W _ {1} (p, q). \tag {12}
$$

We outline a proof sketch of Theorem 4.2 below and defer the full proof to Appendix D.3. As we choose the discriminator class as in Lemma 4.1 which implements  $\log p - \log q$  for any  $p, q \in \mathcal{G}$ ,

by Lemma 4.3,  $W_{\mathcal{F}}(p,q)$  is lower bounded by  $D_{\mathrm{kl}}(p\| q) + D_{\mathrm{kl}}(q\| p)$ . It thus suffices to (1) lower bound this quantity by the Wasserstein distance and (2) upper bound  $W_{\mathcal{F}}(p,q)$  by the Wasserstein distance.

To establish (1), we will prove in Lemma D.3 that for any  $p, q \in \mathcal{G}$

$$
W _ {1} (p, q) ^ {2} \leq W _ {2} (p, q) ^ {2} \lesssim D _ {\mathrm {k l}} (p \| q) + D _ {\mathrm {k l}} (q \| p).
$$

Such a result is the simple implication of transportation inequalities by Bobkov-Götze and Gozlan (Theorem D.1), which state that if  $X \sim p$  (or  $q$ ) and  $f$  is 1-Lipschitz implies that  $f(X)$  is sub-Gaussian, then the inequality above holds. In our invertible generator case, we have  $X = G_{\theta}(Z)$  where  $Z$  are independent Gaussians, so as long as  $G_{\theta}$  is suitably Lipschitz,  $f(X) = f(G_{\theta}(Z))$  is a sub-Gaussian random variable by the standard Gaussian concentration result (Vershynin, 2010).

The upper bound (2) would have been immediate if functions in  $\mathcal{F}$  are Lipschitz globally in the whole space. While this is not strictly true, we give two workarounds - by either doing a truncation argument to get a  $W_{1}$  bound with some tail probability, or a  $W_{2}$  bound which only requires the Lipschitz constant to grow at most linearly in  $\| x\| _2$ . This is done in Theorem D.2 as a straightforward extension of the result in (Polyanskiy & Wu, 2016).

Combining the restricted approximability and the generalization bound, we immediately obtain that if the training succeeds with small expected IPM (over the randomness of the learned distributions), then the estimated distribution  $q$  is close to the true distribution  $p$  in Wasserstein distance.

Corollary 4.4. In the setting of Theorem 4.2, with high probability over the choice of training data  $\hat{p}^n$ , we have that if the training process returns a distribution  $q \in \mathcal{G}$  such that  $\mathbb{E}_{\hat{q}^n}[W_{\mathcal{F}}(\hat{p}^n, \hat{q}^n)] \leq \varepsilon_{\mathrm{train}}$ , then with  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{gen}} := \sqrt{\frac{d^4 \log n}{\delta^4 n}}$ , we have

$$
W _ {1} (p, q) \leq W _ {2} (p, q) \lesssim \left(\varepsilon_ {\text {t r a i n}} + \varepsilon_ {\text {g e n}}\right) ^ {1 / 2}. \tag {13}
$$

We note that the training error is measured by  $\mathbb{E}_{\hat{q}^m}[W_{\mathcal{F}}(\hat{p}^n,\hat{q}^m)]$ , the expected IPM over the randomness of the learned distributions, which is a measurable value because one can draw fresh samples from  $q$  to estimate the expectation. It's an important open question to design efficient algorithms to achieve a small training error according to this definition, and this is left for future work.

# 4.2 INJECTIVE NEURAL NETWORK GENERATORS

In this section we consider injective neural network generators (defined below) which generate distributions residing on a low dimensional manifold. This is a more realistic setting than Section 4.1 for modeling real images, but technically more challenging because the KL divergence becomes infinity, rendering Lemma 4.3 useless. Nevertheless, we design a novel divergence between two distributions that is sandwiched by Wasserstein distance and can be optimized as IPM.

Concretely, we consider a family of neural net generators  $\mathfrak{G} = \{G_{\theta}:\mathbb{R}^{k}\to \mathbb{R}^{d}\}$  where  $k < d$  and  $G_{\theta}$  is injective function. Therefore,  $G_{\theta}$  is invertible only on the image of  $G_{\theta}$ , which is a  $k$ -dimensional manifold in  $\mathbb{R}^d$ . Let  $\mathcal{G}$  be the corresponding family of distributions generated by neural nets in  $\mathfrak{G}$ .

Our key idea is to design a variant of the IPM, which provably approximates the Wasserstein distance. Let  $p^\beta$  denote the convolution of the distribution  $p$  with a Gaussian distribution  $\mathsf{N}(0,\beta^2 I)$ . We define a smoothed  $\mathcal{F}$ -IPM between  $p,q$  as

$$
\tilde {d} _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \triangleq \inf  _ {\beta \geq 0} \left(W _ {\mathcal {F}} \left(p ^ {\beta}, q ^ {\beta}\right) + \beta \log 1 / \beta\right) ^ {1 / 2}, \tag {14}
$$

Clearly  $\tilde{d}_{\mathcal{F}}$  can be optimized as  $W_{\mathcal{F}}$  with an additional variable  $\beta$  introduced in the optimization. We show that for certain discriminator class (see Section E for the details of the construction) such that  $\tilde{d}_{\mathcal{F}}$  approximates the Wasserstein distance.

Theorem 4.5 (Informal version of Theorem E.1). Let  $\mathcal{G}$  be defined as above. The exists a discriminator class  $\mathcal{F}$  such that for any pair of distributions  $p, q \in \mathcal{G}$ , we have

$$
W _ {1} (p, q) \lesssim \tilde {d} _ {\mathcal {F}} (p, q) \lesssim \operatorname {p o l y} (d) \cdot W _ {1} (p, q) ^ {1 / 6} + \exp (- \Omega (d)). \tag {15}
$$

Furthermore, when  $n \gtrsim poly(d)$ , we have the generalization bound

$$
R _ {n} (\mathcal {F}, \mathcal {G}) \lesssim \operatorname {p o l y} (d) \sqrt {\frac {\log n}{n}}
$$

Here  $\mathrm{poly}(d)$  hides polynomial dependencies on  $d$  and several other parameters that will be defined in the formal version (Theorem E.1.)

The direct implication of the theorem is that if  $\tilde{d} (\hat{p}^n,\hat{q}^n)$  is small for  $n\gtrsim \mathrm{poly}(d)$ , then  $W(p,q)$  is guaranteed to be also small and thus we don't have mode collapse.

# 5 SIMULATION

We perform two sets of synthetic experiments to confirm they are consistent with our theory. We briefly describe them here, and details are deferred to Appendix F and G:

(a) We learn the unit circle and the Swiss roll curve in 2D with neural net generators and neural net discriminators (Appendix F). Results show that the IPM is well-correlated with the Wasserstein distance and visual sample quality. We note that such test can only be done in low-dimension because in high-dimension Wasserstein distance between two distributions is not efficiently computable given generators or densities for the two distributions.  
(b) We learn invertible neural net generators with discriminators of restricted approximability and vanilla architectures (Appendix G). We show that the IPM is well-correlated with the KL divergence, both along training and when we consider two generators that are perturbations of each other (the purpose of the latter being to eliminate any effects of the optimization).

# 6 CONCLUSION

We present the first polynomial-in-dimension sample complexity bounds for learning various distributions (such as Gaussians, exponential families, invertible neural networks generators) using GANs with convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance (for distributions with low-dimensional supports) or KL divergence. The analysis technique proceeds via designing discriminators with restricted approximability - a class of discriminators tailored to the generator class in consideration which have good generalization and mode collapse avoidance properties.

We hope our techniques can be in future extended to other families of distributions with tighter sample complexity bounds. This would entail designing discriminators that have better restricted approximability bounds, and generally exploring and generalizing approximation theory results in the context of GANs. We hope such explorations will prove as rich and satisfying as they have been in the vanilla functional approximation settings.
