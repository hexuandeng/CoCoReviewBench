# ABSTRACT

State-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models often learn to model dataset biases and surface form correlations instead of features that target the intended underlying task. Previous work has demonstrated effective methods to circumvent these issues when knowledge of the bias is available. We consider cases where the bias issues may not be explicitly identified, and show a method for training models that learn to ignore these problematic correlations. Our approach relies on the observation that models with limited capacity primarily learn to exploit biases in the dataset. We can leverage the errors of such limited capacity models to train a more robust model in a product of experts, thus bypassing the need to hand-craft a biased model. We show the effectiveness of this method to retain improvements in out-of-distribution settings even if no particular bias is targeted by the biased model.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The natural language processing community has made tremendous progress in using pre-trained language models to improve predictive accuracy (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019). Models have now surpassed human performance on language understanding benchmarks such as SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019). However, studies have shown that these results are partially driven by these models detecting superficial cues that correlate well with labels but which may not be useful for the intended underlying task (Jia & Liang, 2017; Schwartz et al., 2017). This brittleness leads to overestimating model performance on the artificially constructed tasks and poor performance in out-of-distribution or adversarial examples.

A well-studied example of this phenomenon is the natural language inference dataset MNLI (Williams et al., 2018). The generation of this dataset led to spurious surface patterns that correlate noticeably with the labels. Poliak et al. (2018) highlight that negation words ("not", "no", etc.) are often associated with the contradiction label. Gururangan et al. (2018); Poliak et al. (2018); Tsuchiya (2018) show that a model trained solely on the hypothesis, completely ignoring the intended signal, reaches strong performance. We refer to these surface patterns as dataset biases since the conditional distribution of the labels given such biased features is likely to change in examples outside the training data distribution (as formalized by He et al. (2019)).

A major challenge in representation learning for NLP is to produce models that are robust to these dataset biases. Previous work (He et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Mahabadi et al., 2020) has targeted removing dataset biases by explicitly factoring them out of models. These works explicitly construct a biased model, for instance, a hypothesis-only model for NLI experiments, and use it to improve the robustness of the main model. The core idea is to encourage the main model to find a different explanation where the biased model is wrong. During training, products-of-experts ensembling (Hinton, 2002) is used to factor out the biased model.

While these works show promising results, the assumption of knowledge of the underlying dataset bias is quite restrictive. Finding dataset biases in established datasets is a costly and time-consuming process, and may require access to private details about the annotation procedure, while actively reducing surface correlations in the collection process of new datasets is challenging given the number of potential biases (Zellers et al., 2019; Sakaguchi et al., 2020).

In this work, we explore methods for learning from biased datasets which do not require such an explicit formulation of the dataset biases. We first show how a model with limited capacity, which we call a weak learner, trained with a standard cross-entropy loss learns to exploit biases in the dataset. We then investigate the biases on which this weak learner relies and show that they match several previously manually identified biases. Based on this observation, we leverage such limited capacity models in a product of experts ensemble to train a more robust model and evaluate our approach in various settings ranging from toy datasets up to large crowd-sourced benchmarks: controlled synthetic bias setup (He et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019), natural language inference (McCoy et al., 2019b) and extractive question answering (Jia & Liang, 2017).

Our contributions are the following: (a) we show that weak learners are prone to relying on shallow heuristics and highlight how they rediscover previously human-identified dataset biases; (b) we demonstrate that we do not need to explicitly know or model dataset biases to train more robust models that generalize better to out-of-distribution examples; (c) we discuss the design choices for weak learners and show trade-offs between higher out-of-distribution performance at the expense of the in-distribution performance.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Many studies have reported dataset biases in various settings. Examples include visual question answering (Jabri et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016), story completion (Schwartz et al., 2017), and reading comprehension (Kaushik & Lipton, 2018; Chen et al., 2016). Towards better evaluation methods, researchers have proposed to collect "challenge" datasets that account for surface correlations a model might adopt (Jia & Liang, 2017; McCoy et al., 2019b). Standard models without specific robust training methods often drop in performance when evaluated on these challenge sets.

While these works have focused on data collection, another approach is to develop methods allowing models to ignore dataset biases during training. Several active areas of research tackle this challenge by adversarial training (Belinkov et al., 2019; Stacey et al., 2020) or example forgetting (Toneva et al., 2019; Yaghoobzadeh et al., 2019). Previous work (He et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Mahabadi et al., 2020) has shown the effectiveness of product of experts to train un-biased models. In our work, we show that we do not need to explicitly model dataset biases to apply these de-biasing methods and can use a more general setup than previously presented.

Orthogonal to these evaluation and optimization efforts, data augmentation has attracted interest as a way to reduce model biases by explicitly modifying the dataset distribution (Min et al., 2020; Belinkov & Bisk, 2018), either by leveraging human knowledge about dataset biases such as swapping male and female entities (Zhao et al., 2018) or by developing dynamic data collection and benchmarking (Nie et al., 2020). Our work is mostly orthogonal to these efforts and alleviates the need for a human-in-the-loop setup which is common to such data-augmentation approaches.

Large pre-trained language models have contributed to improved out-of-distribution generalization (Hendrycks et al., 2020). However, in practice, that remains a challenge in natural language processing (Linzen, 2020; Yogatama et al., 2019) and our work aims at out-of-distribution robustness without significantly compromising in-distribution performance.

Finally, as we were preparing this manuscript for submission, we became aware of a parallel work (Utama et al., 2020) which presents a related de-biasing method leveraging shallow models's mistakes without the need to explicitly model dataset biases. Our approach is different in several ways, in particular we advocate for using limited capacity weak learner while Utama et al. (2020) uses the same architecture as the robust model trained on a few thousands examples. We investigated the trade-off between learner's capacity and resulting performances as well as the resulting few-shot learning regime in the limit of a high capacity weak model.

# 3 METHOD

# 3.1 OVERVIEW

Our approach utilizes product of experts (Hinton, 2002) to factor dataset biases out of a learned model. We have access to a training set  $(x_{i},y_{i})_{1\leq i\leq N}$  where each example  $x_{i}$  has a label  $y_{i}$  among

$K$  classes. We use two models  $f_{W}$  (weak) and  $f_{M}$  (main) which produce respective logits vectors  $\mathbf{w}$  and  $\mathbf{m} \in \mathbb{R}^{K}$ . The product of experts ensemble of  $f_{W}$  and  $f_{M}$  produces logits vector  $\mathbf{e}$

$$
\forall 1 \leq j \leq K, e ^ {j} = w ^ {j} + m ^ {j} \tag {1}
$$

Equivalently, we have  $\mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{e}) = \mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{w})\odot \mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{m})$  where  $\odot$  is the element-wise multiplication.

Our training approach can be decomposed in two successive stages: (a) training the weak learner  $f_{W}$  with a standard loss and (b) training a main (robust) model  $f_{M}$  via product of experts to learn from the errors of the weak learner. The core intuition of this method is to encourage the robust model to learn to make predictions that take into account the weak learner's mistakes.

We do not make any assumption on the biases present (or not) in the dataset and rely on letting the weak learner discover them during training. Moreover, in contrast to prior work (Mahabadi et al., 2020; He et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019) in which the weak learner had a hand-engineered bias-specific structure, our approach does not make any specific assumption on the weak learner such as its architecture, capacity, pre-training, etc. The weak learner  $f_{W}$  is trained with standard cross-entropy.

The final goal is producing main model  $f_{M}$ . After training, the weak model  $f_{W}$  is frozen and used only as part of the product of experts. Since the weak model is frozen, only the main model  $f_{M}$  receives gradient updates during training. This is similar to He et al. (2019); Clark et al. (2019) but differs from Mahabadi et al. (2020) who train both weak and main models jointly. For convenience, we refer to the cross-entropy of the prediction  $e$  of Equation 1 as the PoE cross-entropy.

# 3.2 ANALYSIS: THE ROBUST MODEL LEARNS FROM THE ERRORS OF THE WEAK LEARNER

To better explore the impact of PoE training with a weak learner, we consider the special case of binary classification with logistic regression. Here  $w$  and  $m$  are scalar logits and the softmax becomes a sigmoid. The loss of the product of experts for a single positive example is:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {P o E, b i n a r y} = - m - w + \log (1 + \exp (m + w)) \tag {2}
$$

Logit  $w$  is a fixed value since the weak learner is frozen. We also define the entropy of the weak learner as  $\mathcal{H}_w = -p\log (p) - (1 - p)\log (1 - p)$  where  $p = \sigma (w)$  as our measure of certainty.

Different values of  $w$  from the weak learner induce different gradient updates in the main model. Figure 1a shows the gradient update of the main model logit  $m$ . Each of the three curves corresponds to a different value of  $w$  the weak model.

- Weak Model is Certain / Incorrect: the first case (in blue) corresponds to low values of  $w$ . The entropy is low and the loss of the weak model is high. The main model receives gradients even when it is classifying the point correctly ( $\approx m = 5$ ) which encourages  $m$  to compensate for the weak model's mistake.  
- Weak Model is Uncertain: the second case (in red) corresponds to  $w = 0$  which means the weak model's entropy is high (uniform probability over all classes). In this case, product of experts is equal to the main model, and the gradient is equal to the one obtained with cross-entropy.  
- Weak Model is Certain / Correct: the third case (in green) corresponds to high values of  $w$ . The entropy is low and the loss of the weak model is low. In this case,  $m$ 's gradients are "cropped" early on and the main model receives less gradients on average. When  $w$  is extremely high,  $m$  receives no gradient (and the current example is simply ignored).

Put another way, the logit values for which  $m$  receives gradients are shifted according the correctness and certainty of the weak model. Figure 1b shows the concentration of training examples of MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) projected on the 2D coordinates (correctness, certainty) from a trained weak learner (described in Section 4.1). We observe that there are many examples for the 3 cases. More crucially, we verify that the group certain / incorrect is not empty since the examples in this group encourage the model to not rely on the dataset biases.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We consider several different experimental settings that explore the use of a weak learner to isolate and train against dataset biases. All the experiments are conducted on English datasets, and follow the standard setup for BERT training. Our main model is BERT-base (Devlin et al., 2019) with 110M parameters. Except when indicated otherwise, our weak learner is a significantly smaller pre-trained masked language model known as TinyBERT (Turc et al., 2019) with 4M parameters (2 layers, hidden size of 128). The weak learner is fine-tuned on exactly the same data as our main model. For instance, when trained on MNLI, it gets a  $67\%$  development matched accuracy (compared to  $84\%$  for BERT-base).

Part of our discussion relies on natural language inference, which has been widely studied in this area. The classification task is to determine whether a hypothesis statement is true (entailment), false (contradiction) or undetermined (neural) given a premise statement. MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) is the canonical large-scale English dataset to study this problem with 433K labeled examples. For evaluation, it features matched sets (examples from domains encountered in training) and mismatched sets (domains not-seen during training).

Experiments first examine qualitatively the spurious correlations picked up by the method. We then verify the validity of the method on a synthetic experimental setup. Finally, we verify the impact of our method by evaluating robust models on several out-of-distribution sets and discuss the choice of the weak learner.

# 4.1 WEAK LEARNERS REDISCOVER PREVIOUSLY REPORTED DATASET BIASES

Most approaches for circumventing dataset bias require modeling the bias explicitly, for example using a model limited to only the hypothesis in NLI (Gururangan et al., 2018). These approaches are effective, but require isolating specific biases present in a dataset. Since this process is costly, time consuming and error-prone, it is unrealistic to expect such analysis for all new datasets. On the contrary, we hypothesize that weak learners might operate like rapid surface learners (Zellers et al., 2019), picking up on dataset biases without specific signal or input cura

tion and being rather certain of their biased errors (high certainty on the biased prediction errors).

We first investigate whether our weak learner re-discover two well-known dataset biases reported on NLI benchmarks: (a) the presence of negative word in the hypothesis is highly correlated with the contradiction label (Poliak et al., 2018; Gururangan et al., 2018), (b) high word overlap between the premise and the hypothesis is highly correlated with the entailment label (McCoy et al., 2019b).

To this aim, we fine-tune<sup>1</sup> a weak learner on MNLI (Williams et al., 2018). We extract and manually categorize 1,000 training examples wrongly predicted by the weak learner (with a high loss and a high certainty). Table 1 breaks them down per category. Half of these incorrect examples are wrongly predicted as Contradiction and almost all of these contain a negation<sup>2</sup> in the hypothesis. Another half of the examples are incorrectly predicted as Entailment, a majority of these presenting a high lexical overlap between the premise and the hypothesis (5 or more words in common). The weak learner thus appears to predict with high-certainty a Contradiction label whenever the hypothesis contains a negative word and with high-certainty an Entailment label whenever there is a strong lexical overlap between premise/hypothesis. Table 4 in Appendix A.2 presents qualitative examples of dataset biases identified by the fine-tuned weak learner.

This analysis is based on a set of biases referenced in the literature and does not exclude the possibility of other biases being detected by the weak learner. For instance, during this investigation we notice that the presence of "negative sentiment" words (for instance: dull, boring) in the hypothesis appears to be often indicative of a Contradiction prediction. We leave further investigation on such behaviors to future work.

# 4.2 SYNTHETIC EXPERIMENT: CHEATING FEATURE

We consider a controlled synthetic experiment described in He et al. (2019); Clark et al. (2019) that simulates bias. We modify 20,000 MNLI training examples by injecting a cheating feature which encodes an example's label with probability  $p_{\text{cheat}}$  and a random label selected among the two incorrect labels otherwise. On the evaluation sets, the cheating feature is random and does not convey any useful information. In the present experiment, the cheating feature takes the form of a prefix added to the hypothesis. We train the weak and main models on these 20,000 examples and evaluate their accuracy on the matched development set. We expect a biased model to rely mostly on the cheating feature thereby leading to poor evaluation performance.

Figure 2 shows the results. As the proportion of examples containing the bias increases, the

evaluation accuracy of the weak learner quickly decreases to reach  $0\%$  when  $p_{\text{heat}} = 0.9$ . The weak learner detects the cheating feature during training and is mainly relying on the synthetic bias which is not directly indicative of the gold label.

Figure 2: Accuracy on MNLI matched development set for models with a cheating feature. The model trained with PoE (Main Model) is less sensitive to this synthetic bias.

Both He et al. (2019) and Clark et al. (2019) protect against the reliance on this cheating feature by assembling the main model with a biased model that only uses the hypothesis (or its first token). We instead train the main model in the PoE setting, relying on the weak learner to identify the bias. Figure 2 shows that when a majority of the training examples contain the bias  $(p_{\text{cheat}} \geq 0.6)$ , the performance of the model trained with cross-entropy drops faster than the one trained in PoE. PoE training leads to a more robust model by encouraging it to learn from the mistakes of the weak

learner. As  $p_{\text{cheat}}$  comes close to 1, the model's training enters a "few-shot regime" where there are very few incorrectly predicted biased examples to learn from (examples where following the biased heuristic lead to a wrong answer) and the performance of the model trained with PoE drops as well.

# 4.3 ADVERSARIAL DATASETS: NLI AND QA

NLI The HANS adversarial dataset (McCoy et al., 2019b) was constructed by writing templates to generate examples with a high premise/hypothesis word overlap to attack models that rely on this bias. In one template the word overlap generates entailed premise/hypothesis pairs (heuristic-entailed examples), whereas in another the examples contradict the heuristic (non-heuristic-entailed). The dataset contains 30K evaluation examples equally split between both.

Table 2 shows that the weak learner exhibits medium performance on in-distribution and that on out-of-distribution HANS evaluation it relies heavily on the word overlap heuristic Product of experts training is effective at reducing the reliance on biases and leads to significant gains on the heuristic-non-entailed examples when compared to a model trained with standard cross-entropy  $(+24\%)$ .

The small degradation on in-distribution data is likely because PoE training does not specialize for in-distribution performance but focuses on the weak model errors (He et al., 2019). To counteract these effects, we use a linear combination of the original cross-entropy loss and the product of experts loss in a similar fashion to distillation approaches (Hinton et al., 2015). This multi-loss objective trades off out-of-distribution generalization for in-distribution accuracy. A similar trade-off between accuracy and robustness has been reported in adversarial training (Zhang et al., 2019; Tsipras et al., 2019). In Appendix A.5, we detail the influence of this multi-loss objective.

We also evaluate our method on MNLI's hard test set (Gururangan et al., 2018) which is expected to be less biased than MNLI's standard split. These examples are selected such that a hypothesis-only model cannot predict the label accurately. Table 2 shows the results of this experiment. Our method surpasses the performance of a PoE model trained with a hypothesis-only biased learner. Results on the mismatched set are given in Appendix A.3.

QA Question answering models often rely on heuristics such as type and keyword-matching (Weissenborn et al., 2017) that can do well on benchmarks like SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). We evaluate on the Adversarial SQuAD dataset (Jia & Liang, 2017) built by appending distractor sentences to the passages in the original SQuAD. Distractors are constructed such that they look like a plausible answer to the question while not changing the correct answer or misleading humans.

Results on SQuAD v1.1 and Adversarial SQuAD are listed in Table 3. The weak learner alone has low performance both on in-distribution and adversarial sets. PoE training improves the adversarial performance  $(+1\%$  on AddSent) while sacrificing some in-distribution performance. A multi-loss optimization closes the gap and even boosts adversarial robustness  $(+3\%$  on AddSent and  $+2\%$  on

AddOneSent). In contrast to our experiments on MNLI/HANS, multi-loss training thus leads here to better performance on out-of-distribution as well. We hypothesize that in this dataset, the weak learner picks up more useful information and removing it entirely might be non-optimal. Multi-loss in this case allows us to strike a balance between learning from, or removing, the weak learner.

# 5 ANALYSIS

# 5.1 REDUCING BIAS: CORRELATION ANALYSIS

To investigate the behavior of the ensemble of the weak and main learner, we compute the Pearson correlation between the element-wise loss of the weak (biased) learner and the loss of the trained models following Mahabadi et al. (2020). A correlation of 1 indicates a linear relation between the per-example losses (the two learners make the same mistakes), and 0 indicates the absence of linear correlation (models' mistakes are uncorrelated). Figure 3 shows that models trained with a linear combination of the PoE cross-entropy and the standard cross-entropy have a higher correlation than when trained solely with PoE. This confirms that PoE training is effective at reducing biases uncovered by the weak learner and re-emphasizes that adding standard cross-entropy leads to a trade-off between the two.

# 5.2 HOW WEAK

DO THE WEAK LEARNERS NEED TO BE?

We consider parameter size as a measure of the capacity or "weakness" of the weak learner. We fine-tune different sizes of BERT (Turc et al., 2019) ranging from 4.4 to 41.4 million parameters and use these as weak models in a PoE setting. Figure 4b shows the accuracies on MNLI and HANS of the weak learners and main models trained with various weak learners.

Varying the capacity of the weak models affects both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance. Out-of-distribution performance of the main model increases as the weak model becomes stronger (more parameters) up to a certain point while in-distribution performances drop slightly at first and then more strongly. When trained jointly with the larger MediumBERT weak learner, the main model gets  $97\%$  accuracy on HANS's heuristic-non-entailed set but a very low accuracy on the in-distribution examples ( $28\%$  on MNLI and  $3\%$  on the heuristic-entailed examples).

(b) Performance of main models (PoE)

As a weak model grows in capacity, it becomes a better learner. The average loss decreases and the model becomes more confident in its predictions. As a result, the group certain / correct becomes more populated and the main model receives on average a smaller gradient magnitude per input. On the contrary, the certain / incorrect group (which generally align with out-of-distribution samples and induce higher magnitude gradient updates, encouraging generalization at the expense of in-distribution performance) becomes less populated. This is reminiscent of findings from Vodrahalli et al. (2018) and Shrivastava et al. (2016): not all training samples contribute equally towards learning and in some cases, a carefully selected subset of the training set is sufficient to match (or surpass) the performance on the whole set.

We present complementary analyses in Appendix: In Appendix A.4, we evaluate the ability of our method to generalize to other domains that do not share the same annotation artifacts. We highlight the trade-off between in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness by quantifying the influence of the multi-loss objective in Appendix A.5 and draw a connection between our 3 groups of examples and recently introduced Data Maps (Swayamdipta et al., 2020).

# 6 CONCLUSION

We have presented an effective method for training models robust to dataset biases. Leveraging a weak learner with limited capacity and a modified product of experts training setup, we show that dataset biases do not need to be explicitly known or modeled to be able to train models that can generalize significantly better to out-of-distribution examples. We discuss the design choices for such weak learner and investigate how using higher-capacity learners leads to higher out-of-distribution performance and a trade-off with in-distribution performance. We believe that such approaches capable of automatically identifying and mitigating datasets bias will be essential tools for future bias-discovery and mitigation techniques.
