# ABSTRACT

Many real-world data distributions are multi-modal; a common example is the distribution of topics in written language. Though recent advances in neural variational inference have facilitated efficient training of powerful directed latent variable models, the models learned often use simple priors. These are convenient for approximate inference, but only capture a single mode of the target distribution. This restriction hinders the overall expressivity of the learned model as it cannot possibly capture more complex aspects of the data distribution, especially multi-modality. To remove this key restriction, we propose an efficient prior that can potentially capture an exponential number of modes of a target distribution. As such, we develop the multimodal variational encoder-decoder framework and investigate the effectiveness of our prior in a variety of text modeling tasks, including document modeling and dialogue modeling.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Since the development of the variational autoencoding framework (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014), a tremendous amount of progress has been made in learning large-scale, directed latent variable models. This approach has lead to improved performance in applications ranging from computer vision (Gregor et al., 2015; Larsen et al., 2015) to natural language processing (NLP) (Mnih & Gregor, 2014; Miao et al., 2015; Bowman et al., 2015; Serban et al., 2016). Furthermore, such models naturally incorporate a Bayesian modeling perspective, by enabling the integration of problem-dependent knowledge in the form of a prior on the generating distribution

However, the majority of models proposed assume an extremely simple prior in the form of a multivariate Gaussian distribution in order to maintain mathematical and computational tractability. Although this assumption on the prior has lead to favorable results on several tasks (Miao et al., 2015), it is clearly a restrictive and often unrealistic assumption. First, it imposes a strong unimodal structure on the latent variable space: latent samples from the generating model (prior distribution) all cluster around a single mean. Second, it encourages local smoothness on the latent variables: the similarity between two latent variables decreases exponentially as their distance increases. Thus, for complex, multi-modal distributions — such as the distribution over topics in a text corpus, or natural language responses in a dialogue system — this Gaussian uni-modal prior inhibits the model's ability to extract and represent important structure in the data. To learn more powerful and expressive models — in particular, models with multi-modal latent variable structures for natural language processing applications — we seek a suitable and flexible prior than can be automatically adapted to model multiple modes of a target distribution.

In this paper, we propose the multimodal variational encoder-decoder framework, introducing an efficient, adjustable prior model that is suitable for distributions such as those found in text corpora. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our multimodal variational architectures in two representative tasks: document modeling and dialogue modeling. We find that our prior is able to

capture elements of a target distribution that simpler priors alone, such as the unimodal Gaussian, cannot model, thus allowing neural latent variable models to extract richer structure from data.

# 2 RELATED WORK

The idea of using an artificial neural network to approximate an inference model dates back several years (Hinton & Zemel, 1994; Hinton et al., 1995; Dayan & Hinton, 1996). However, original attempts at such an approach have been hindered by the lack of low-variance estimators of parameter gradients. Traditionally, one resorts to Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) (Neal, 1992) which does not scale well and mixes slowly, or one utilizes a variational approach which requires a tractable, factored distribution to approximate the posterior, usually under-estimating the posterior (Jordan et al., 1999). Others have proposed using feed-forward inference models to efficiently initialize the mean-field inference algorithm for incrementally training Boltzmann architectures (Salakhutdinov & Larochelle, 2010; Ororbia II et al., 2015), however, these are limited by the mean-field inference's inability to model structured posteriors. Mnih & Gregor (2014) proposed the neural variational inference and learning (NVIL) approach (building on the success of Rezende et al. (2014)) to match the true posterior directly without resorting to approximate inference. NVIL allows for the joint training of an inference network and directed generative model, maximizing a variational lower-bound on the data log-likelihood. Notably, one may exactly sample the variational posterior, thus reducing variance in gradient estimates.

With respect to document modeling, it has been demonstrated that neural architectures can outperform reliable, standard topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for example using Boltzmann-based approaches that learn semantic binary vectors (Hofmann, 1999). Examples of this line of work include the constrained Poisson model (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009), the Replicated Softmax (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2009) and the Over-Replicated Softmax (Srivastava et al., 2013) models, as well as similar, auto-regressive neural architectures (Larochelle & Lauly, 2012; Uria et al., 2014; Lauly et al., 2016). Other models that have learned continuous representations instead include (Maas et al., 2011; Bowman et al., 2015). Mnih & Gregor (2014) showed that using NVIL yielded better generative models of documents than these previous approaches.

In dialogue modeling, latent variable models have also proven to be quite useful. Recently, neural models have been shown to outperform traditional Markov Decision Process (MDP) approaches ...

# 3 THE MULTIMODAL VARIATIONAL ENCODER-DECODER FRAMEWORK

We start by describing the general neural variational learning framework and then present our proposed prior model aimed at enhancing the model's ability to learn multiple modes of data distributions.

# 3.1 NEURAL VARIATIONAL LEARNING

Given a sequence of words,  $w_{1},\ldots ,w_{N}$  conditioned on a continuous latent variable  $z$  , the latent variable model exhibits the following directed graphical model:

$$
P _ {\theta} \left(w _ {1}, \dots , w _ {N}, z\right) = \int \prod_ {n = 1} ^ {N} P _ {\theta} \left(w _ {n} \mid w _ {<   n}, z\right) P _ {\theta} (z) d z. \tag {1}
$$

The model is used to first generate the higher-level, continuous latent variable  $z$ , and then conditioned on this generates the word sequence. The document modeling task further simplifies this model by assuming the words are independent of each other:

$$
P _ {\theta} \left(w _ {1}, \dots , w _ {N}, z\right) = \int \prod_ {n = 1} ^ {N} P _ {\theta} \left(w _ {n} \mid z\right) P _ {\theta} (z) d z. \tag {2}
$$

The variational autoencoder uses the variational lower-bound to learn the parameters:

$$
\log P _ {\theta} \left(w _ {1}, \dots , w _ {N}, z\right) \geq \mathrm {E} _ {z \sim Q \left(z \mid w _ {1}, \dots , w _ {N}\right)} \left[ \log P _ {\theta} \left(w _ {n} \mid w _ {<   n}, z\right) \right] - \mathrm {K L} [ Q (z \mid w _ {1}, \dots , w _ {N}) | | P (z) ], \tag {3}
$$

where  $Q(z|w_1, \ldots, w_N)$  is the approximation to the posterior for  $z$ , called the encoder, or sometimes the recognition model or inference model, while  $P(z)$  is the prior model for  $z$ . The variational autoencoder (VAE) further makes use of the re-parametrization trick, which allows one to move the derivative of the lower-bound inside the expectation. To do this, we need to parametrize  $z$  as a transformation from a fixed (parameter-less) random distribution:

$$
z = f _ {\theta} (\epsilon), \tag {4}
$$

where  $\epsilon$  is a random distribution, e.g. standard Gaussian (with zero mean and unit standard deviation) or a uniform distribution in the interval  $[0,1]$ , and  $f$  is some transformation of this variable, parametrized by  $\theta$ .

The majority of work on VAEs that uses the re-parametrization trick proposes to parametrize  $z$  (both the prior and approximate posterior) as a multivariate Gaussian variable. However, the multivariate Gaussian is a uni-modal distribution and, thus, can capture only one mode of the data - which is often a poor approximation of the distribution.<sup>1</sup>

# 3.2 THE PIECEWISE-CONSTANT PRIOR FOR LATENT VARIABLES

In this work, we overcome the uni-modal restriction by parametrizing  $z$  using a piecewise constant probability density function (PDF). Our motivation is that such a parametrization will allow  $z$  to represent complex aspects of the data distribution, such as multiple modes, and highly non-smooth regions of probability mass. From a manifold learning perspective, this extension translates into expanding the set of manifolds representable by the model parameters to include more non-linear manifolds – in particular, manifolds where there exists separate clusters of probability mass.

Let  $n \in \mathbb{N}$  be the number of piecewise constant components. Assume  $z$  has the following PDF:

$$
P (z) = \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} 1 \left(\frac {i - 1}{n} \leq z \leq \frac {i}{n}\right) a _ {i}, \tag {5}
$$

where  $a_{i} > 0$  for  $i = 1, \dots, n$  are the distribution parameters which will be learned during training, and where  $K$  is the normalization constant:

$$
K = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} K _ {i}, \quad \text {w h e r e} K _ {0} := 0, K _ {i} := \frac {a _ {i}}{n} \text {f o r} i = 1, \dots , n, \tag {6}
$$

and  $1_{(x)}$  is the indicator function, which is one whenever  $x$  is true and otherwise zero.

To train the model using the re-parametrization trick, we need to generate  $z = f(\epsilon)$  where  $\epsilon \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$ . To do so, we employ inverse transform sampling (Devroye, 1986), which requires finding the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF). First, we find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Equation 5:

$$
\phi (z) = \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} 1 \left(\frac {i}{n} \leq z\right) K _ {i} + 1 \left(\frac {i - 1}{n} \leq z \leq \frac {i}{n}\right) \left(z - \frac {i - 1}{n}\right) a _ {i}. \tag {7}
$$

Next, we find the inverse of this CDF:

$$
\phi^ {- 1} (\epsilon) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} 1 \left(\frac {1}{K} \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {i - 1} K _ {j} \leq \epsilon \leq \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {i} K _ {j}\right) \left(\frac {i - 1}{n} + \frac {K}{a _ {i}} \left(\epsilon - \frac {1}{K} \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {i - 1} K _ {j}\right)\right) \tag {8}
$$

Figure 1: The horizontal axis corresponds to  $x_{1}$ , which is a univariate Gaussian variable. The vertical axis corresponds to  $x_{2}$ , which is a piecewise constant variable. The PDF for each variable is shown along each axis, and their joint distribution is illustrated in grey color.

Armed with the above inverse CDF, we can now generate a sample  $z$ :

$$
z = \phi^ {- 1} (\epsilon), \quad \text {w h e r e} \epsilon \sim \operatorname {U n i f o r m} (0, 1). \tag {9}
$$

In addition to sampling, we need to compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the prior and posterior distributions of the piecewise constant variables. We assume that both the prior and the posterior are piecewise constant, and use prior to denote prior parameters and post to denote posterior parameters. The KL divergence between the prior and posterior can be computed using a sum of integrals, where each integral inside the sum corresponds to one constant segment:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {K L} [ Q (z | x) | | P (z) ] = \int_ {0} ^ {1} Q (z | x) \log \left(\frac {Q (z | x)}{P (z)}\right) d z (10) \\ = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \int_ {0} ^ {1 / n} \frac {a _ {i} ^ {\text {p o s t}}}{K ^ {\text {p o s t}}} \log \left(\frac {a _ {i} ^ {\text {p o s t}} / K ^ {\text {p o s t}}}{a _ {i} ^ {\text {p r i o r}} / K ^ {\text {p r i o r}}}\right) d z (12) \\ = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {a _ {i} ^ {\text {p o s t}}}{K ^ {\text {p o s t}}} \log \left(\frac {a _ {i} ^ {\text {p o s t}} / K ^ {\text {p o s t}}}{a _ {i} ^ {\text {p r i o r}} / K ^ {\text {p r i o r}}}\right) (13) \\ = \frac {1}{n} \frac {1}{K ^ {\text {p o s t}}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} a _ {i} ^ {\text {p o s t}} \left(\log \left(a _ {i} ^ {\text {p o s t}}\right) - \log \left(a _ {i} ^ {\text {p r i o r}}\right)\right) (14) \\ + \log (K ^ {\text {p r i o r}}) - \log (K ^ {\text {p o s t}}) \\ \end{array}
$$

One can now take derivatives with respect to each relevant parameter (i.e., the  $a_i$ 's,  $K_j$ 's and  $K$  for both the prior and posterior models) in order to integrate Equations 8 and 14 into an automatic differentiation framework (the derivations of which can be found in our publicly available code at XXXX). Figure 1 illustrates how the piecewise constant latent variables can work with Gaussian latent variables in order to model multi-modality.

# 4 LATENT VARIABLE PARAMETRIZATIONS

Parametrizing the latent variable distributions well is crucial in obtaining good predictive performance. This section describes one parametrization, which we believe to be effective. We will develop the parametrizations for both the standard Gaussian case and our proposed piecewise latent variable case.

For all parametrizations, let  $c$  be the conditioning information for the prior. In document modeling  $c = 0$ , while in dialogue modeling  $c$  is the dialogue context, namely all previous utterances until the current time step. As before, let  $x$  be the current observation, which the model must generate.

# 4.1 GAUSSIAN PARAMETRIZATION

Let  $\mu^{\mathrm{prior}}$  and  $\sigma^{2,\mathrm{prior}}$  be the prior mean and variance, and let  $\mu^{\mathrm{post}}$  and  $\sigma^{2,\mathrm{post}}$  be the posterior mean and variance. For Gaussian latent variables, the prior distribution mean and variances are usually encoded using linear transformations of the hidden state. In particular, the prior distribution covariance is encoded as a diagonal covariance matrix using a softplus function:

$$
\mu^ {\text {p r i o r}} = H _ {\mu} ^ {\text {p r i o r}} \operatorname {E n c} (c) + b _ {\mu} ^ {\text {p r i o r}}, \tag {15}
$$

$$
\sigma^ {2, \text {p r i o r}} = \operatorname {d i a g} \left(\log \left(1 + \exp \left(H _ {\sigma} ^ {\text {p r i o r}} \operatorname {E n c} (c) + b _ {\sigma} ^ {\text {p r i o r}}\right)\right)\right), \tag {16}
$$

where  $\operatorname{Enc}(c)$  is an embedding/encoding of the context  $c$  (e.g. given by a bag-of-words encoder or an LSTM encoder applied to  $c$ ), which is shared across all latent variable dimensions. The parameters  $H_{\mu}^{\text{prior}}$ ,  $b_{\mu}^{\text{prior}}$ ,  $H_{\sigma}^{\text{prior}}$ ,  $b_{\sigma}^{\text{prior}}$  are to be learned.

For the posterior distribution, previous experiments on dialogue have shown that it is much better to parametrize the posterior distribution by interpolating between the prior distribution mean and variance and a new estimate of the mean and variance(). This interpolation is controlled by a gating mechanism, which makes it easy for the model to learn how to turn on or off different latent components:

$$
\mu^ {\text {p o s t}} = \left(1 - \alpha_ {\mu}\right) \mu^ {\text {p r i o r}} + \alpha_ {\mu} \left(H _ {\mu} ^ {\text {p o s t}} \operatorname {E n c} (c, x) + b _ {\mu} ^ {\text {p o s t}}\right), \tag {17}
$$

$$
\sigma^ {2, \text {p o s t}} = (1 - \alpha_ {\sigma}) \sigma^ {2, \text {p r i o r}} + \alpha_ {\sigma} \operatorname {d i a g} (\log (1 + \exp \left(H _ {\sigma} ^ {\text {p o s t}} \operatorname {E n c} (c, x) + b _ {\sigma} ^ {\text {p o s t}}\right))), \tag {18}
$$

where  $\operatorname{Enc}(c, x)$  is an encoding/embedding of both  $c$  and  $x$ , and where the parameters are  $H_{\mu}^{\mathrm{post}}, b_{\mu}^{\mathrm{post}}, H_{\sigma}^{\mathrm{post}}, b_{\sigma}^{\mathrm{post}}, \alpha_{\mu}, \alpha_{\sigma}$ . The interpolation mechanism is controlled by  $\alpha_{\mu}$  and  $\alpha_{\sigma}$ , which are initialized to zero (i.e. initialized such that the posterior is equal to the prior).<sup>2</sup>

# 4.2 PIECEWISE CONSTANT PARAMETRIZATION

Similar to the Gaussian variances, we propose to parametrize the piecewise constant prior parameters as an exponential function applied to a linear transformation of the context embedding/encoding:

$$
a _ {i} ^ {\text {p r i o r}} = \exp \left(H _ {a, i} ^ {\text {p r i o r}} \operatorname {E n c} (c) + b _ {a, i} ^ {\text {p r i o r}}\right), \quad i = 1, \dots , n, \tag {19}
$$

where  $H_{a}^{\mathrm{prior}}$  and  $b_{a}^{\mathrm{prior}}$  are the parameters to be learned.

We also constrain the piecewise constant posterior parameters to be an interpolation between the prior parameters and a new estimated parameter:

$$
a _ {i} ^ {\text {p o s t}} = \left(1 - \alpha_ {a, i}\right) a _ {i} ^ {\text {p r i o r}} + \alpha_ {a, i} \exp \left(H _ {a, i} ^ {\text {p o s t}} \operatorname {E n c} (c, x) + b _ {a, i} ^ {\text {p o s t}}\right), \quad i = 1, \dots , n, \tag {20}
$$

where  $H_{a}^{\mathrm{post}}$ ,  $b_{a}^{\mathrm{post}}$ ,  $\alpha_{a}$  are the parameters, with an initialization of  $\alpha_{a} = 0$ .

To take advantage of the properties of both priors, the Gaussian and piecewise constant variables may be combined, as was suggested in Section 3.2. In this work, we simply experimented with their concatenation to create a sort of hybrid VAE model.

# 5 VARIATIONAL TEXT MODELING

We now present two probabilistic models, the NVDM and the VHRED, which are extended to incorporate the latent variable parametrization and used for the document and dialogue modeling experiments described below.

# 5.1 NEURAL VARIATIONAL DOCUMENT MODEL (NVDM)

The NVDM framework collapses the recurrent neural encoder into a simpler bag-of-words model (since no symbol order is taken into account), which may be defined as a multi-layer perceptron for  $Enc(c = 0, x) = Enc(x)$ . If we let  $x$  represent a document vector, then  $\mathbf{x}_i$  is the 1-of-  $|V|$  binary encoding of the  $i$ th word in the document in a corpus with vocabulary  $V$ .  $Enc(x)$  is trained to compress a document vector into a continuous distributed representation upon which the prior and posterior models are built.

The NVDM parametrization simplifies prior and posterior distribution models described for both the Gaussian and piecewise constant latent variables, requiring that only the bias parameters,  $b_{a}^{\text{prior}}$ ,  $b_{a}^{\text{post}}$  for the piecewise and  $b_{\mu}^{\text{post}}$ ,  $b_{\sigma}^{\text{post}}$ ,  $b_{\mu}^{\text{prior}}$ ,  $b_{\sigma}^{\text{prior}}$  for the Gaussian, are learned. Since we initialize bias parameters to 0, the NVDM starts with roughly a centered Gaussian prior that will be adapted/shaped by the parametric encoder as learning progresses and as the overall architecture learns to turn on/off different latent variables controlled through the gating mechanism. It is important to note that our particular instantiation of the NVDM is different from that of Mnih & Gregor (2014); Miao et al. (2015) in that, even in the case of using a Gaussian prior, we jointly learn the prior mean and variance whereas in previous work it has been assumed to be a standardized Gaussian. Furthermore, our models learn to interpolate between the generated prior and posterior models to calculate a new posterior.

In this paper, after preliminary experimentation, we chose the encoder to be a 2-hidden layer perceptron, defined by parameters  $\Theta = \{W^0, b^0, W^1, b^1\}$ , while the decoder is defined by parameters  $\Theta = \{R, c\}$ . For example, in the case of the hybrid VAE, using Equations 15-18 to generate the distribution parameters and Equation 8 to draw a sample from the piecewise prior, we may define the full architecture to be:

$$
\pi (x) = f ^ {0} \left(W ^ {0} x + b ^ {0}\right),
$$

$$
E n c (x) = f ^ {1} \left(W ^ {1} \pi (x) + b ^ {1}\right),
$$

$$
z _ {G a u s s i a n} = \mu^ {\text {p o s t}} + \sqrt {\sigma^ {2 , \text {p o s t}}} \otimes \epsilon_ {0},
$$

$$
z _ {\text {P i e c e w i s e}} = \phi^ {- 1, p o s t} (\epsilon_ {1}),
$$

$$
z = \left\langle z _ {\text {G a u s s i a n}}, z _ {\text {P i e c e w i s e}} \right\rangle ,
$$

$$
D e c (z) = g (R z + c),
$$

where we define  $\otimes$  to be the Hadamard product,  $\langle \circ ,\circ \rangle$  is the concatenation operator, and  $Dec(z)$  is the decoder model, which is designed to output a distribution over tokens/words conditioned on the latent variables. As a result of using the re-parametrization trick and choice of prior, we calculate the latent variable  $z$  through the two samples,  $\epsilon_0$  and  $\epsilon_{1}$ , drawn from the appropriate base distributions.  $f(\circ)$  is chosen to be a non-linear activation function, and for the NVDMs in this paper, shall be the softsign function, or  $f(v) = v / (1 + |v|)$ . For the decoder,  $g(\circ)$  is the typical softmax non-linearity (to yield a valid probability distribution), calculated as:

$$
D e c (z) = P _ {\Theta} (x _ {i} | z) = \frac {e x p (x _ {i} R z + c)}{\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {| V |} e x p (R z + c)}.
$$

The decoder's output can then be used to calculate the first term of the variational lower-bound,  $\log P_{\Theta}(x|z)$  and the two distribution models (both prior and posterior) may be used to calculate the required KL term. The lower-bound defined for the NVDM then simply becomes the following:

$$
\mathcal {L} = \operatorname {E} _ {Q (z | x)} \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \log P _ {\theta} \left(x _ {i} | z\right) \right] - \operatorname {K L} [ Q (z | x) | | P (z) ]
$$

and the KL term is simply the sum of the Gaussian and piecewise KL-divergence measures, or KL  $[Q(z|x)||P(z)] = KL_{\text{Gaussian}}[Q(z|x)||P(z)] + KL_{\text{Piecewise}}[Q(z|x)||P(z)]$ . Here, the full KL-term serves as a useful regularizer of the parameter updates for the recognition model.

# 5.2 VARIATIONAL HIERARCHICAL ENCODER-DECODER (VHRED)

# 6 EXPERIMENTS

In order to validate the ability of our piecewise prior in capturing complex aspects of data distributions, such as multi-modality, we conduct experiments with four different models:

1. No latent variables (a data-dependent baseline model).  
2. Gaussian latent variables  
3. Piecewise constant latent variables  
4. Gaussian + piecewise constant latent variables

All models are trained using back-propagation of errors to obtain parameter gradients with respect to the variational lower-bound. The specifics of the design of the encoder and decoder differed between the two tasks (as described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2). For all models that used piecewise latent variables, we chose to fix  $\alpha_{a_i} = 1$ , meaning the piecewise prior and posterior models were kept separate (instead of having the posterior be an interpolation of itself and the prior), as we found this simply encouraged better learning. $^3$

# 6.1 DOCUMENT MODELING

For several experiments we make use of the pre-processed data-sets offered in Cardoso-Cachopo (2007). In particular, we make use of the 20 News-Groups collection (English newswire) and the CADE corpus (Brazilian text). For pre-processing stop-words have been removed, words have been stemmed, and words shorter than 3 characters have been pruned. For 20 News-Groups, we further pre-processed the data by removing terms that occurred less than 130 times to yield a final vocabulary of 2031 terms (comparable to that of Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2009)). For CADE, we filtered terms that occurred less than 130 times to obtain a vocabulary of 3736 terms. For both data-sets, we applied a  $\log(1 + TF)$  transform to the frequency vectors. Similar to Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2009), we created a validation subset of 1000 random vectors drawn from the original training corpus.

In addition, we make use of the NIPS XXX collection, which has also been pre-processed and publicly available. The data-set contains XXXX documents with a vocabulary of XXXX...

For the Gaussian NVDM ( $G$ -NVDM, we constrained the interpolated posterior variance to lie in the range of [0.01, 10.0]). For the piecewise NVDM ( $P$ -NVDM and hybrid NVDM ( $H$ -NVDM, we varied the number of components used in the PDF, investigating the effect that 3, 5, and 7 pieces had on the final quality of the model. All models were trained using standard gradient descent with an annealed learning rate and mini-batches of 20 samples drawn randomly without replacement from

the training data. Model selection and early stopping (the only additional form of regularization employed for this set of experiments) were conducted using the validation lower-bound, estimated using five stochastic samples per validation example. We rescale large gradients by their norm Pascanu et al. (2012).

In Table XXX, we report the test document perplexity calculated using the standard equation XXXXX, where  $P_{\Theta}(x)$ , or the probability of a particular document, was approximated with an estimate of the variational lower-bound using 10 samples, as was done in Mnih & Gregor (2014). As we can see... In Table XXX, we present the top- $k$  highest ranked words per each topic in each corpus to investigate the differences between what terms the latent variables of each different model choose to associate for each known topic in the corpora...

We also qualitatively evaluate the quality of the latent document representations learned by the various document models through a t-SNE visualization Maaten & Hinton (2008), specifically employing the Barnes-Hutt approximation for scalability. As observed in Figure XXXX, it appears that...

# 6.2 DIALOGUE MODELING

We experiment with VHRED for dialogue response generation: given a dialogue context, the model must generate an appropriate response. This is a difficult task, which has been studied extensively in the recent literature Ritter et al. (2011); Lowe et al. (2015); Sordoni et al. (2015);?);?. Such systems for dialogue response generation have also recently gained a significant amount of attention from industry, with high-profile projects such as Google's SmartReply system Kannan et al. (2016) and Microsoft's chatbot Xiaolice Markoff & Mozur (2015). Even more recently, Amazon has announced the Alexa Prize Challenge for the research community with the goal of developing a natural and engaging chatbot system Farber (2016).

We focus on non-goal-driven dialogue response generation and use a Twitter Dialogue Corpus Ritter et al. (2011) based on public Twitter conversations. The dataset is split into training, validation and test sets, containing respectively 749,060, 93,633 and 10,000 dialogues each. Each dialogue contains on average 6.27 utterances (dialogue turns) and 94.16 words. The dialogues are substantially longer than recent large-scale language modelling corpora, such as the 1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark Chelba et al. (2014), which focus on modelling single sentences.

We use standard first-order gradient-descent optimizer Adam Kingma & Ba (2015). with learning rate 0.0002 and mini-batches of size 40 or 80. We use a variant of truncated back-propagation and apply gradient clipping Pascanu et al. (2012). Model selection and early stopping (the only additional form of regularization employed for this set of experiments) were conducted using the validation lower-bound, estimated using one stochastic sample per validation example. At test time, we use beam search with 5 beams for outputting responses with the RNN decoders. At the beginning of the beam search, a sample the latent variable is generated and conditioned on throughout the beam search. We fix the word embedding dimensionality to 400.

Baselines We compare to an LSTM RNN. We experiment with 1000, 2000 and 4000 hidden units (LSTM cells) and choose the architecture with 4000 hidden units based on the validation set log-likelihood.

We also compare to an HRED model. The HRED model encoder RNN has a bidirectional GRU RNN encoder, where the forward and backward RNNs each have 1000 hidden units. The encoder and context RNNs use layer normalization Ba et al. (2016). We experiment with 500 and 1000 hidden units for the context RNN and with 1000 and 2000 hidden units for the LSTM RNN decoder. Based on the validation set log-likelihood, we choose 1000 hidden units for both the context RNN and decoder RNN.

Human Evaluation Evaluating dialogue response generation models is difficult and open problem problem Galley et al. (2015); Pietquin & Hastie (2013); Schatzmann et al. (2005). Inspired by metrics used for evaluating machine translation and information retrieval systems, researchers have

adopted word-overlap metrics, such as the BLEU metric. However, it was recently shown across task domains that such metrics have little correlation with human evaluations of response quality Liu et al. (2016). These metrics are extremely sensitive to overlaps between pronouns and stopwords — as opposed to the core semantic content — which results in a critical bias and, thus, misleading conclusions. Similarly, information theoretic metrics such as word perplexity have also been criticized as inappropriate for evaluation Pietquin & Hastie (2013). We therefore carry out a human evaluation study to compare the responses from the different models.

# 7 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we proposed the multimodal variational encoder-decoder framework. In order to capture complex aspects of unknown data distributions, we developed the piecewise-constant prior, which can be efficiently and flexibly be adjusted to capture distributions with many modes, such as those over topics. In experiments on document modeling and dialogue modeling, we have shown the effectiveness of our framework in building models capable of learning richer structure from the data.

Future work includes exploration of our framework in other tasks key to natural language processing and generation as well as investigation of the effectiveness of our prior when additional side information is sometimes available, as in semi-supervised learning for tasks like document categorization Ororbia II et al..
