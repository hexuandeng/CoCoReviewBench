# ABSTRACT

Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance in many computer vision tasks. However, for most semantic segmentation (seg) and object detection (det) tasks, the backbone of the network directly reuses the network manually designed for classification tasks. Utilizing a network pre-trained on ImageNet as the backbone has been a popular practice for seg/det challenges. However, because of the gap between different tasks, adapting the network directly to the target task could bring performance promotion. Some recent neural architecture search (NAS) methods search for the backbone of seg/det networks. ImageNet pre-training of the search space representation or the searched network bears huge computational cost. In this paper, we propose a fast neural network adaptation method FNA, which can adapt the manually designed network on ImageNet to the new seg/det tasks efficiently. We adopt differentiable NAS to adapt the architecture of the network. We first expand the manually designed network to a super network which is the representation of the search space. Then we successively conduct the adaptation on the architecture-level and parameter-level. Our designed parameters-remapping paradigm accelerates the adaptation process. Our experiments include both seg and det tasks. We conduct adaptation on the MobileNetV2 network. FNA demonstrates performance promotion compared with both manually and NAS designed networks. The total computational cost of FNA is much less than many SOTA seg/det NAS methods,  $1737 \times$  less than DPC,  $6.8 \times$  less than Auto-DeepLab and  $7.4 \times$  less than DetNAS.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in recent years. Especially, they are widely applied in computer vision tasks, e.g., image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016; Howard et al., 2017), segmentation (Long et al., 2015; Ronneberger et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017b) and object detection (Ren et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; He et al., 2017), etc. Image classification always serves as a fundamental task for neural network designing. In general, one network elaborately designed and pre-trained on the classification task is directly used as the backbone of the segmentation or detection network. The fine-tuning technique is usually utilized to adapt the parameters of the backbone network to the new task. There is no doubt that the backbone plays an important role in segmentation or detection tasks. However, there is a gap between different tasks which leads to the different principles of architecture designing. For example, segmentation tasks focus on denser features of images and object detection tasks need to take both localization and classification information for each instance. Therefore, neural architectures designed for classification tasks do not suffice so well for segmentation or detection tasks. To tackle this problem, some works (Li et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019) propose to improve the backbone architecture designing for better performance on the target tasks.

Handcrafted neural architecture design is inefficient and may not find the best networks. Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) methods (Zoph et al., 2017; Pham et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; 2019b; Cai et al., 2019) aim at designing the architectures of DNNs automatically, which can alleviate the burden of human experts. Some works (Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019b) propose to use NAS methods to specialize in architecture designing for the backbones of segmentation or detection networks. However, pre-training has always been a non-negligible but costly procedure. Though it is demonstrated that pre-training is not so necessary recently (He et al.,

2018), training from scratch on the target task still takes more iterations than fine-tuning from the pre-trained model. In architecture search methods, pre-training becomes more intractable because there are millions of architectures in the search space. It is impractical to pre-train every backbone of the architectures. One-shot search methods (Brock et al., 2017; Bender et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019b) integrate all sub-architectures in one super network while pre-training the super network and the searched network both bears large computational cost.

As ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) pre-training has been an incredibly common manner in many computer vision tasks, there are lots of models trained on ImageNet available. To take full advantage of these models, we propose a fast neural network adaptation method (FNA) based on a parameters-remapping paradigm. Our method can adapt one network to a new task with low computational cost. Fig. 1 shows the whole framework. The adaptation acts both on the architecture- and parameters-level. We adopt the differentiable NAS method (Liu et al., 2019b; Wu et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019) to implement the architecture-level adaptation. We select a manually designed network (MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018) in our experiments) as the seed network, which is pre-trained on ImageNet. With the parameters-remapping paradigm, the seed network can be expanded into a super network which is the continuous representation of the search space. The new parameters in the super network can be initialized as one mapping of that in the seed network. Benefitting from the parameters-remapping paradigm, the differentiable architecture search process can be fast carried out directly on the target task. With the NAS based architecture adaptation, we obtain a new architecture targeted at the new task. Then we conduct adaptation on the parameter-level. Similarly, we remap the parameters of the seed network on the target network. Then the target network can be directly fine-tuned on the target task with no need for pre-training once more.

Our proposed FNA method aims at adapting the neural network to new tasks fast and efficiently. Based on the parameters-remapping mechanism, FNA takes full advantage of the pre-trained parameters of the seed network. The remapping acts on both the NAS process and parameters fine-tuning, which greatly degrades the computational cost of adaptation. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are demonstrated by experiments on both segmentation and detection tasks. We adapt the manually designed network MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018) to segmentation framework DeepLabv3 (Chen et al., 2017b), detection framework RetinaNet (Lin et al., 2017) and SSDLite (Liu et al., 2016; Sandler et al., 2018). Networks adapted by FNA surpass both manually designed and NAS searched networks in terms of both performance and model FLOPs. Compared to NAS methods, FNA takes much less computational cost,  $1737 \times$  less than DPC,  $6.8 \times$  less than Auto-DeepLab and  $7.4 \times$  less than DetNAS.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Neural Architecture Search With reinforcement learning (RL) and evolutionary algorithm (EA) being applied to NAS methods, many works (Zoph & Le, 2016; Zoph et al., 2017; Pham et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018; Real et al., 2018) make great progress in promoting the performances of neural networks. Recently, NAS methods based on one-shot model (Brock et al., 2017; Bender et al., 2018) or differentiable representations (Liu et al., 2019b; Cai et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2018) achieve remarkable results with low search cost. We use the differentiable NAS method to implement architecture adaptation, which adjusts the architecture of the backbone network automatically.

Backbone Design As deep neural network (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Szegedy et al., 2016; He et al., 2016) designing develops, the backbone of segmentation or detection evolves accordingly. Some works improve the backbone architectures by modifying existing networks. PeleeNet (Wang et al., 2018) proposes a variant of DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) for more efficient detection system on mobile devices. DetNet (Li et al., 2018) apply dilated convolution (Yu & Koltun, 2016) on the backbone to enlarge the receptive field. BiSeNet (Yu et al., 2018) and HRNet (Wang et al., 2019) design multiple paths to learn both high- and low- resolution representations. Some works (Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019b) employ NAS methods to design better backbone architectures.

Parameters Remapping Net2Net (Chen et al., 2015) proposes the function-preserving transformations to remap the parameters of one network to a new deeper or wider network. This remapping mechanism accelerates the training of the new larger network and achieves great performances. Following this manner, EAS (Cai et al., 2018) extends the parameters-remapping concept to neural architecture search. Moreover, some NAS works (Pham et al., 2018; Fang et al., 2019; Elsken et al.,

Figure 1: The framework of our proposed FNA. We select an artificially designed network as the seed network  $\mathcal{N}_s$ . Then we expand  $\mathcal{N}_s$  to a super network  $\mathcal{N}_{sup}$  which is a continuously relaxed representation of the search space. We utilize differentiable NAS method to start the architecture adaptation with the super network and then obtain an inner network  $\mathcal{N}_i$  with the target architecture. Finally, we adapt the parameters of  $\mathcal{N}_i$  to get the target network  $\mathcal{N}_t$ . The parameters of  $\mathcal{N}_s$  are remapped to both  $\mathcal{N}_{sup}$  and  $\mathcal{N}_i$ .

# 3 METHOD

The artificially-designed network MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018) has been widely used in many computer vision tasks because of its high performance and low FLOPs. In this paper, we select the MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018) network as the seed network for its generality. To adapt the network to segmentation and detection tasks, we adjust the architecture elements on three levels, i.e. convolution kernel size, depth and width of the network. In this section, we first describe the parameters-remapping paradigm. Then we explain the whole procedure of the network adaptation.

# 3.1 PARAMETERS REMAPPING

We define parameters-remapping as one paradigm which aims at mapping the parameters of one seed network to another one. We denote the seed network as  $\mathcal{N}_s$  and the new network as  $\mathcal{N}_n$ , whose parameters are denoted as  $W_s$  and  $W_n$  respectively. The remapping paradigm is illustrated in the following three aspects. The remapping on the depth-level is firstly carried out and the remapping on the kernel- and width- level is conducted simultaneously. Moreover, we study different remapping manners in the experiments.

Remapping on Depth-level We extend the depth settings in our adaptation process. In other word, we adjust the number of inverted residual blocks (Sandler et al., 2018) (MBCov) in every stage of the network. We assume that one stage in the seed network  $\mathcal{N}_s$  has  $l$  layers. Its parameters of each layer can be denoted as  $\{\pmb{W}_s^{(1)},\pmb{W}_s^{(2)},\dots,\pmb{W}_s^{(l)}\}$ . Similarly, we assume that the corresponding stage with  $m$  layers in the new network  $\mathcal{N}_n$  has parameters  $\{\pmb{W}_n^{(1)},\pmb{W}_n^{(2)},\dots,\pmb{W}_n^{(m)}\}$ . The remapping process on the depth-level is shown in Fig. 2(a). The parameters of layers in  $\mathcal{N}_n$  which also exit in  $\mathcal{N}_s$  are just copied from  $\mathcal{N}_s$ . The parameters of new layers are all copied from the last layer in the stage of  $\mathcal{N}_s$ . It is formulated as

$$
f (i) = \max  (i, l),
$$

$$
W _ {n} ^ {(i)} = W _ {s} ^ {(f (i))}, \quad \forall 1 \leq i \leq m. \tag {1}
$$

Remapping on Width-level In the MBConv block of MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018) network, the first point-wise convolution expands the low-dimensional features to a high dimension. This practice can be utilized for expanding the width and capacity of one neural network. We adapt

Figure 2: Our parameters are remapped on three levels. (a) shows the depth-level remapping. The parameters of existing corresponding layers are copied from the original network. The parameters of new layers are copied from the last layer in the original network. (b) shows the width-level remapping. For each channels-diminished dimension, the parameters are copied from the original existing ones. (c) shows the kernel-level remapping. The original parameters are mapped to the central part of the new larger kernel. The values of the other parameters are assigned with 0.

(c) Kernel level

the width of the network by setting smaller expansion ratios. We denote the parameters of the convolution in  $\mathcal{N}_s$  as  $W^s\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times q\times h\times w}$  and that in  $\mathcal{N}_n$  as  $W^n\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times s\times h\times w}$ , where  $r\leq p$  and  $s\leq q$ . As is shown in Fig. 2(b), on the width-level, we just map the first  $r / s$  channels of parameters in  $\mathcal{N}_s$  to the narrower one in  $\mathcal{N}_n$ . This remapping strategy is utilized for parameters sharing in EAT-NAS (Fang et al., 2019) as well. It can be formulated as

$$
\boldsymbol {W} _ {i, j,:,:} ^ {n} = \boldsymbol {W} _ {i, j,:,:} ^ {s}, \quad \forall 1 \leq i \leq r, 1 \leq j \leq s. \tag {2}
$$

Remapping on Kernel-level The kernel size is commonly set as  $3 \times 3$  in most artificially-designed networks. To expand the receptive field and capture more abundant features in segmentation and detection tasks, we introduce larger kernel size settings in the adaptation process. As Fig. 2(c) shows, to expand the  $3 \times 3$  kernel to a larger one, we assign the parameters of the central  $3 \times 3$  region in the large kernel with the values of the original  $3 \times 3$  kernel. The values of the other region surrounding the central part are assigned with 0. We denote the parameters of the original  $3 \times 3$  kernel as  $W^{3 \times 3}$  and the larger  $k \times k$  kernel as  $W^{k \times k}$ . The remapping process on kernel-level can be formulated as follows,

$$
\boldsymbol {W} _ {:,: h, w} ^ {k \times k} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \boldsymbol {W} _ {:,: h, w} ^ {3 \times 3} & \text {i f} (k - 3) / 2 <   h, w \leq (k + 3) / 2 \\ 0 & \text {o t h e r w i s e} \end{array} , \right. \tag {3}
$$

where  $h, w$  denote the indices of the spatial dimension. This design principle conforms to the function-preserving concept (Chen et al., 2015), which accelerates and stabilizes the optimization of the new network.

# 3.2 NEURAL NETWORK ADAPTATION

We divide our neural network adaptation into three steps. Fig. 1 demonstrates the whole adaptation procedure. We select MobileNetV2 as the seed network  $\mathcal{N}_s$ . Firstly, we expand the seed network to a super network which is the representation of the search space in the latter architecture adaptation process. Secondly, we utilize the differentiable NAS method to achieve network adaptation on the architecture-level and obtain an inner network  $\mathcal{N}_i$  with the target architecture. Finally, we adapt the parameters of the inner network and obtain the target network  $\mathcal{N}_t$ . The aforementioned parameters-remapping method is applied to both network expansion and parameters adaptation.

Network Expansion We expand the seed network to a super network by introducing more options for architecture elements. For every MBConv layer, we allow for more kernel size settings  $\{3,5,7\}$  and more expansion ratios  $\{3,6\}$ . As most differentiable NAS methods (Liu et al., 2019b; Cai et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2018) do, we set every layer as a weighted sum of all candidate operations.

$$
\bar {o} ^ {(i)} (x) = \sum_ {o \in O} \frac {\exp \left(\alpha_ {o} ^ {(i)}\right)}{\sum_ {o ^ {\prime} \in O} \exp \left(\alpha_ {o ^ {\prime}} ^ {(i)}\right)} o (x), \tag {4}
$$

where  $O$  denotes the operation set,  $\alpha_{o}^{i}$  denotes the architecture parameter of operation  $o$  in the  $i$ th layer, and  $x$  denotes the input tensor. We extend more layers in one stage in the network and add the identity connection to the operation set for depth adjustment. After expanding the architecture of the network, we remap the parameters of the seed network to the super network based on the paradigm illustrated in Sec. 3.1. This remapping strategy prevents the huge cost of ImageNet pre-training of the all the sub-networks or the super network.

Architecture Adaptation We start the differentiable NAS process with the expanded super network directly on the target task, e.g., semantic segmentation or object detection. We first fine-tune operation weights of the super network for some epochs on the training dataset. After the weights are sufficiently trained, we start alternating the optimization of operation weights  $w$  with  $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w}$  and architecture parameters  $\alpha$  with  $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \alpha}$ . To accelerate the search process and decouple the parameters of different sub-networks, we only sample one path in each iteration of operation weight optimization. We sample the path according to the distribution of architecture parameters. With the optimization finished, we use the architecture parameters  $\alpha$  to derive the target architecture.

Parameters Adaptation After architecture adaptation, we obtain an inner network  $\mathcal{N}_i$  with the architecture targeted at the new task. To accommodate the new segmentation or detection tasks, the target architecture becomes quite different from that of the seed network  $\mathcal{N}_s$  (which is primitively designed for the image classification task). Unlike conventional training strategy, we discard the cumbersome pre-training process of  $\mathcal{N}_i$  on ImageNet. We remap the parameters of  $\mathcal{N}_s$  to  $\mathcal{N}_i$  utilizing the method described in Sec. 3.1. Then we directly fine-tune  $\mathcal{N}_i$  on the target task and obtain the final target network  $\mathcal{N}_t$ .

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We select the ImageNet pre-trained MobileNetV2 model as the seed network and apply our FNA method on both semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. In this section, firstly we give the implementation details of our experiments; then we report and analyze the network adaptation results; finally, we perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the parameters-remapping paradigm and compare different parameters remapping implementations.

# 4.1 ADAPTATION ON SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION

The semantic segmentation experiments are conducted on the Cityscapes (Cordts et al., 2016) dataset, which contains 2975 images for the training and 500 for the validation dataset. The image size is  $1024 \times 2048$ . In the architecture adaptation process, we map the seed network to the super network, which is used as the backbone of DeepLabv3 (Chen et al., 2017b). The output feature map is down-sampled by the factor of 16. Depthwise-separable convolution is used in the ASPP module (Chen et al., 2017a;b). We randomly sample  $20\%$  images from the training set as the validation set for architecture parameters updating. The original validation set is not used in the search process. The image is first resized to  $512 \times 1024$  and  $321 \times 321$  patches are randomly cropped as the input data. The stages where the expansion ratio of MBConv is 6 in the original MobileNetV2 are searched and adjusted. We set the numbers of layers in each searched stage of the super network as  $\{4, 4, 6, 6, 4, 1\}$ . To optimize the FLOPs of the searched network, we define the loss function in search as  $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{task} + \lambda \log_{\tau}(\gamma \cdot cost)$ . The first term denotes the cross-entropy loss and the second term controls the FLOPs of the network. We set  $\lambda$  as  $9 \times 10^{-3}$ ,  $\tau$  as 45 and  $\gamma$  as 10. The search process takes 80 epochs in total. We set a warm-up stage in the first 5 epochs to linearly increase the learning rate from  $1 \times 10^{-4}$  to 0.02. Then, the learning rate decays to  $1 \times 10^{-3}$  with the cosine annealing schedule (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017). We use the SGD optimizer with 0.9 momentum and  $5 \times 10^{-4}$  weight decay for operation weights and the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with  $4 \times 10^{-5}$  weight decay and a fixed learning rate  $1 \times 10^{-3}$ . The architecture optimization starts after 30 epochs. The batch size is set as 16. The whole search process is conducted on a single V100 GPU and takes only 1.4 hours in total.

In the parameters adaptation process, we remap the parameters of original MobileNetV2 to the inner network obtained in the aforementioned architecture adaptation. The training data is cropped as a  $769 \times 769$  patch from the rescaled image. The scale is randomly selected from [0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0]. The random left-right flipping is used. We update the statistics of

the batch normalization (BN) (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) for 2000 iterations before the fine-tuning process. We use the same SGD optimizer as the search process. The learning rate linearly increases from  $1 \times 10^{-4}$  to 0.01 and then decays to 0 with the polynomial schedule. The batch size is set as 16. The whole parameters adaptation process is conducted on 4 TITAN-Xp GPUs and takes 100K iterations, which cost only 8.5 hours in total.

Our semantic segmentation results are shown in Tab. 1. The FNA network achieves  $76.6\%$  mIU on Cityscapes with DeepLabv3 (Chen et al., 2017b) framework,  $1.1\%$  better than the manually designed seed Network MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018) with fewer MAdds. Compared to a NAS method DPC (Chen et al., 2018a) (with MobileNetV2 as the backbone) which searches the multiscale module for semantic segmentation tasks, FNA gets  $0.9\%$  mIU promotion with 0.52B fewer MAdds. For fair comparison with Auto-DeepLab (Liu et al., 2019a) which searches the backbone architecture on DeepLabv3 and retransits the searched network on DeepLabv3+ (Chen et al., 2018b), we adapt the parameters of the inner network  $\mathcal{N}_i$  to DeepLabv3+ framework. Comparing to Auto-DeepLab-S, FNA achieves far better mIU with fewer MAdds, Params and training iterations. With the remapping mechanism, FNA only takes 35.8 GPU hours,  $1737\times$  less than DPC (Chen et al., 2018a) and  $6.8\times$  less than Auto-DeepLab (Liu et al., 2019a).

# 4.2 ADAPTATION ON OBJECT DETECTION

We further implement our FNA method to object detection tasks. We adapt the MobileNetV2 seed network to two commonly used detection systems, RetinaNet (Lin et al., 2017) and a lightweight one SSDLite (Liu et al., 2016; Sandler et al., 2018). The experiments are conducted on MS-COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014). Our implementation is based on the MMDetection (Chen et al., 2019a) framework. In the search process of architecture adaptation, we randomly sample  $50\%$  data from the original training set as the validation set. The depth settings in each searched stage are set as  $\{4,4,4,4,4,1\}$ . We describe more implementation details in the Appendix.

We demonstrate the results on object detection tasks in Tab. 3. In the RetinaNet (Lin et al., 2017) framework, we compare FNA with two manually designed networks, ShuffleNetV2-10 (Ma et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019b) and MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018). FNA achieves higher mAP with similar MAdds. We compare FNA with DetNAS (Chen et al., 2019b) which searches the backbone of detection network. FNA achieves  $0.6\%$  higher mAP with 1.64M fewer Params and 0.2B fewer MAdds. As shown in Tab. 4, our total computational cost is only  $13.5\%$  of DetNAS, while DetNAS requires a huge cost for ImageNet pre-training. We degrade the cost largely with the assistance of parameters remapping. Moreover, we implement our FNA method on SSDLite (Liu et al., 2016; Sandler et al., 2018) framework. In Tab. 3, FNA surpasses both the manually designed network MobileNetV2 and the NAS-searched network MnasNet-92, where MnasNet (Tan et al., 2018) takes around 3.8K GPU days to search for the backbone network on ImageNet. The specific cost FNA takes on SSDLite is shown in Tab. 4. It is difficult to train the small network due to the

simplification (Liu et al., 2019c). Therefore, experiments on SSDLite need long training schedule and take larger computational cost. The experimental results further demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of direct adaptation on the target task with parameters remapping.

# 4.3 EFFECTIVENESS OF PARAMETERS REMAPPING

To validate the effectiveness of the parameters remapping paradigm in our method, we carry out several experiments for ablation study. The experiments are conducted with the semantic segmentation framework DeepLabv3 (Chen et al., 2017b) on Cityscapes dataset (Cordts et al., 2016). In our FNA method, the parameters remapping is conducted on both stages of network expansion and parameters adaptation. To prove the importance of parameters remapping in FNA, we attempt to remove the parameters remapping process at the two stages. The parameters of the network without remapping will be initialized with random values based on the standard normal distribution. With parameters remapping applied on both stages, the adaptation achieves the best results in Tab. 5. Especially, the remapping operation on the parameters adaptation stage tends to have greater importance for the final performance.

To further evaluate the performance of parameters remapping on the parameters adaptation stage, we pre-train the inner network  $\mathcal{N}_i$  obtained in architecture adaptation on ImageNet. Then we fine-tune the ImageNet pre-trained network on the semantic segmentation task. All the other settings in the experiments are the same as FNA. It is worth noting that FNA even achieves higher mIoU by a narrow margin (0.1%) in Tab. 5. We conjecture that this may benefit from the regularization of parameters remapping in the parameters adaptation stage.

# 4.4 STUDY ON PARAMETERS REMAPPING

We explore more other methods of the parameters remapping paradigm. Similar to Sec. 4.3, all the experiments are conducted with DeepLabv3 (Chen et al., 2017b) framework on Cityscapes dataset (Cordts et al., 2016). We make exploration from the following respects. For simplicity, we denote the weights of the seed network and the new network on the remapping dimension (output / input channel),  $W_{s} = (W_{s}^{(1)}\ldots W_{s}^{(p)})$  and  $W_{n} = (W_{n}^{(1)}\ldots W_{n}^{(q)})$  where  $q \leq p$ .

Remapping with BN Statistics on Width-level We review the formulation of batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) as follows,

$$
y _ {i} \leftarrow \gamma \frac {x _ {i} - \mu_ {\mathcal {B}}}{\sqrt {\sigma_ {\mathcal {B}} ^ {2} + \epsilon}} + \beta , \tag {5}
$$

# Algorithm 1: Weights Remapping Function

Input: the seed weights  $\mathbf{W}_s$  and the new weights  $\mathbf{W}_n$ , the reference vector  $\mathbf{v}$

1 // get indices of topk values of the vector  
2  $\pmb{a} \gets \text{topk-indices}(\pmb{v}, k = q)$  
3 // sort the indices  
4 sort(a)  
5 for  $i\in 1,2,\ldots ,q$  do  
6  $W_{n}^{(i)} = W_{s}^{(\boldsymbol{a}^{(i)})}$  
7 end

Output:  $W_{n}$  with remapped values

Figure 3: Parameters remapping on the kernel-level with a dilation setting.

where  $x_{i} = (x_{i}^{(1)}\ldots x_{i}^{(p)})$  denotes the  $p$ -dimensional input tensor of the  $i$ th layer,  $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^p$  denotes the learnable parameter which scales the normalized data on the channel dimension. We compute the absolute values of  $\gamma$  as  $|\gamma| = (|\gamma^{(1)}| \dots |\gamma^{(p)}|)$ . When remapping the parameters on the width-level, we sort the values of  $|\gamma|$  and map the parameters with the sorted top-  $q$  indices. More specifically, we define a weights remapping function in Algo. 1, where the reference vector is  $|\gamma|$ .

Remapping with Weight Importance on Width-level We attempt to utilize a canonical form of convolution weights to measure the importance of parameters. Then we remap the seed network parameters with great importance to the new network. The remapping operation is conducted based on Algo. 1 as well. We experiment with two canonical forms of weights to compute the reference vector, the standard deviation of  $\mathbf{W}_s$  as  $(std(\mathbf{W}_s^{(1)})\dots std(\mathbf{W}_s^{(p)}))$  and the  $L^1$  norm of  $\mathbf{W}_s$  as  $(||\mathbf{W}_s^{(1)}||_1\ldots ||\mathbf{W}_s^{(p)}||_1)$ .

Remapping with Dilation on Kernel-level We experiment with another method of parameters remapping on kernel-level. Different from the function-preserving method defined in Sec. 3.1, we remap the parameters with a dilation manner as shown in Fig. 7. The values in the convolution kernel without remapping are all assigned as 0. It is formulated as

$$
\boldsymbol {W} _ {:; h, w} ^ {k \times k} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \boldsymbol {W} _ {:; h, w} ^ {3 \times 3} & \text {i f} h, w = 1 + i \cdot \frac {k - 1}{2} \text {a n d} i = 0, 1, 2 \\ 0 & \text {o t h e r w i s e} \end{array} , \right. \tag {6}
$$

where  $\pmb{W}^{k\times k}$  and  $\pmb{W}^{3\times 3}$  denote the weights of the new network and the seed network,  $h,w$  denote the spatial indices.

Tab. 6 shows the experimental results. The network adaptation with the parameters remapping paradigm define in FNA achieves the best results. Furthermore, the remapping operation of FNA is easier to implement compared to the several aforementioned ones. However, we explore limited numbers of methods to implement the parameters-remapping paradigm. How to conduct the remapping strategy remains to be a significant future work.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose a fast neural network adaptation method (FNA) with a parameters remapping paradigm. We adapt the manually designed network MobileNetV2 to semantic segmentation and detection tasks on both architecture- and parameter- level. The parameters-remapping strategy takes full advantage of the seed network parameters, which accelerates both the architecture search and parameters fine-tuning process greatly. With our FNA method, researchers and engineers could fast adapt more manually designed networks to the backbone of various frameworks on different tasks. As there are lots of ImageNet pre-trained models available in the community, we could conduct adaptation with little cost and do more applications, e.g., face recognition, pose estimation, depth estimation, etc. We leave more efficient remapping strategies and more applications for future work.
