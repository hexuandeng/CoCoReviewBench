# ABSTRACT

Convolutional neural networks often dominate fully-connected counterparts in generalization performance, especially on image classification tasks. This is often explained in terms of "better inductive bias." However, this has not been made mathematically rigorous, and the hurdle is that the fully connected net can always simulate the convolutional net (for a fixed task). Thus the training algorithm plays a role. The current work describes a natural task on which a provable sample complexity gap can be shown, for standard training algorithms. We construct a single natural distribution on  $\mathbb{R}^d \times \{\pm 1\}$  on which any orthogonal-invariant algorithm (i.e. fully-connected networks trained with most gradient-based methods from gaussian initialization) requires  $\Omega(d^2)$  samples to generalize while  $O(1)$  samples suffice for convolutional architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate a single target function, learning which on all possible distributions leads to an  $O(1)$  vs  $\Omega(d^2/\varepsilon)$  gap. The proof relies on the fact that SGD on fully-connected network is orthogonal equivariant. Similar results are achieved for  $\ell_2$  regression and adaptive training algorithms, e.g. Adam and AdaGrad, which are only permutation equivariant.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep convolutional nets ("ConvNets") are at the center of the deep learning revolution (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017). For many tasks, especially in vision, convolutional architectures perform significantly better their fully-connected ("FC") counterparts, at least given the same amount of training data. Practitioners explain this phenomenon at an intuitive level by pointing out that convolutional architectures have better "inductive bias", which intuitively means the following: (i) ConvNet is a better match to the underlying structure of image data, and thus are able to achieve low training loss with far fewer parameters (ii) models with fewer total number of parameters generalize better.

Surprisingly, the above intuition about the better inductive bias of ConvNets over FC nets has never been made mathematically rigorous. The natural way to make it rigorous would be to show explicit learning tasks that require far more training samples on FC nets than for ConvNets. (Here "task"means, as usual in learning theory, a distribution on datapoints, and binary labels for them generated given using a fixed labeling function.) Surprisingly, the standard repertoire of lower bound techniques in ML theory does not seem capable of demonstrating such a separation. The reason is that any ConvNet can be simulated by an FC net of sufficient width, since a training algorithm can just zero out unneeded connections and do weight sharing as needed. Thus the key issue is not an expressiveness per se, but the combination of architecture plus the training algorithm. But if the training algorithm must be accounted for, the usual hurdle arises that we lack good mathematical understanding of the dynamics of deep net training (whether FC or ConvNet). How then can one establish the limitations of "FC nets + current training algorithms"? (Indeed, many lower bound techniques in PAC learning theory are information theoretic and ignore the training algorithm.)

The current paper makes significant progress on the above problem by exhibiting simple tasks that require  $\Omega(d^2)$  factor more training samples for FC nets than for ConvNets, where  $d$  is the data dimension. (In fact this is shown even for 1-dimensional ConvNets; the lower bound easily extends to 2-D ConvNets.) The lower bound holds for FC nets trained with any of the popular algorithms listed in Table 1. (The reader can concretely think of vanilla SGD with Gaussian initialization of

Figure 1: Illustration of generalization performance of convolutional versus fully-connected models trained by SGD. Here the input data are  $3 \times 32 \times 32$  three-channel images and the binary label indicates for each image whether the first channel has larger  $\ell_2$  norm than the second one. The input images are drawn from entry-wise independent Gaussian (left) and CIFAR-10 (right). In both cases, the convolutional net consists of a  $3 \times 3$  convolution with 10 hidden channel + quadratic activation +  $3 \times 3$  convolution with a single output channel + global average pooling, and the fully-connected net consists of a fully-connected layer with 3072 hidden nodes + quadratic activation + a fully-connected layer with a single node.

network weights, though the proof allows use of momentum,  $\ell_2$  regularization, and various learning rate schedules.) Our proof relies on the fact that these popular algorithms lead to an orthogonal-equivalence property on the trained FC nets, which says that at the end of training the FC net —no matter how deep or how wide — will make the same predictions even if we apply orthogonal transformation on all datapoints (i.e., both training and test). This notion is inspired by Ng (2004) (where it is named "orthogonal invariant"), which showed the power of logistic regression with  $\ell_1$  regularization versus other learners. For a variety of learners (including kernels and FC nets) that paper described explicit tasks where the learner has  $\Omega(d)$  higher sample complexity than logistic regression with  $\ell_1$  regularization. The lower bound example and technique can also be extended to show a (weak) separation between FC nets and ConvNets. (See Section 4.2)

Our separation is quantitatively stronger than the result one gets using Ng (2004) because the sample complexity gap is  $\Omega(d^2)$  vs  $O(1)$ , and not  $\Omega(d)$  vs  $O(1)$ . But in a more subtle way our result is conceptually far stronger: the technique of Ng (2004) seems incapable of exhibiting a sample gap of more than  $O(1)$  between Convnets and FC nets in our framework. The reason is that the technique of Ng (2004) can exhibit a hard task for FC nets only after fixing the training algorithm. But there are infinitely many training algorithms once we account for hyperparameters associated in various epochs with LR schedules,  $\ell_2$  regularizer and momentum. Thus Ng (2004)'s technique cannot exclude the possibility that the hard task for "FC net + Algorithm 1" is easy for "FC net + Algorithm 2". Note that we do not claim any issues with the results claimed in Ng (2004); merely that the technique cannot lead to a proper separation between ConvNets and FC nets, when the FC nets are allowed to be trained with any of the infinitely many training algorithms. (Section 4.2 spells out in more detail the technical difference between our technique and Ng's idea.)

The reader may now be wondering what is the single task that is easy for ConvNets but hard for FC nets trained with any standard algorithm? A simple example is the following: data distribution in  $\mathbb{R}^d$  is standard Gaussian, and target labeling function is the sign of  $\sum_{i=1}^{d/2} x_i^2 - \sum_{i=d/2+1}^{d} x_i^2$ . Figure 1 shows that this task is indeed much more difficult for FC nets. Furthermore, the task is also hard in practice for data distributions other than Gaussian; the figure shows that a sizeable performance gap exists even on CIFAR images with such a target label.

Extension to broader class of algorithms. The orthogonal-equivariance property holds for many types of practical training algorithms, but not all. Notable exceptions are adaptive gradient methods (e.g. Adam and AdaGrad),  $\ell_1$  regularizer, and initialization methods that are not spherically symmetric. To prove a lower bound against FC nets with these algorithms, we identify a property, permutation-invariance, which is satisfied by nets trained using such algorithms. We then demonstrate a single and natural task on  $\mathbb{R}^d \times \{\pm 1\}$  that resembles real-life image texture classification, on which we prove any permutation-invariant learning algorithm requires  $\Omega(d)$  training examples to generalize, while Empirical Risk Minimization with  $O(1)$  examples can learn a convolutional net.

Paper structure. In Section 2 we discuss about related works. In section 3, we define the notation and terminologies. In Section 4, we give two warmup examples and an overview for the proof technique for the main theorem. In Section 5, we present our main results on the lower bound of orthogonal and permutation equivariant algorithms.

# 2 RELATED WORKS

Du et al. (2018) attempted to investigate the reason why convolutional nets are more sample efficient. Specifically they prove  $O(1)$  samples suffice for learning a convolutional filter and also proved a  $\Omega(d)$  min-max lower bound for learning the class of linear classifiers. Their lower bound is against learning a class of distributions, and their work fails to serve as a sample complexity separation, because their upper and lower bounds are proved on different classes of tasks.

Arjevani & Shamir (2016) also considered the notion of distribution-specific hardness of learning neural nets. They focused on proving running time complexity lower bounds against so-called "orthogonally invariant" and "linearly invariant" algorithms. However, here we focus on sample complexity.

Recently, there has been progress in showing lower bounds against learning with kernels. Wei et al. (2019) constructed a single task on which they proved a sample complexity separation between learning with neural networks vs. with neural tangent kernels. Notably the lower bound is specific to neural tangent kernels (Jacot et al., 2018). Relatedly, Allen-Zhu & Li (2019) showed a sample complexity lower bound against all kernels for a family of tasks, i.e., learning  $k$ -XOR on the hypercube.

# 3 NOTATION AND PRELIMINARIES

We will use  $\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d$ ,  $\mathcal{Y} = \{-1,1\}$  to denote the domain of the data and label and  $\mathcal{H} = \{h \mid h : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}\}$  to denote the hypothesis class. Formally, given a joint distribution  $P$ , the error of a hypothesis  $h \in \mathcal{H}$  is defined as  $\mathrm{err}_P(h) := \mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{x},y \sim P}[h(\mathbf{x}) \neq y]$ . If  $h$  is a random hypothesis, we define  $\mathrm{err}_P(h) := \mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{x},y \sim P,h}[h(\mathbf{x}) \neq y]$  for convenience. A class of joint distributions supported on  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$  is referred as a problem,  $\mathcal{P}$ .

We use  $\| \cdot \| _2$  to denote the spectrum norm and  $\| \cdot \| _F$  to denote the Frobenius norm of a matrix. We use  $A\leq B$  to denote that  $B - A$  is a semi-definite positive matrix. We also use  $\mathcal{O}(d)$  and  $\mathcal{G}\mathcal{L}(d)$  to denote the  $d$ -dimensional orthogonal group and general linear group respectively. We use  $B_{p}^{d^{2}}$  to denote the unit Schatten-  $p$  norm ball in  $\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ .

We use  $N(\mu, \Sigma)$  to denote Gaussian distribution with mean  $\mu$  and covariance  $\Sigma$ . For random variable  $X$  and  $Y$ , we denote  $X$  is equal to  $Y$  in distribution by  $X \stackrel{d}{=} Y$ . In this work, we also always use  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$  to denote the distributions on  $\mathcal{X}$  and  $P$  to denote the distributions supported jointly on  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$ . Given an input distribution  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$  and a hypothesis  $h$ , we define  $P_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond h$  as the joint distribution on  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$ , such that  $(P_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond h)(S) = P(\{\mathbf{x} | (\mathbf{x}, h(\mathbf{x})) \in S\})$ ,  $\forall S \subset \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$ . In other words, to sample  $(X, Y) \sim P_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond h$  means to first sample  $X \sim P_{\mathcal{X}}$ , and then set  $Y = h(X)$ . For a family of input distributions  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{X}}$  and a hypothesis class  $\mathcal{H}$ , we define  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond \mathcal{H} = \{P_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond h \mid P_{\mathcal{X}} \in \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{X}}, h \in \mathcal{H}\}$ . In this work all joint distribution  $P$  can be written as  $P_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond h$  for some  $h$ , i.e.  $P_{\mathcal{Y}|\mathcal{X}}$  is deterministic.

For set  $S \subset \mathcal{X}$  and 1-1 map  $g: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X}$ , we define  $g(S) = \{g(x) | x \in S\}$ . We use  $\circ$  to denote function composition.  $(f \circ g)(x)$  is defined as  $f(g(x))$ , and for function class  $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G}, \mathcal{F} \circ \mathcal{G} = \{f \circ g | f \in \mathcal{F}, g \in \mathcal{G}\}$ . For any distribution  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$  supported on  $\mathcal{X}$ , we define  $P_{\mathcal{X}} \circ g$  as the distribution such that  $(P_{\mathcal{X}} \circ g)(S) = P_{\mathcal{X}}(g(S))$ . In other words, if  $X \sim P_{\mathcal{X}} \Longleftrightarrow g^{-1}(X) \sim P_{\mathcal{X}} \circ g$ , because

$$
\forall S \subseteq \mathcal {X}, \quad \underset {X \sim P _ {\mathcal {X}}} {\mathbb {P}} \left[ g ^ {- 1} (X) \in S \right] = \underset {X \sim P _ {\mathcal {X}}} {\mathbb {P}} \left[ X \in g (S) \right] = [ P _ {\mathcal {X}} \circ g ] (S).
$$

For any joint distribution  $P$  of form  $P = P_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond h$ , we define  $P \circ g = (P_{\mathcal{X}} \circ g) \diamond (h \circ g)$ . In other words,  $(X,Y) \sim P \Longleftrightarrow (g^{-1}(X),Y) \sim P \circ g$ . For any distribution class  $\mathcal{P}$  and group  $\mathcal{G}$  acting on  $\mathcal{X}$ , we define  $\mathcal{P} \circ \mathcal{G}$  as  $\{P \circ g \mid P \in \mathcal{P}, g \in \mathcal{G}\}$ .

Definition 3.1. A deterministic supervised Learning Algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  is a mapping from a sequence of training data,  $\{(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n\in (\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y})^n$ , to a hypothesis  $\mathcal{A}(\{(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n)\in \mathcal{H}\subseteq \mathcal{Y}^\mathcal{X}$ . The algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  could also be randomized, in which case the output  $\mathcal{A}(\{(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n)$  is a distribution on

Definition 3.2 (Equivariant Algorithms). A learning algorithm is equivariant under group  $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{X}}$  (or  $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{X}}$ -equivariant) if and only if for any dataset  $\{\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^n \in (\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y})^n$  and  $\forall g \in \mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{X}}, \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ ,  $\mathcal{A}(\{g(\mathbf{x}_i), y_i\}_{i=1}^n) \circ g = \mathcal{A}(\{\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^n)$ , or  $\mathcal{A}(\{g(\mathbf{x}_i), y_i\}_{i=1}^n)(g(\mathbf{x})) = [\mathcal{A}(\{\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^n)](\mathbf{x})$ .<sup>1</sup>

Definition 3.3 (Sample Complexity). Given a problem  $\mathcal{P}$  and a randomized learning algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ ,  $\delta, \varepsilon \in [0,1]$ , we define the  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -sample complexity, denoted  $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \varepsilon, \delta)$ , as the smallest number  $n \in \times$  such that  $\forall P \in \mathcal{P}$ , w.p.  $1 - \delta$  over the randomness of  $\{\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ ,  $\mathrm{err}_P(\mathcal{A}(\{\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^n)) \leq \varepsilon$ . We also define the  $\varepsilon$ -expected sample complexity for a problem  $\mathcal{P}$ , denoted  $\mathcal{N}^*(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \varepsilon)$ , as the smallest number  $n \in \mathbb{N}$  such that  $\forall P \in \mathcal{P}$ ,  $\underset{(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) \sim P}{\mathbb{E}}[\mathrm{err}_P(\mathcal{A}(\{\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^n))] \leq \varepsilon$ . By definition, we

have  $\mathcal{N}^{*}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon +\delta)\leq \mathcal{N}^{*}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon ,\delta)\leq \mathcal{N}^{*}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon \delta),\forall \varepsilon ,\delta \in [0,1].$

# 3.1 PARAMETRIC MODELS AND ITERATIVE ALGORITHMS

A parametric model  $\mathcal{M}:\mathcal{W}\to \mathcal{H}$  is a functional mapping from weight  $\mathbf{W}$  to a hypothesis  $\mathcal{M}(\cdot):\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ . Given a specific parametric model  $\mathcal{M}$ , a general iterative algorithm is defined as Algorithm 1. In this work, we will only use the two parametric models below, FC-NN and CNN.

FC Nets: A  $L$ -layer Fully-connected Neural Network parameterized by its weights  $\mathbf{W} = (W_{1}, W_{2}, \ldots, W_{L})$  is a function FC-NN[·]:  $\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ , where  $W_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i-1} \times d_{i}}$ ,  $d_{0} = d$ , and  $d_{L} = 1$ :

$$
\mathsf {F C} - \mathsf {N N} [ \mathbf {W} ] (\mathbf {x}) = W _ {L} \sigma \left(W _ {L - 1} \dots \sigma \left(W _ {2} \sigma \left(W _ {1} \mathbf {x}\right)\right)\right).
$$

Here,  $\sigma : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$  can be any function, and we abuse the notation such that  $\sigma$  is also defined for vector inputs, in the sense that  $[\sigma(\mathbf{x})]_i = \sigma(x_i)$ .

ConvNets(CNN): In this paper we will only use two layer Convolutional Neural Networks with one channel. Suppose  $d = d' r$  for some integer  $d', r$ , a 2-layer CNN parameterized by its weights  $\mathbf{W} = (\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{a}, b) \in \mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^r \times \mathbb{R}$  is a function  $\mathbf{CNN}[\cdot] : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ :

$$
\mathsf {C N N} [ \mathbf {W} ] (\mathbf {x}) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {r} a _ {r} \sigma ([ \mathbf {w} * \mathbf {x} ] _ {d ^ {\prime} (r - 1) + 1: d ^ {\prime} r}) + b,
$$

where  $*: \mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$  is the convolution operator, defined as  $[\mathbf{w}*\mathbf{x}]_i = \sum_{j=1}^k w_j x_{[i-j-1 \bmod d]+1}$ , and  $\sigma: \mathbb{R}^{d'} \to \mathbb{R}$  is the composition of pooling and element-wise non-linearity.

# 3.2 EQUIVARIANCE AND TRAINING ALGORITHMS

This section gives an informal sketch of why FC nets trained with standard algorithms have certain equivariance properties. The high level idea here is if update rule of the network, or more generally, the parametrized model, exhibits certain symmetry per step, i.e., property 2 in Theorem C.1, then by induction it will hold till the last iteration.

Taking linear regression as an example, let  $\mathbf{x}_i\in \mathbb{R}^d,i\in [n]$  be the data and  $\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^n$  be the labels, the GD update for  $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(\mathbf{x}_i^\top \mathbf{w} - y_i)^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left\| \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{w} - \mathbf{y}\right\| _2^2$  would be  $\mathbf{w}_{t + 1} = F(\mathbf{w}_t,\mathbf{X},\mathbf{y}):= \mathbf{w}_t - \eta \mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{w}_t - \mathbf{y})$ . Now suppose there's another person trying to solve the same

problem using GD with the same initial linear function, but he observes everything in a different basis, i.e.,  $\mathbf{X}' = U\mathbf{X}$  and  $\mathbf{w}_0' = U\mathbf{w}_0$ , for some orthogonal matrix  $U$ . Not surprisingly, he would get the same solution for GD, just in a different basis. Mathematically, this is because  $\mathbf{w}_t' = U\mathbf{w}_t \Rightarrow \mathbf{w}_{t+1}' = F(\mathbf{w}_t', U\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}) = UF(\mathbf{w}_t, \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}) = U\mathbf{w}_{t+1}$ . In other words, he would make the same prediction for unseen data. Thus if the initial distribution of  $\mathbf{w}_0$  is the same under all basis (i.e., under rotations), e.g., gaussian  $N(0, I_d)$ , then  $\mathbf{w}_0 \stackrel{d}{=} U\mathbf{w}_0 \Rightarrow F^t(\mathbf{w}_0, U\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}) = UF^t(\mathbf{w}_0, \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y})$ , for any iteration  $t$ , which means GD for linear regression is orthogonal invariant.

To show orthogonal equivariance for gradient descent on general deep FC nets, it suffices to apply the above argument on each neuron in the first layer of the FC nets. Equivalence for other training algorithms (see Table 1) can be derived in the exact same method. The rigorous statement and the proofs are deferred into Appendix C.

# 4 WARM-UP EXAMPLES AND PROOF OVERVIEW

# 4.1 EXAMPLE 1:  $\Omega(d)$  LOWER BOUND AGAINST ORTHOGONAL EQUIVARIANT METHODS

We start with a simple but insightful example to how equivariance alone could suffice for some non-trivial lower bounds.

We consider a task on  $\mathbb{R}^d\times \{\pm 1\}$  which is a uniform distribution on the set  $\{(\mathbf{e}_iy,y)|i\in$ $\{1,2,\ldots ,d\} ,y = \pm 1\}$ , denoted by  $P$ . Each sample from  $P$  is a one-hot vector in  $\mathbb{R}^d$  and the sign of the non-zero coordinate determines its label. Now imagine our goal is to learn this task using an algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ . After observing a training set of  $n$  labeled points  $S\coloneqq \{(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n$ , the algorithm is asked to make a prediction on an unseen test data  $\mathbf{x}$ , i.e.,  $\mathcal{A}(S)(\mathbf{x})$ . Here we are concerned with orthogonal equivariant algorithms —the prediction of the algorithm on the test point remains the same even if we rotate every  $x_{i}$  and the test point  $x$  by any orthogonal matrix  $R$ , i.e.,

$$
\mathcal {A} \left(\left\{\left(R \mathbf {x} _ {i}, y _ {i}\right) \right\} _ {i = 1} ^ {n}\right) (R \mathbf {x}) \stackrel {{d}} {{=}} \mathcal {A} \left(\left\{\left(\mathbf {x} _ {i}, y _ {i}\right) \right\} _ {i = 1} ^ {n}\right) (\mathbf {x})
$$

Now we show this algorithm fails to generalize on task  $P$ , if it observes only  $d / 2$  training examples. The main idea here is that, for a fixed training set  $S$ , the prediction  $\mathcal{A}(\{\left(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i\right)\}_{i = 1}^n)(\mathbf{x})$  is determined solely by the inner products between  $\mathbf{x}$  and  $\mathbf{x}_i$ 's due to orthogonal equivariance, i.e., there exists a random function  $f$  (which may depend on  $S$ ) such that

$$
\mathcal {A} (\{\left(\mathbf {x} _ {i}, y _ {i}\right) \} _ {i = 1} ^ {n}) (\mathbf {x}) \stackrel {{d}} {{=}} f (\mathbf {x} ^ {\top} \mathbf {x} _ {1}, \dots , \mathbf {x} ^ {\top} \mathbf {x} _ {n})
$$

But the input distribution for this task is supported on 1-hot vectors. Suppose  $n < d / 2$ . Then at test time the probability is at least  $1 / 2$  that the new data point  $(\mathbf{x},y)\sim P$ , is such that  $\mathbf{x}$  has zero inner product with all  $n$  points seen in the training set  $S$ . This fact alone fixes the prediction of  $\mathcal{A}$  to the value  $f(0,\dots ,0)$  whereas  $y$  is independently and randomly chosen to be  $\pm 1$ . We conclude that  $\mathcal{A}$  outputs the wrong answer with probability at least  $1 / 4$ .

# 4.2 EXAMPLE 2:  $\Omega(d^2)$  LOWER BOUND IN THE WEAK SENSE

The warm up example illustrates the main insight of (Ng, 2004), namely, that when an orthogonal equivariant algorithm is used to do learning on a certain task, it is actually being forced to simultaneously learn all orthogonal transformations of this task. Intuitively, this should make the learning much more sample-hungry compared to even Simple SGD on ConvNets, which is not orthogonal equivariant. Now we sketch why the obvious way to make this intuition precise using VC dimension (Theorem B.1) does not give a proper separation between ConvNets and FC nets, as mentioned in the Introduction.

We first fix the ground truth labeling function  $h^* = \mathrm{sign}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i^2 - \sum_{i=d+1}^{2d} x_i^2\right]$ . Algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  is orthogonal equivariant (Definition 3.2) means that for any task  $P = P_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond h^*$ , where  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$  is the input distribution and  $h^*$  is the labeling function,  $\mathcal{A}$  must have the same performance on  $P$  and its rotated version  $P \circ U = (P_{\mathcal{X}} \circ U) \diamond (h^* \circ U)$ , where  $U$  can be any orthogonal matrix. Therefore if there's an orthogonal equivariant learning algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  that learns  $h^*$  on all distributions, then  $\mathcal{A}$  will also learn every the rotated copy of  $h^*$ ,  $h^* \circ U$ , on every distribution  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$ , simply because  $\mathcal{A}$  learns  $h^*$  on distribution  $P_{\mathcal{X}} \circ U^{-1}$ . Thus  $\mathcal{A}$  learns the class of labeling functions  $h^* \circ \mathcal{O}(d) := \{h(\mathbf{x}) = h^*(U(\mathbf{x})) \mid U \in \mathcal{O}(d)\}$  on all distributions. (See formal statement in Theorem 5.1) By the standard lower bounds with VC dimension (See Theorem B.1), it takes at least  $\Omega\left(\frac{\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H} \circ \mathcal{O}(d))}{\varepsilon}\right)$  samples for  $\mathcal{A}$  to guarantee  $1 - \varepsilon$  accuracy. Thus it suffices to show the VC dimension  $\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H} \circ \mathcal{O}(d)) = \Omega(d^2)$ , towards a  $\Omega(d^2)$  sample complexity lower bound. (Ng (2004) picks a linear thresholding function as  $h^*$ , and thus  $\mathrm{VCdim}(h^* \circ \mathcal{O}(d))$  is only  $O(d)$ .)

Formally, we have the following theorem, whose proof is deferred into appendix:

Theorem 4.1 (All distributions, single hypothesis). Let  $\mathcal{P} = \{\text{all distributions}\} \diamond \{h^*\}$ . For any orthogonal equivariant algorithms  $\mathcal{A}$ ,  $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon,\delta) = \Omega((d^2 + \ln \frac{1}{\delta}) / \varepsilon)$ , while there's a 2-layer ConvNet architecture, such that  $\mathcal{N}(\mathsf{ERM}_{\mathsf{CNN}},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon,\delta) = O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\left(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon} + \log \frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$ .

But as noted in the introduction, this doesn't imply there is some task hard for every training algorithm for the FC net. The VC dimension based lower bound implies for each algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  the existence of a fixed distribution  $P_{\mathcal{X}} \in \mathcal{P}$  and some orthogonal matrix  $U_{\mathcal{A}}$  such that the task  $(P_{\mathcal{X}} \circ U_{\mathcal{A}}^{-1}) \diamond h^{*}$  is hard for it. However, this does not preclude  $(P_{\mathcal{X}} \circ U_{\mathcal{A}}^{-1}) \diamond h^{*}$  being easy for some other algorithm  $\mathcal{A}'$ .

# 4.3 PROOF OVERVIEW FOR FIXED DISTRIBUTION LOWER BOUNDS

At first sight, the issue highlighted above (and in the Introduction) seems difficult to get around. One possible avenue is if the hard input distribution  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$  in the task were invariant under all orthogonal transformations, i.e.,  $P_{\mathcal{X}} = P_{\mathcal{X}} \circ U$  for all orthogonal matrices  $U$ . Unfortunately, the distribution constructed in the proof of lower bound with VC dimension is inherently discrete and cannot be made invariant to orthogonal transformations.

Our proof will use a fixed  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$  namely, the standard Gaussian, which is indeed invariant under orthogonal transformations. The proof also uses the Benedek-Itai's lower bound, Theorem 4.2, and the main technical part of our proof is the lower bound for the packing number  $D(\mathcal{H}, \rho, \varepsilon)$  defined below (also see Equation (2)).

For function class  $\mathcal{H}$ , we use  $\Pi_{\mathcal{H}}(n)$  to denote the growth function of  $\mathcal{H}$ , i.e.  $\Pi_{\mathcal{H}}(n) := \sup_{x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathcal{X}} |\{(h(x_1), h(x_2), \ldots, h(x_n)) | h \in \mathcal{H}\}|$ . Denote the VC-Dimension of  $\mathcal{H}$  by  $\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})$ ,

by Sauer-Shelah Lemma, we know  $\Pi_{\mathcal{H}}(n) \leq \left(\frac{en}{\operatorname{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})}\right)^{\operatorname{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})}$  for  $n \geq \operatorname{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})$ .

Let  $\rho$  be a metric on  $\mathcal{H}$ , We define  $N(\mathcal{H},\rho ,\varepsilon)$  as the  $\varepsilon$ -covering number of  $\mathcal{H}$  w.r.t.  $\rho$ , and  $D(\mathcal{H},\rho ,\varepsilon)$  as the  $\varepsilon$ -packing number of  $\mathcal{H}$  w.r.t.  $\rho$ . For distribution  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$ , we use  $\rho_{\mathcal{X}}(h,h^{\prime})\coloneqq \mathbb{P}_{X\sim P_{\mathcal{X}}}[h(X)\neq h^{\prime}(X)]$  to denote the discrepancy between hypothesis  $h$  and  $h^\prime$  w.r.t.  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$ .

Theorem 4.2. [Benedek-Itai's lower bound] For any algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  that  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -learns  $\mathcal{H}$  with  $n$  i.i.d. samples from a fixed, it must hold for every

$$
\Pi_ {\mathcal {H}} (n) \geq (1 - \delta) D (\mathcal {H}, \rho_ {\mathcal {X}}, 2 \varepsilon) \tag {1}
$$

Since  $\Pi_{\mathcal{H}}(n) \leq 2^n$ , we have  $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{A}, P_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond \mathcal{H}, \varepsilon, \delta) \geq \log_2 D(\mathcal{H}, \rho_{\mathcal{X}}, 2\varepsilon) + \log_2 (1 - \delta)$ , which is the original bound from Benedek & Itai (1991). Later Long (1995) improved this bound for the regime  $n \geq \mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})$  using Sauer-Shelah lemma, i.e.,

$$
\mathcal {N} (\mathcal {A}, P _ {\mathcal {X}}, \varepsilon , \delta) \geq \frac {\operatorname {V C d i m} (\mathcal {H})}{e} ((1 - \delta) D (\mathcal {H}, \rho_ {\mathcal {X}}, 2 \varepsilon)) ^ {\frac {1}{\operatorname {V C d i m} (\mathcal {H})}}. \tag {2}
$$

Intuition behind Benedek-Itai's lower bound. We first fix the data distribution as  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$ . Suppose the  $2\varepsilon$ -packing is labeled as  $\{h_1, \ldots, h_{D(\mathcal{H}, \rho_{\mathcal{X}}, 2\varepsilon)}\}$  and ground truth is chosen from this  $2\varepsilon$ -packing,  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -learns the hypothesis  $\mathcal{H}$  means the algorithm is able to recover the index of the ground truth w.p.  $1 - \delta$ . Thus one can think this learning process as a noisy channel which delivers  $\log_2 D(\mathcal{H}, \rho_{\mathcal{X}}, 2\varepsilon)$  bits of information. Since the data distribution is fixed, unlabeled data is independent of the ground

truth, and the only information source is the labels. With some information-theoretic inequalities, we can show the number of labels, or samples (i.e., bits of information)  $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{A}, P_{\mathcal{X}} \diamond \mathcal{H}, \varepsilon, \delta) \geq \log_2 D(\mathcal{H}, \rho_{\mathcal{X}}, 2\varepsilon) + \log_2(1 - \delta)$ . A more closer look yields Equation (2), because when  $\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{H}) < \infty$ , then only  $\log_2 \Pi_{\mathcal{H}}(n)$  instead of  $n$  bits information can be delivered.

# 5 LOWER BOUNDS

Below we first present a reduction from a special subclass of PAC learning to equivariant learning (Theorem 5.1), based on which we prove our main separation results, Theorem 4.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4.

Theorem 5.1. If  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{X}}$  is a set of data distributions that is invariant under group  $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{X}}$ , i.e.,  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{X}} \circ \mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{X}} = \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{X}}$ , then the following inequality holds. (Furthermore it becomes an equality when  $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{X}}$  is a compact group.)

$$
\inf  _ {\mathcal {A} \in \mathbb {A} _ {\mathcal {G} _ {\mathcal {X}}}} \mathcal {N} ^ {*} (\mathcal {A}, \mathcal {P} _ {\mathcal {X}} \diamond \mathcal {H}, \varepsilon) \geq \inf  _ {\mathcal {A} \in \mathbb {A}} \mathcal {N} ^ {*} (\mathcal {A}, \mathcal {P} _ {\mathcal {X}} \diamond (\mathcal {H} \circ \mathcal {G} _ {\mathcal {X}}), \varepsilon) \tag {3}
$$

Remark 5.1. The sample complexity in standard PAC learning is usually defined again hypothesis class  $\mathcal{H}$  only, i.e.,  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{X}}$  is the set of all the possible input distributions. In that case,  $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{X}}$  is always invariant under group  $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{X}}$ , and thus Theorem 5.1 says that  $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{X}}$ -equivariant learning against hypothesis class  $\mathcal{H}$  is as hard as learning against hypothesis  $\mathcal{H} \circ \mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{X}}$  without equivariance constraint.

# 5.1  $\Omega(d^2)$  LOWER BOUND FOR ORTHOGONAL EQUIVARIANCE WITH A FIXED DISTRIBUTION

In this subsection we show  $\Omega(d^2)$  vs  $O(1)$  separation on a single task in our main theorem (Theorem 5.2). With the same proof technique, we further show we can get correct dependency on  $\varepsilon$  for the lower bound, i.e.,  $\Omega\left(\frac{d^2}{\varepsilon}\right)$ , by considering a slightly larger function class, which can be learnt by ConvNets with  $O(d)$  samples. We also generalize this  $\Omega(d^2)$  vs  $O(d)$  separation to the case of  $\ell_2$  regression with a different proof technique.

Theorem 5.2. There's a single task,  $P_{X} \diamond h^{*}$ , where  $h^{*} = \mathrm{sign}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{d} x_{i}^{2} - \sum_{i=d+1}^{2d} x_{i}^{2}\right]$  and  $P_{X} = N(0, I_{2d})$  and a constant  $\varepsilon_{0} > 0$ , independent of  $d$ , such that for any orthogonal equivariant algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ , we have

$$
\mathcal {N} ^ {*} (\mathcal {A}, P _ {X} \diamond h ^ {*}, \varepsilon_ {0}) = \Omega (d ^ {2}), \tag {4}
$$

while there's a 2-layer ConvNet, such that  $\mathcal{N}(\mathsf{ERM}_{\mathsf{CNN}}, P_X \diamond h^*, \varepsilon, \delta) = O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\left(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon} + \log \frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$ . Moreover,  $\mathsf{ERM}_{\mathsf{CNN}}$  could be realized by gradient descent.

Proof of Theorem 5.2. Upper bound: implied by upper bound in Theorem 4.1. Lower bound: Note that the  $P_{\mathcal{X}} = N(0,I_{2d})$  is invariant under  $\mathcal{O}(2d)$ , by Theorem 5.1, it suffices to show that there's a constant  $\varepsilon_0 > 0$  (independent of  $d$ ), for any algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ , it takes  $\Omega(d^2)$  samples to learn the augmented function class  $h^* \circ \mathcal{O}(2d)$  w.r.t.  $P_X = N(0,I_{2d})$ . Define  $h_U = \text{sign}[\mathbf{x}_{1:d}^\top U\mathbf{x}_{d+1:2d}]$ ,  $\forall U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ , and by Lemma D.2, we have  $\mathcal{H} = \{h_U \mid U \in \mathcal{O}(d)\} \subseteq h^* \circ \mathcal{O}(2d)$ . Thus it suffices to a  $\Omega(d^2)$  sample complexity lower bound for the sub function class  $\mathcal{H}$ , i.e.,

$$
\mathcal {N} ^ {*} (\mathcal {A}, N (0, I _ {2 d}) \diamond \left\{\operatorname {s i g n} \left[ \mathbf {x} _ {1: d} ^ {\top} U \mathbf {x} _ {d + 1: 2 d} \right] \right\}, \varepsilon_ {0}) = \Omega \left(d ^ {2}\right). \tag {5}
$$

By Benedek&Itai's lower bound, (Benedek & Itai, 1991) (Equation (1)), we know

$$
\mathcal {N} (\mathcal {A}, \mathcal {P}, \varepsilon_ {0}, \delta) \geq \log_ {2} \left((1 - \delta) D \left(\mathcal {H}, \rho_ {\mathcal {X}}, 2 \varepsilon_ {0}\right)\right). \tag {6}
$$

By Lemma D.4, there's some constant  $C$ , such that  $D(\mathcal{H}, \rho_{\mathcal{X}}, \varepsilon) \geq \left(\frac{C}{\varepsilon}\right)^{\frac{d(d - 1)}{2}}$ ,  $\forall \varepsilon > 0$ .

The high-level idea for Lemma D.4 is to first show that  $\rho_{\mathcal{X}}(h_U, h_V) \geq \Omega \left( \frac{\|U - V \|_F}{\sqrt{d}} \right)$ , and then we show the packing number of orthogonal matrices in a small neighborhood of  $I_d$  w.r.t.  $\frac{\|\cdot\|_F}{\sqrt{d}}$  is roughly the same as that in the tangent space of orthogonal manifold at  $I_d$ , i.e., the set of skew matrices, which is of dimension  $\frac{d(d-1)}{2}$  and has packing number  $\left( \frac{C}{\varepsilon} \right)^{\frac{d(d-1)}{2}}$ . The advantage of working in the tangent space is that we can apply the standard volume argument.

Setting  $\delta = \frac{1}{2}$ , we have  $\mathcal{N}^*(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \varepsilon_0) \geq \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \frac{1}{2}, 2\varepsilon_0) \geq \frac{d(d - 1)}{2} \log_2 \frac{C}{4\varepsilon_0} - 1 = \Omega(d^2)$ .

Indeed, we can improve the above lower bound by applying Equation (2), and get

$$
\mathcal {N} (\mathcal {A}, \mathcal {P}, \varepsilon , \frac {1}{2}) \geq \frac {d ^ {2}}{e} \left(\frac {1}{2}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{d ^ {2}}} \left(\frac {C}{\varepsilon}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2} - \frac {1}{2 d}} = \Omega \left(d ^ {2} \varepsilon^ {- \frac {1}{2} + \frac {1}{2 d}}\right). \tag {7}
$$

Note that the dependency in  $\varepsilon$  in Equation (7) is  $\varepsilon^{-\frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{2d}}$  is not optimal, as opposed to  $\varepsilon^{-1}$  in upper bounds and other lower bounds. A possible reason for this might be that Theorem 4.2 (Long's improved version) is still not tight and it might require a tighter probabilistic upper bound for the growth number  $\Pi_{\mathcal{H}}(n)$ , at least taking  $P_{\mathcal{X}}$  into consideration, as opposed to the current upper bound using VC dimension only. We left it as an open problem to show a single task  $P$  with  $\Omega (\frac{d^2}{\varepsilon})$  sample complexity for all orthogonal equivariant algorithms.

However, if the hypothesis is of VC dimension  $O(d)$ , using a similar idea, we can prove a  $\Omega(d^2/\varepsilon)$  sample complexity lower bound for equivariant algorithms, and  $O(d)$  upper bounds for ConvNets.

Theorem 5.3 (Single distribution, multiple functions). There is a problem with single input distribution,  $\mathcal{P} = \{P_{\mathcal{X}}\} \diamond \mathcal{H} = \{N(0,I_d)\} \diamond \{\mathrm{sign}\left[\sum_{i = 1}^{d}\alpha_{i}x_{i}^{2}\right] \mid \alpha_{i} \in \mathbb{R}\}$ , such that for any orthogonal equivariant algorithms  $\mathcal{A}$  and  $\varepsilon > 0$ ,  $\mathcal{N}^*(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon) = \Omega(d^2/\varepsilon)$ , while there's a 2-layer ConvNets architecture, such that  $\mathcal{N}(\mathsf{ERM}_{\mathsf{CNN}},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon,\delta) = O\left(\frac{d\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon} + \log\frac{1}{\delta}}{\varepsilon}\right)$ .

Interestingly, we can show an analog of Theorem 5.3 for  $\ell_2$  regression, i.e., the algorithm not only observes the signs but also the values of labels  $y_{i}$ . Here we define the  $\ell_2$  loss of function  $h:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}$  as  $\ell_P(h) = \underset {(\mathbf{x},y)\sim P}{\mathbb{E}}\left[(h(\mathbf{x}) - y)^2\right]$  and the sample complexity  $\mathcal{N}^{*}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon)$  for  $\ell_2$  loss similarly as the smallest number  $n\in \mathbb{N}$  such that  $\forall P\in \mathcal{P}$ ,  $\underset {(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)\sim P}{\mathbb{E}}\left[\ell_P(\mathcal{A}(\{\mathbf{x}_i,y_i\}_{i = 1}^n))\right]\leq \varepsilon \underset {(x,y)\sim P}{\mathbb{E}}\left[y^2\right]$ . The last term  $\underset {(x,y)\sim P}{\mathbb{E}}\left[y^2\right]$  is added for normalization to avoid the scaling issue and thus any  $\varepsilon >1$  could be achieved trivially by predicting 0 for all data.

Theorem 5.4 (Single distribution, multiple functions,  $\ell_2$  regression). There is a problem with single input distribution,  $\mathcal{P} = \{P_{\mathcal{X}}\} \diamond \mathcal{H} = \{N(0,I_d)\} \diamond \{\sum_{i = 1}^{d}\alpha_i x_i^2\mid \alpha_i\in \mathbb{R}\}$ , such that for any orthogonal equivariant algorithms  $\mathcal{A}$  and  $\varepsilon >0,\mathcal{N}^{*}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon)\geq \frac{d(d + 3)}{2} (1 - \varepsilon) - 1$ , while there's a 2-layer ConvNet architecture, such that  $\mathcal{N}^{*}(\mathsf{ERM}_{\mathsf{CNN}},\mathcal{P},\varepsilon)\leq d$  for any  $\varepsilon >0$ .

# 5.2  $\Omega (d)$  LOWER BOUND FOR PERMUTATION EQUIVARIANCE

In this subsection we will present  $\Omega(d)$  lower bound for permutation equivariance via a different proof technique — direct coupling. The high-level idea of direct coupling is to show with constant probability over  $(\mathbf{X}_n, \mathbf{x})$ , we can find a  $g \in \mathcal{G}_{\chi}$ , such that  $g(\mathbf{X}_n) = \mathbf{X}_n$ , but  $\mathbf{x}$  and  $g(\mathbf{x})$  has different labels, in which case no equivariant algorithm could make the correct prediction.

Theorem 5.5. Let  $\mathbf{t}_i = \mathbf{e}_i + \mathbf{e}_{i+1}$  and  $\mathbf{s}_i = \mathbf{e}_i + \mathbf{e}_{i+2}^3$  and  $P$  be the uniform distribution on  $\{(\mathbf{s}_i, 1)\}_{i=1}^n \cup \{(\mathbf{t}_i, -1)\}_{i=1}^n$ , which is the classification problem for local textures in a 1-dimensional image with  $d$  pixels. Then for any permutation equivariant algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ ,  $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{8}) \geq \mathcal{N}^*(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \frac{1}{4}) \geq \frac{d}{10}$ . Meanwhile,  $\mathcal{N}(\mathsf{ERM}_{CNN}, \mathcal{P}, 0, \delta) \leq \log_2 \frac{1}{\delta} + 2$ , where  $\mathsf{ERM}_{CNN}$  stands for  $\mathsf{ERM}_{CNN}$  for function class of 2-layer ConvNets.

Remark 5.2. The task could be understood as detecting if there are two consecutive white pixels in the black background. For proof simplicity, we take texture of length 2 as an illustrative example. It is straightforward to extend the same proof to more sophisticated local pattern detection problem of any constant length and to 2-dimensional images.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We rigorously justify the common intuition that ConvNets can have better inductive bias than FC nets, by constructing a single natural distribution on which any FC net requires  $\Omega(d^2)$  samples to generalize if trained with most gradient-based methods starting with gaussian initialization. On the same task,  $O(1)$  samples suffice for convolutional architectures. We further extend our results to permutation equivariant algorithms, including adaptive training algorithms like Adam and AdaGrad,  $\ell_1$  regularization, etc. The separation becomes  $\Omega(d)$  vs  $O(1)$  in this case.
