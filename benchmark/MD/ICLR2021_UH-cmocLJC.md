# ABSTRACT

We study how neural networks trained by gradient descent extrapolate, i.e., what they learn outside the support of the training distribution. Previous works report mixed empirical results when extrapolating with neural networks: while multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) do not extrapolate well in certain simple tasks, Graph Neural Network (GNN), a structured network with MLP modules, has shown some success in more complex tasks. Working towards a theoretical explanation, we identify conditions under which MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well. First, we quantify the observation that ReLU MLPs quickly converge to linear functions along any direction from the origin, which implies that ReLU MLPs do not extrapolate most non-linear functions. But, they can provably learn a linear target function when the training distribution is sufficiently "diverse". Second, in connection to analyzing successes and limitations of GNNs, these results suggest a hypothesis for which we provide theoretical and empirical evidence: the success of GNNs in extrapolating algorithmic tasks to new data (e.g., larger graphs or edge weights) relies on encoding task-specific non-linearities in the architecture or features.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Humans extrapolate well in many tasks. For example, we can apply arithmetics to arbitrarily large numbers. One may wonder whether a neural network can do the same and generalize to examples arbitrarily far from the training data (Santoro et al., 2018). Curiously, previous works report mixed extrapolation results with neural networks. Early works demonstrate feedforward neural networks, a.k.a. multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), fail to extrapolate well when learning simple polynomial functions (Barnard & Wessels, 1992; Haley & Soloway, 1992). However, recent works show Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Scarselli et al., 2009), a class of structured networks with MLP building blocks, can generalize to graphs much larger than training graphs in challenging algorithmic tasks, such as predicting the time evolution of physical systems (Battaglia et al., 2016), learning graph algorithms (Velickovic et al., 2020), and solving mathematical equations (Lample & Charton, 2020).

To explain this puzzle, we formally study how neural networks trained by gradient descent (GD) extrapolate, i.e., what they learn outside the support of training distribution. We say a neural network extrapolates well if it learns a task outside the training distribution. At first glance, it may seem that neural networks can behave arbitrarily outside the training distribution since they have high capacity (Zhang et al., 2017) and are universal approximators (Cybenko, 1989; Funahashi, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Kurkova, 1992). However, neural networks are constrained by gradient descent training (Hardt et al., 2016; Soudry et al., 2018). In our analysis, we explicitly consider such implicit bias through the analogy of the training dynamics of over-parameterized neural networks and kernel regression via the neural tangent kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al., 2018).

We begin with MLPs, the simplest neural networks and building blocks of more complex architectures such as GNNs. First, we show that the predictions of over-parameterized MLPs with ReLU activation trained by GD converge to linear functions along any direction from the origin. We prove a convergence rate (Theorem 3) and empirically observe that convergence often occurs close to (but outside) the training data (Fig. 1), which suggests ReLU MLPs cannot extrapolate well for most non-linear tasks. We emphasize that our results do not follow from the fact that ReLU MLPs have finitely many linear regions (Arora et al., 2018; Hanin & Rolnick, 2019b; Hein et al., 2019). While having finitely many linear regions implies ReLU MLPs eventually become linear, it does not say

Figure 1: How ReLU MLPs extrapolate. We train MLPs to learn non-linear functions (grey) and plot their predictions both within (blue) and outisde (black) the training distribution. MLPs converge quickly to linear functions outside the training data range along directions from the origin (Theorem 3). Hence, MLPs do not extrapolate well in most non-linear tasks. But, with appropriate training data, MLPs can extrapolate globally linear target functions well (Theorem 5).

Figure 2: How GNNs extrapolate. Since MLPs can extrapolate well when learning linear functions, we hypothesize that GNNs can extrapolate well in dynamic programming (DP) tasks if we encode appropriate non-linearity in the architecture (left) and/or input representation (right; through domain knowledge or representation learning). The encoded non-linearities may not be necessary for interpolation, as they can be approximated by MLP modules, but they help extrapolation. We support the hypothesis theoretically (Theorem 9) and empirically (Fig. 5).

whether MLPs will learn the correct target function close to the training distribution. In contrast, our results are non-asymptotic and quantify what kind of functions MLPs will learn close to the training distribution. Second, we identify a condition when MLPs extrapolate well: the task is linear and the geometry of the training distribution satisfies a condition (Theorem 5). To our knowledge, our results are the first extrapolation results of this kind for feedforward neural networks.

Next, we relate our insights into MLPs to GNNs, to explain why GNNs extrapolate well in some algorithmic tasks. Prior works report successful extrapolation for tasks that can be solved by dynamic programming (DP) (Bellman, 1966), which has a similar computation structure as GNNs (Xu et al., 2020). The DP updates can be decomposed into non-linear and linear steps. Hence, we hypothesize that GNNs trained by GD can extrapolate well in a DP task, if we encode appropriate non-linearity in the architecture and input representation (Fig. 2). Importantly, encoding non-linearity may be unnecessary for GNNs to interpolate, because the MLP modules can easily learn many non-linear functions inside the training distribution (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Xu et al., 2020), but encoding non-linearity is crucial for GNNs to extrapolate correctly. We prove this hypothesis for a simplified case using Graph NTK (Du et al., 2019b). Empirically, we validate the hypothesis on three DP tasks: max degree, shortest paths, and  $n$ -body problem. We show GNNs with appropriate architecture, input representation, and training distribution can predict well on graphs with unseen sizes, structures, edge weights, and node features. Our theory explains the empirical success in previous works and suggests their limitations: successful extrapolation relies on encoding task-specific non-linearity, which requires domain knowledge or extensive model search.

In summary, we study how MLPs and GNNs extrapolate. First, ReLU MLPs trained by GD converge to linear functions along directions from the origin with a rate of  $O(1 / \epsilon)$ . Second, to explain why GNNs extrapolate well in some algorithmic tasks, we prove that ReLU MLPs can extrapolate well in linear tasks, leading to a hypothesis: GNNs can extrapolate well when appropriate non-linearity is encoded into the architecture and features. We prove this hypothesis for a simplified case and provide empirical support for more general settings. All our claims are supported with experiments (details in Appendix C).

# 1.1 RELATED WORK

Early works show example tasks where MLPs do not extrapolate well, e.g. learning simple polynomials (Barnard & Wessels, 1992; Haley & Soloway, 1992). We instead show a general pattern of how ReLU MLPs extrapolate and identify conditions for MLPs to extrapolate well. More recent works study the implicit biases induced on MLPs by gradient descent, for both the "NTK" and "adaptive" regimes (Bietti & Mairal, 2019; Chizat & Bach, 2018; Li et al., 2019; Song et al., 2018). Related to our results, some works show MLP predictions converge to "simple" piecewise linear functions, e.g., with few linear regions (Hanin & Rolnick, 2019a; Maennel et al., 2018; Savarese et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2019). Our work differs in that none of these works explicitly studies extrapolation, and some focus only on one-dimensional inputs. Recent works also show that in high-dimensional settings of the NTK regime, MLP is asymptotically at most a linear predictor in certain scaling limits (Ba et al., 2020; Ghorbani et al., 2019). We study a different setting (extrapolation), and our analysis is non-asymptotic in nature and does not rely on random matrix theory.

Prior works explore GNN extrapolation by testing on larger graphs (Battaglia et al., 2018; Santoro et al., 2018; Saxton et al., 2019; Velickovic et al., 2020). We are the first to theoretically study GNN extrapolation, and we complete the notion of extrapolation to include unseen features and structures.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

We begin by introducing our setting. Let  $\mathcal{X}$  be the domain of interest, here, vectors or graphs. The task is to learn an underlying function  $g: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$  with a training set  $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n \subset \mathcal{D}$ , where  $y_i = g(x_i)$  and  $\mathcal{D}$  is the support of training distribution.

Previous works have extensively studied in-distribution generalization where the training and the test distributions are identical (Valiant, 1984; Vapnik, 2013); i.e.,  $\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{X}$ . In contrast, extrapolation addresses predictions on a domain  $\mathcal{X}$  that is larger than the support of the training distribution  $\mathcal{D}$ . We will say that a model extrapolates well if it has small extrapolation error, the maximum test error outside the training support  $\mathcal{D}$ .

Definition 1. (Extrapolation error). Suppose  $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$  is a model trained on  $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n \subset \mathcal{D}$ . We define the extrapolation error of  $f$  on  $\mathcal{X}$  as  $\|f - g\|_{\infty, \mathcal{X} \setminus \mathcal{D}} = \sup \{|f(\boldsymbol{x}) - g(\boldsymbol{x})| : \boldsymbol{x} \in \mathcal{X} \setminus \mathcal{D}\}$ .

We focus on neural networks trained by gradient descent (GD) or its variants with mean squared loss. We study two neural network architectures: MLPs and GNNs.

Graph Neural Networks. GNNs are structured networks operating on graphs with MLP modules (Battaglia et al., 2018). The input is a graph  $G = (V,E)$ . Each node  $u \in V$  has a feature vector  $\pmb{x}_u$ , and each edge  $(u,v) \in E$  has a feature vector  $\pmb{w}_{(u,v)}$ . GNNs iteratively compute a representation for each node. Initially, the node representations are the node features:  $\pmb{h}_u^{(0)} = \pmb{x}_u$ . In iteration  $k = 1..K$ , a GNN updates the node representations  $\pmb{h}_u^{(k)}$  by aggregating the neighboring nodes' representations with MLP modules (Gilmer et al., 2017). We can optionally compute a graph representation  $\pmb{h}_G$  by aggregating the final node representations with another MLP. Formally,

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {u} ^ {(k)} = \sum_ {v \in \mathcal {N} (u)} \operatorname {M L P} ^ {(k)} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {u} ^ {(k - 1)}, \boldsymbol {h} _ {v} ^ {(k - 1)}, \boldsymbol {w} _ {(v, u)}\right), \quad \boldsymbol {h} _ {G} = \operatorname {M L P} ^ {(K + 1)} \left(\sum_ {u \in G} \boldsymbol {h} _ {u} ^ {(K)}\right). \tag {1}
$$

The final output is the graph representation  $h_G$  or final node representations  $h_u^{(K)}$  depending on the task. We refer to the neighbor aggregation step for  $h_u^{(k)}$  as aggregation and the pooling step in  $h_G$  as readout. Previous works typically use sum-aggregation and sum-readout (Battaglia et al., 2018). Our results indicate why replacing them may help extrapolation (Section 4).

Related settings. Previous works have studied related settings. Domain adaptation focuses on generalizing beyond the training distribution to a specific target domain, and typical strategies adjust the training to specifically incorporate unlabeled samples from the target domain (Ben-David et al., 2010; Mansour et al., 2009; Blitzer et al., 2008; Ganin et al., 2016). Distributional robustness (Goh & Sim, 2010; Sagawa et al., 2020; Sinha et al., 2018) and adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2014) consider small adversarial perturbations within local neighborhoods, which are special cases of extrapolation. Invariant models, based on a causality perspective (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Rojas-Carulla et al., 2018) assume specific invariances across relevant distributions.

We train MLPs to learn 2D linear functions (grey) with different training distributions (blue) and plot out-of-distribution predictions (black). Following Theorem 5, MLPs extrapolate well when the training distribution (blue) has support in all directions (first panel), but not otherwise: in the two middle panels, some dimensions of the training data are constrained to be positive (red arrows); in the last panel, one dimension of the training data is a fixed constant.

For linear target functions, MLPs extrapolate well if the training distribution covers all directions (Fig. 4b and 3).

# 3 HOW RELU MULTILAYER PERCEPTRONS EXTRAPOLATE

MLPs are the simplest neural networks and building blocks of more complex networks such as GNNs, so we first study how MLPs trained by GD extrapolate. In this paper, we assume that MLPs have ReLU activation functions. Appendix D.3 contains preliminary results for other activations.

# 3.1 LINEAR EXTRAPOLATION BEHAVIOR OF RELU MLPS

By architecture, ReLU networks learn piecewise linear functions, but what do these regions look like outside the support of the training data? Fig. 1 illustrates examples of how ReLU networks extrapolate when trained on various nonlinear functions. These examples suggest that outside the training support, the predictions quickly become linear along directions from the origin. We empirically verify this pattern via linear regression on MLPs' predictions (Appendix C.2). Outside the training data range, along any directions from the origin, the coefficient of determination  $(R^2)$  is always greater than 0.99; i.e., MLPs "linearize" almost immediately outside the training data range.

We formalize this observation using the implicit biases of neural networks trained by GD via the neural tangent kernel (NTK): optimization trajectories of overparameterized networks trained by GD are equivalent to those of kernel regression with a specific neural tangent kernel, under a set of assumptions called the "NTK regime" (Jacot et al., 2018). We provide an informal definition here; for further details, we refer the readers to Jacot et al. (2018) and Appendix A.

Definition 2. (Informal) A neural network trained in the NTK regime is infinitely wide, randomly initialized with certain scaling, and trained by GD with infinitesimally small steps and squared loss.

Previous works analyze optimization and in-distribution generalization of overparameterized neural networks with NTK (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019a;b; Arora et al., 2019a;b; Cao & Gu, 2019; Du et al., 2019c;a; Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2018). We instead analyze extrapolation.

Theorem 3 formalizes our observation from Fig. 1: outside the training data range, along any direction  $t\mathbf{v}$  from the origin, the prediction of a two-layer ReLU MLP quickly converges to a linear function with rate  $O\left(\frac{1}{t}\right)$ . The linear coefficients  $\beta_{\mathbf{v}}$  and the constant terms in the convergence rate depend on the training data and direction  $\mathbf{v}$ . The proof is in Appendix B.1.

Theorem 3. Suppose we train a two-layer ReLU MLP  $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$  in the NTK regime. For any direction  $\pmb{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , let  $\pmb{x}_0 = t\pmb{v}$ . As  $t \to \infty$ ,  $f(\pmb{x}_0 + h\pmb{v}) - f(\pmb{x}_0) \to \beta_{\pmb{v}} \cdot h$  for any  $h > 0$ , where  $\beta_{\pmb{v}}$  is a constant linear coefficient. Moreover, given  $\epsilon > 0$ , for  $t = O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ , we have  $\left|\frac{f(\pmb{x}_0 + h\pmb{v}) - f(\pmb{x}_0)}{h} - \beta_{\pmb{v}}\right| < \epsilon$ .

Previous works show that ReLU MLPs have finitely many linear regions (Arora et al., 2018; Hanin & Rolnick, 2019b), which implies that their predictions eventually become linear. In contrast, Theorem 3 is a more fine-grained analysis of how MLPs extrapolate and provides a convergence rate.

Theorem 3 also suggests which target functions a ReLU MLP may be able to match outside the training data: only functions that are almost-linear along the directions away from the origin. Indeed, the results in Fig. 4a (details in Appendix C.1) show that, outside the training data, the predictions do not match target functions such as  $\boldsymbol{x}^{\top} A \boldsymbol{x}$  (quadratic),  $\sum_{i=1}^{d} \cos(2\pi \cdot \boldsymbol{x}^{(i)})$  (cos), and  $\sum_{i=1}^{d} \sqrt{\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)}}$  (sqrt), where  $\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)}$  is the  $i$ -th dimension of input vector  $\boldsymbol{x}$ . In contrast, with suitable hyperparameters, MLPs extrapolate the L1 norm correctly (Fig. 4a), which satisfies the directional linearity condition.

Fig. 4a provides one more positive result: MLPs extrapolate linear target functions well, across many different hyperparameters. While learning linear functions may seem very limited at first, in Section 4 this insight will help explain extrapolation properties of GNNs in non-linear practical tasks. Before that, we first theoretically analyze when MLPs extrapolate well.

# 3.2 WHEN RELU MLPS PROVABLY EXTRAPOLATE WELL

Fig. 4a shows that MLPs can extrapolate well when the target function is linear. However, this is not always true. In this section, we show that successful extrapolation depends on the geometry of training data. Intuitively, the training distribution must be "diverse" enough for correct extrapolation.

We provide two conditions that relate the geometry of the training data to extrapolation. Lemma 4 states that overparameterized MLPs can learn a linear target function with only  $2d$  examples.

Lemma 4. Suppose the target function is  $g(\pmb{x}) = \beta^{\top}\pmb{x}$  for some  $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ . Suppose the training set  $\{\pmb{x}_i\}_{i=1}^n$  contains an orthogonal basis  $\{\hat{\pmb{x}}_i\}_{i=1}^d$  and its opposite vectors  $\{-\hat{\pmb{x}}_i\}_{i=1}^d$ . If we train a two-layer ReLU MLP  $f$  on  $\{(\pmb{x}_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$  in the NTK regime, then  $f(\pmb{x}) = \beta^{\top}\pmb{x}$  for all  $\pmb{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ .

Lemma 4 is mainly of theoretical interest, as the  $2d$  examples need to be carefully chosen. Theorem 5 builds on Lemma 4 and identifies a more practical condition for successful extrapolation: if the support of the training distribution covers all directions (e.g., a hypercube that covers the origin), MLPs in the NTK regime converge to a linear target function with sufficient training data.

Theorem 5. Suppose the target function is  $g(\pmb{x}) = \beta^{\top}\pmb{x}$  for some  $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ . Suppose the training data  $\{\pmb{x}_i\}_{i=1}^n$  is sampled from a distribution whose support  $\mathcal{D}$  contains a connected subset  $S$ , where for any non-zero  $\pmb{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ , there exists  $k > 0$  so that  $k\pmb{w} \in S$ . If we train a two-layer ReLU MLP  $f: \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R}$  on  $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$  in the NTK regime, then  $f(\pmb{x}) \xrightarrow{p} \beta^{\top}\pmb{x}$  as  $n \to \infty$ .

Experiments: geometry of training data affects extrapolation. The condition in Theorem 5 formalizes the intuition that the training distribution must be "diverse" for successful extrapolation, i.e.,  $\mathcal{D}$  must include all directions. Empirically, the extrapolation error is indeed small when the condition of Theorem 5 is satisfied ("all" in Fig. 4b). In contrast, the extrapolation error is much larger when the training examples are restricted to only some directions (Fig. 4b and Fig. 3).

Theorem 5 also suggests why spurious correlations hurt extrapolation, complementing the causality arguments from previous works (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2016; Rojas-Carulla et al., 2018). When the training data has spurious correlations, some combinations of features are missing; e.g., camels might only appear in deserts in an image collection. Therefore, the condition for Theorem 5 no longer holds, and the model may extrapolate incorrectly.

Theorem 5 is analogous to an identifiability condition for linear models, but stricter. We can uniquely identify a linear function if the training data has full (feature) rank. MLPs are more expressive, so identifying the linear target function requires additional constraints.

In summary, we analyze how MLPs extrapolate and provide two insights: (1) MLPs cannot extrapolate most non-linear tasks, because they quickly converge to directionally linear functions (Theorem 3); and (2) MLPs can extrapolate well when the target function is linear, provided the training distribution is "diverse" (Theorem 5). In the next section, these results will help us understand how more complex networks extrapolate, specifically, GNNs for non-linear algorithmic tasks.

# 4 HOW GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS EXTRAPOLATE

Above, we saw that extrapolation in non-linear tasks is hard for MLPs (Theorem 3). Despite this limitation, GNNs have been shown to extrapolate well in some non-linear algorithmic tasks, such as intuitive physics (Battaglia et al., 2016; Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2018), graph algorithms (Battaglia et al., 2018; Velickovic et al., 2020), and symbolic mathematics (Lample & Charton, 2020). To address this discrepancy, we build on our MLP results and study how GNNs trained by GD extrapolate.

# 4.1 HYPOTHESIS: LINEAR ALGORITHMIC ALIGNMENT HELPS EXTRAPOLATION

We begin with an example: training GNNs to solve the shortest path problem. For this task, prior works observe that a modified GNN architecture with min-aggregation can generalize to graphs larger than those in the training set (Battaglia et al., 2018; Velickovic et al., 2020):

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {u} ^ {(k)} = \min  _ {v \in \mathcal {N} (u)} \operatorname {M L P} ^ {(k)} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {u} ^ {(k - 1)}, \boldsymbol {h} _ {v} ^ {(k - 1)}, \boldsymbol {w} _ {(v, u)}\right). \tag {2}
$$

We first provide an intuitive explanation (Fig 2a). Shortest path can be solved by the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm (Bellman, 1958) with the following update:

$$
d [ k ] [ u ] = \min  _ {v \in \mathcal {N} (u)} d [ k - 1 ] [ v ] + \boldsymbol {w} (v, u), \tag {3}
$$

where  $\pmb{w}(v,u)$  is the weight of edge  $(v,u)$ , and  $d[k][u]$  is the shortest distance to node  $u$  within  $k$  steps. The two equations are similar: GNNs can simulate the BF algorithm if the MLP modules learn a linear function  $d[k - 1][v] + \pmb{w}(v,u)$ . Since MLPs can extrapolate well in linear tasks (Theorem 5), this "alignment" might explain why min-aggregation GNNs can extrapolate well in this task.

For comparison, we can reason why we would not expect GNNs with the more commonly used sum-aggregation (Eqn. 1) to extrapolate well in this task. With sum-aggregation, the MLP modules need to learn a non-linear function to simulate the BF algorithm, but Theorem 3 suggests that they will not extrapolate for most nonlinearities outside the training support.

We can extend the above intuition to other algorithmic tasks. Many target tasks where GNNs extrapolate well can be solved by dynamic programming (DP) (Bellman, 1966), an algorithmic paradigm with a recursive structure similar to GNNs' (Eqn. 1) (Xu et al., 2020).

Definition 6. Dynamic programming (DP) is a recursive procedure with updates

$$
\operatorname {A n s w e r} [ k ] [ s ] = \mathrm {D P - U p d a t e} (\{\operatorname {A n s w e r} [ k - 1 ] [ s ^ {\prime} ] \}, s ^ {\prime} = 1 \dots n), \tag {4}
$$

where  $\text{Answer}[k][s]$  is the solution to a sub-problem indexed by iteration  $k$  and state  $s$ , and DP-Update is a task-specific update function that solves the sub-problem based on the previous iteration.

Building on the extrapolation behavior of MLPs, we hypothesize that: given a DP task, if we can encode appropriate non-linearity in the model architecture and input representations so that the MLP modules only need to learn a linear step, then GNNs can extrapolate well.

Hypothesis 7. (Linear algorithmic alignment). Let  $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$  be an algorithm and  $\mathcal{N}$  a neural network with  $m$  MLP modules. Suppose there exist  $m$  linear functions  $\{g_i\}_{i=1}^m$  so that by replacing  $\mathcal{N}'s$  MLP modules with  $g_i's$ ,  $\mathcal{N}$  simulates  $f$ . Given  $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists  $\{(x_i, f(x_i))\}_{i=1}^n \subset \mathcal{D} \subsetneq \mathcal{X}$  so that  $\mathcal{N}$  trained on  $\{(x_i, f(x_i))\}_{i=1}^n$  by GD with squared loss learns  $\hat{f}$  with  $\| \hat{f} - f \| < \epsilon$ .

Our hypothesis builds on the algorithmic alignment framework of (Xu et al., 2020), which suggests that GNNs can interpolate well if MLP modules are "aligned" to easy-to-learn (possibly non-linear) functions. Successful extrapolation is harder: MLP modules need to align with linear functions.

To satisfy the linear algorithmic alignment assumption, we can encode appropriate non-linear operations in either the architecture or input representation (Fig. 2). The shortest path example shows

In max degree, GNNs with max readout extrapolate well if the max/min degrees of the training graphs are not restricted (Theorem 9).

one example of encoding nonlinearity in the architecture. Another example are neural symbolic programs, which encode a library of operations (Johnson et al., 2017; Yi et al., 2018). For some tasks, it may be easier to change the input representation (Fig. 2b). Sometimes, we can decompose the target function  $f$  as  $f = g \circ h$  into an embedding  $h$  and a "simpler" target function  $g$  that our model can extrapolate well. If we can identify  $h$  from domain knowledge, then the model only needs to learn  $g$  (Lample & Charton, 2020). Alternatively,  $h$  may be obtained via representation learning with unlabeled out-of-distribution data from  $\mathcal{X} \setminus \mathcal{D}$  (Chen et al., 2020; Devlin et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020; Peters et al., 2018), which might explain why pre-trained representations such as BERT can improve out-of-distribution robustness (Hendrycks et al., 2020).

Previous works that show successful extrapolation indeed use specialized architectures (Velickovic et al., 2020) or input representations (Lample & Charton, 2020), and other works find the commonly-used sum-based GNNs do not extrapolate well (Santoro et al., 2018; Saxton et al., 2019). Our linear algorithmic alignment hypothesis explains these results and suggests that extrapolation is hard in general: encoding appropriate non-linearity often requires domain expertise and/or extensive model tuning. Next, we provide theoretical and empirical support for the linear algorithmic alignment hypothesis. While we focus on GNNs, our theoretical results may be applied to other networks too.

# 4.2 THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL SUPPORT

We validate our hypothesis on three DP tasks: max degree, shortest path and  $n$ -body problem (Fig. 5). We prove the hypothesis for max degree, and highlight the role of graph structures in extrapolation.

Theoretical analysis. We start with a simple yet fundamental task: learning the max degree of a graph, a special case of DP with one iteration. As a corollary of Theorem 3, the commonly used sum-based GNN (Eqn. 1) cannot extrapolate well (proof in Appendix B.4).

Corollary 8. GNNs with sum-aggregation and sum-readout do not extrapolate well in Max Degree.

To achieve linear algorithmic alignment, we can encode the only non-linearity, the max function, in the readout. Theorem 9 confirms that a GNN with max-readout can extrapolate well in this task.

Theorem 9. Assume all nodes have the same feature. Let  $g$  and  $g'$  be the max/min degree function, respectively. Let  $\{(G_i, g(G_i))\}_{i=1}^n$  be the training set. If  $\{(g(G_i), g'(G_i), g(G_i) \cdot N_i^{\max}, g'(G_i) \cdot N_i^{\min})\}_{i=1}^n$  spans  $\mathbb{R}^4$ , where  $N_i^{\max}$  and  $N_i^{\min}$  are the number of nodes that have max/min degree on  $G_i$ , then a one-layer max-readout GNN trained on  $\{(G_i, g(G_i))\}_{i=1}^n$  in the NTK regime learns  $g$ .

Theorem 9 does not follow immediately from Theorem 5, because MLP modules in GNNs only receive indirect supervision. We analyze the Graph NTK (Du et al., 2019b) to prove Theorem 9 in Appendix B.5. While Theorem 9 assumes identical node features, we empirically observe similar results for both identical and non-identical features (Fig. 15 in Appendix).

Interpretation of conditions. The condition in Theorem 9 is analogous to that in Theorem 5. Both theorems require diverse training data, measured by graph structure in Theorem 9 or directions in Theorem 5. In Theorem 9, the condition is violated if all training graphs have the same max or min node degrees, e.g., when training data are from one of the following families: path, regular graphs with degree  $C$  ( $C$ -regular), cycle, and ladder.

Experiments: architectures that help extrapolation. We validate our theoretical analysis with two DP tasks: max degree and shortest path (details in Appendix C.5 and C.6). While previous works only test on graphs with different sizes (Battaglia et al., 2018; Velickovic et al., 2020), we also test on graphs with unseen structure, edge weights and node features. The results support our theory. For max degree, GNNs with max-readout are better than GNNs with sum-readout (Fig. 6a), confirming Corollary 8 and Theorem 9. For shortest path, GNNs with min-readout and min-aggregation are better than GNNs with sum-readout (Fig. 5a).

Experiments confirm the importance of training graphs structure (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the two tasks favor different graph structures. For max degree, as Theorem 9 predicts, GNNs extrapolate well when trained on trees, complete graphs, expanders, and general graphs, and extrapolation errors are higher when trained on 4-regular, cycles, or ladder graphs. For shortest path, extrapolation errors follow a U-shaped curve as we change the sparsity of training graphs (Fig. 6b and Fig. 17 in Appendix). Intuitively, models trained on sparse or dense graphs are more likely to learn degenerative solutions.

Experiments: representations that help extrapolation. Finally, we show a good input representation also helps extrapolation. We study the  $n$ -body problem (Battaglia et al., 2016; Watters et al., 2017) (Appendix C.7), predicting the time evolution of  $n$  objects in a gravitational system. Following previous work, the input is a complete graph where the nodes are the objects (Battaglia et al., 2016). The node feature for  $u$  is the concatenation of the object's mass  $m_u$ , position  $\pmb{x}_u^{(t)}$ , and velocity  $\pmb{v}_u^{(t)}$  at time  $t$ . The edge features are set to zero. We train GNNs to predict the velocity of each object  $u$  at time  $t + 1$ . The true velocity  $f(G; u)$  for object  $u$  is approximately

$$
f (G; u) \approx \boldsymbol {v} _ {u} ^ {t} + \boldsymbol {a} _ {u} ^ {t} \cdot d t, \quad \boldsymbol {a} _ {u} ^ {t} = C \cdot \sum_ {v \neq u} \frac {m _ {v}}{\| \boldsymbol {x} _ {u} ^ {t} - \boldsymbol {x} _ {v} ^ {t} \| _ {2} ^ {3}} \cdot \left(\boldsymbol {x} _ {v} ^ {t} - \boldsymbol {x} _ {u} ^ {t}\right), \tag {5}
$$

where  $C$  is a constant. To learn  $f$ , the MLP modules need to learn a non-linear function. Therefore, we do not expect GNNs to extrapolate well to unseen masses or distances, and indeed they do not ("original features" in Fig. 5b). To extrapolate well in this task, we use an improved representation  $h(G)$  to encode non-linearity. At time  $t$ , for any edge  $(u,v)$ , we transform the edge features from zero to  $\boldsymbol{w}_{(u,v)}^{(t)} = m_v \cdot (\boldsymbol{x}_v^{(t)} - \boldsymbol{x}_u^{(t)}) / \| \boldsymbol{x}_u^{(t)} - \boldsymbol{x}_v^{(t)} \|_2^3$ . The new edge features do not add information, but the MLP modules only need to learn linear functions now, which helps extrapolation ("improved features" in Fig. 5b).

# 5 CONCLUSION

This paper is an initial step towards formally understanding how neural networks trained by gradient descent extrapolate. We identify conditions where MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well. We explain how GNNs could extrapolate well in complex algorithmic tasks, given the hardness of extrapolation: encoding appropriate non-linearity in architecture and input representation can help extrapolation. Our results and hypothesis agree with empirical results, in this paper and in the literature.
