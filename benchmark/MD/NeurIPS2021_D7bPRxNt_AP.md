# Abstract

We present a novel neural surface reconstruction method, called NeuS, for reconstructing objects with high fidelity from 2D image inputs. Existing neural reconstruction approaches, such as DVR [21] and IDR [31], suffer from being easily trapped in a local minima, struggle with the objects with severe self-occlusions, abrupt depth changes and thin structures, and require foreground masks as supervision, due to the local optimization process in surface rendering used. On the other hand, volume rendering based methods have shown the robustness to these challenging cases; however, extracting high-quality surfaces from such a learned implicit representation is difficult because there are no sufficient constraints on the surface geometry to enforce a continuous zero level set. To address these issues, we represent 3D geometry as Signed Distance Function (SDF) and develop a new volume rendering method to train the neural SDF representation to ensure that the contribution to the ray color in color accumulation process is mostly from the first intersection of the camera ray with the surface. Experiments on the DTU dataset and the BlendedMVS dataset show that NeuS outperforms the state-of-the-arts in high-quality surface reconstruction, especially for the objects with complex structures and self-occlusion.

# 1 Introduction

Reconstructing surface geometry from multi-view images is a fundamental problem in computer vision and computer graphics. 3D reconstruction with neural implicit representations has recently become a highly promising alternative to classical reconstruction approaches [27, 6, 2] due to its high reconstruction quality and the potential to handle challenging cases that are difficult for classical approaches, such as non-lambertian surfaces and thin structures. Recent works model 3D geometry as SDF [31, 34, 14] or occupancy [21, 22]. To train their neural models, these methods use a differentiable surface rendering method to render a 3D object into images and use the render images to compare against input images for supervision. For example, IDR [31] produces impressive reconstruction results but it fails to reconstruct objects with complex structures that cause abrupt depth changes. The cause of this limitation is that the surface rendering method used in IDR only considers a single surface intersection point for each ray. Consequently, the gradient only exists at this single point, which is too local for effective back propagation and would get optimization stuck in local optima when there are abrupt changes of depth on images. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (a) top, with the radical depth change caused by the hole, the network would incorrectly predict the points near the front surface to be blue, failing to find the far-back blue surface. The actual test example in Fig. 1 (b) shows that IDR fails to correctly reconstruct the surfaces near the edges with abrupt depth changes.

Recently, NeRF [20] and its variants have explored to use a volume rendering method to learn a volume density field for novel view synthesis. This volume rendering approach samples multiple points along each ray and accumulates the alpha values and colors of the sampled points to produce the output pixel colors for training purposes. The advantage of the volume rendering approach is that it can handle abrupt depth changes, because it considers multiple points along the ray and so all the sample points, either on the near surface or on the far-surface, produce gradient signals for back propagation. For example, referring Fig. 1 (a) bottom, when the near surface (yellow) is found to have inconsistent colors with the input image, the volume rendering approach is capable to train the network to find the far-back surface to produce the correct scene representation. However, the volume rendering approach in NeRF is only designed for a volume density field (i.e. radiance field) which is not a proper surface representation. In fact, it is difficult to extract a high-quality surface from such the density field. For example, Fig. 1 (b) shows a surface extracted as a level-set surface of the density field computed by NeRF. Although the surface correctly accounts for abrupt depth changes, it contains conspicuous noise in the planar regions.

Ours

We present a new neural rendering scheme, called NeuS, for multi-view surface reconstruction that integrates the Signed Distance Function (SDF) for surface representation and the volume rendering approach to improve robustness of training a neural SDF representation for complex objects. By introducing a density distribution induced by SDF, our method enables volume rendering on an implicit SDF representation and thus has the best of both worlds, i.e. accurate surface representation by using an implicit SDF model and robust network training in the presence of abrupt depth changes as enabled by volume rendering. Note that simply applying the standard the volume rendering method to the density associated with SDF would lead to bias (i.e. systematic geometric errors) in the reconstructed surfaces, which is a subtle but important observation that we will elaborate later. Hence, we will present a novel volume rendering algorithm to ensure unbiased surface reconstruction. Experiments on both DTU dataset and BlendedMVS dataset demonstrated that NeuS is capable of reconstructing complex 3D objects with severe occlusions and delicate structures. It outperforms the state-of-the-art neural reconstruction methods, namely IDR [31] and UniSurf [22], in terms of reconstruction quality.

Classical Multi-view Surface and Volumetric Reconstruction. Traditional multi-view 3D reconstruction methods can be roughly classified into two categories: point- and surface-based reconstruction [2, 6, 8, 27] and volumetric reconstruction [5, 3, 28]. Point- and surface-based reconstruction methods estimate the depth map of each pixel by exploiting inter-image photometric consistency [7] and then fuse the depth maps into a global dense point cloud [17, 33]. The surface reconstruction is usually done as a post processing with methods like screened Poisson surface Reconstruction [13]. The reconstruction quality heavily relies on the quality of correspondence matching, and the difficulties in matching correspondence for objects without rich textures often lead to severe artifacts and missing parts in the reconstruction results. On the other hand, volumetric reconstruction methods side-step the problem of explicit correspondence matching by estimating occupancy and color in a voxel grid from multi-view images and evaluating the color consistency of each voxel. Due to limited achievable voxel resolution, these methods cannot achieve high accuracy.

Neural Implicit Representation. Neural implicit representation has recently become a popular alternative to classical scene representations, e.g. point cloud, voxel grids, meshes, due to its high achievable spatial resolution. This representation has been applied and made great progress in shape representation [18, 19, 23, 4, 1, 9, 32, 24], novel view synthesis [29, 16, 12, 20, 15, 25, 26] and multi-view 3D reconstruction [31, 21, 14, 11].

Our work mainly focuses on learning implicit neural representation encoding both geometry and appearance from 2D images via classical rendering techniques. Limited in this scope, the related works can be roughly categorized based on the rendering techniques used, i.e. surface rendering based methods and volume rendering based methods. Surface rendering based methods [21, 14, 31] assume that the color of ray only relies on the color of an intersection of the ray with the scene geometry which makes the gradient only be backpropagated to a local region near the intersection. Therefore, such methods struggle with reconstructing complex objects with severe self-occlusions, sudden depth changes and thin parts. Furthermore, it requires object masks as supervision. On the contrary, our method performs well for such challenging cases without the need of masks.

Volume rendering based methods, such as NeRF[20], render an image by accumulating colors of the sampled points along each ray. Since during training, the gradient can be back-propagated to every sample points, it can handle sudden depth changes and synthesize high-quality images. However, extracting high-fidelity surface from the learned implicit field is difficult. This is because the density-based scene representation lacks sufficient constraints on level sets of the scene geometry and introduces ambiguities in density. In contrast, our method combines the advantages of surface rendering based and volume rendering based methods by constraining the scene space as a signed distance field and applying volume rendering to render the scene field. UNISURF [22], a concurrent unpublished work, also learns an implicit surface via volume rendering. It improves the reconstruction quality by shrinking the sample region of volume rendering during the optimization. Our method differs from UNISURF in that UNISURF represents the surface by occupancy values and gradually reduces the sample regions at some predefined steps to make the occupancy value converge to the surface while our method represents the scene by a signed distance field (SDF) and thus can naturally extracts the surface as the zero-set of the SDF, yielding better reconstruction accuracy than UNISURF as will be seen later in the Experiment section.

# 3 Method

Given a set of posed images  $\{\mathcal{I}_k\}$  of a 3D object, our goal is to reconstruct the surface  $S$  of the object. The surface is represented by the zero-set of a Signed Distance Function (SDF), which is implicitly encoded by a neural network. In order to learn the parameters of this network, we developed a novel variant of the volume rendering method to render images from the implicit SDF and minimize the difference between the rendered images and the input images to train the network of SDF. This volume rendering approach ensures the robustness of optimization for network training and allows our NeuS method to reconstruct objects of complex structures.

# 3.1 Rendering Procedure

Scene representation. With NeuS, the 3D scene of an object  $O$  to be reconstructed is represented by two functions:  $f:\mathbb{R}^3\to \mathbb{R}$  that maps a point  $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^3$  to its signed distance to  $O$ , and  $c:\mathbb{R}^3\times \mathbb{S}^2\rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}^3$  that encodes the color associated with a point  $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^3$  and a viewing direction  $\mathbf{v}\in \mathbb{S}^2$ . Both functions are implicitly encoded by neural networks of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). The surface of the object  $O$  is represented by the zero-set of its SDF function, that is,

$$
\mathcal {S} = \left\{\mathbf {x} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {3} \mid f (\mathbf {x}) = 0 \right\}. \tag {1}
$$

In order to apply a volume rendering method to training the SDF network, we introduce a density field  $\bar{\phi} (\mathbf{x})$  induced by the signed distance function  $f$ :

$$
\bar {\phi} (\mathbf {x}) = \phi_ {s} (f (\mathbf {x})), \tag {2}
$$

where  $\phi_s(x)$  in principle can be any unimodal, i.e. bell-shaped, density distribution function centered at 0, and the standard deviation of  $\phi_s(x)$  is  $1 / s$ . In this paper, we choose to use  $\phi (x) = se^{-sx} / (1 + e^{-sx})^2$ , commonly known as the logistic density distribution, which is the derivative of the well-known Sigmoid function  $\Phi_s(x) = (1 + e^{-sx})^{-1}$ , i.e.  $\phi (x) = \Phi_s'(x)$ . Note that  $\bar{\phi} (\mathbf{x})$  is a "virtual"

density field devised to facilitate the training of the SDF network via a volume rendering scheme, thus it is different from the radiance field used in the context of volume rendering for translucent objects or participating media.

Intuitively, the main idea of NeuS is that, with the aid of the density field  $\bar{\phi} (\mathbf{x})$ , volume rendering can be used to train the SDF network with the supervision of the 2D input images. Upon successful completion of network optimization,  $\bar{\phi} (\mathbf{x})$  should assume prominently high density values near the object's surface, and it is therefore expected that the zero-set of the network-encoded SDF yields an accurately reconstructed surface  $S$ .

**Rendering.** To learn the parameters of MLPs of the SDF and the color field, we devise a volume rendering scheme to render images from the proposed SDF representation and compare the rendered images with the input images for network supervision. Given a pixel, we denote the ray emitted from this pixel as  $\{\mathbf{p}(t) = \mathbf{o} + t\mathbf{v}|t\geq 0\}$  where  $\mathbf{o}$  is the center of the camera and  $\mathbf{v}$  is the unit direction vector of the ray. We accumulate the colors along the ray by

$$
\hat {C} = \int_ {0} ^ {+ \infty} w (t) c (\mathbf {p} (t), \mathbf {v}) \mathrm {d} t, \tag {3}
$$

where  $\hat{C}$  is the output color for this pixel,  $w(t)$  a weight for the point  $\mathbf{p}(t)$  and  $c(\mathbf{p}(t))$  is the color at the point  $\mathbf{p}$  along the viewing direction  $\mathbf{v}$ . As a weight function, here  $w(t)$  is required to satisfy that  $w(t) \geq 0$  and  $\int_0^{+\infty} w(t) \mathrm{d}t = 1$ .

To evaluate this integral, we use a discrete approximation, which is similar to the composite trapezoid quadrature, by sampling  $n$  points  $\{\mathbf{p}_i = \mathbf{o} + t_i\mathbf{v}|i = 1,\dots,n,t_i < t_{i + 1}\}$  along the ray and computing the approximate color

$$
\hat {C} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} c _ {i}, \tag {4}
$$

where  $w_{i} = w(t_{i})\delta_{i}$ $c_{i} = c(\mathbf{p}(t_{i}),\mathbf{v})$  , and  $\delta_i = t_{i + 1} - t_i$

Clearly, the key to computing an appropriate output color is to derive the weight function  $w(t)$  on the ray based on the SDF function  $f$  of the scene. In the following, we first list the requirements of weight function  $w$ .

Requirements on weight function  $w(t)$ . A valid weight function needs to satisfy the following two properties.

1. Unbiased.  $w(t)$  attains a locally maximal value at depth  $t$  only when  $f(\mathbf{p}(t)) = 0$ , that is, the point  $\{\mathbf{p}(t)\}$  is on the surface defined by the zero-set of the SDF  $(\mathbf{x})$ .  
2. Occlusion-aware. Given any two depth values  $t_0$  and  $t_1$  satisfying  $f(t_0) = f(t_1)$  and  $t_0 < t_1$ , there is  $w(t_0) > w(t_1)$ . That is, when two points have the same SDF value (thus the same SDF-induced density value), the point near the view point should have a larger contribution to the final output color than does a point farther away.

The unbiased property guarantees the reconstructed surface is exactly the zero-set of SDF because the points in the zero-set contributes

most significantly to the output colors. Hence, a training procedure using volume rendering with a unbiased weight function  $w(t)$  ensures that no bias is introduced in the reconstructed surface. The occlusion-aware property ensures that when a ray sequentially passes multiple surfaces, the rendering procedure will correctly use the color of the surface nearest to the camera to compute the output color.

Next, we will first analyze two naive ways of defining the weight function  $w(t)$  before introducing our construction of  $w(t)$ . In fact, we will show that directly using the standard pipeline of volume rendering would produce undesirable bias in surface reconstruction (see Naive Solution 2 below).

Naive solution I. A straightforward way to construct a unbiased weight function is to directly use the density as weight

$$
w _ {i} = \frac {\bar {\phi} (\mathbf {p} \left(t _ {i}\right))}{\sum_ {j} \bar {\phi} (\mathbf {p} \left(t _ {j}\right))}, \tag {5}
$$

Figure 2: Weight bias of trivial solution II.

Obviously this weight function is unbiased but not occlusion-aware. If the ray passes two surfaces, the SDF function  $f$  will have two zero points on the ray, which results in two peaks on the weight function  $w(t)$ . In this case, the resulting weight functions will mix and average the color of two surfaces, producing inaccurate reconstruction of both surfaces.

Naive solution II. To make the weight function occlusion-aware, we may follow the standard volume rendering that sets the alpha (i.e. opacity) to be equal to the density value  $\bar{\phi}(f(\mathbf{p}(t_i))$  and compute the weight values by

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \alpha_ {i} = \bar {\phi} (\mathbf {p} (t _ {i})) \delta_ {i} \\ w _ {i} = \prod_ {k} ^ {i - 1} (1 - \alpha_ {k}) \alpha_ {i} \end{array} \right. \tag {6}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is similar to the opacity concept in volume rendering, which is probability of surface existence on the depth range  $(t_i,t_{i + 1})$ .  $\prod_k^{i - 1}(1 - \alpha_k)$  denotes the probability that ray is not occluded by any depth before  $t_i$ . Obviously, the construction is occlusion-aware since Eq. 6 explicitly considers the occlusion relationship. However, such a construction is not unbiased, as will be proved in the supplementary materials. The intuition of this phenomenon is that  $\alpha_{i}$  is obviously unbiased because  $\alpha (t) = \bar{\phi} (f(\mathbf{p}(t)))$  but the production in Eq. 6 applied on the alpha values will introduce an offset to the final weights, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

Our solution. To construct an occlusion-aware and unbiased weight function, we first consider the case that there is only one surface. In this case, Eq. 5 is correct so we let the weight values satisfy Eq. 5 and then apply Eq. 6 to find the corresponding alpha value for this weight function. Then, we directly generalize these alpha values to compute weight values in all cases, including the case where there are multiple surfaces on the ray. With the aid of Eq. 6, the resulting weight values are actually able to handle the occlusion meanwhile they are also unbiased since they satisfy Eq. 5 around every surface. Specifically, our weight values are defined by

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \alpha \left(t _ {i}\right) = \max  \left(\frac {\Phi_ {s} (- f \left(\mathbf {p} \left(t _ {i + 1}\right)\right)) - \Phi_ {s} (- f \left(\mathbf {p} \left(t _ {i}\right)\right))}{1 - \Phi_ {s} (- f \left(\mathbf {p} \left(t _ {i}\right)\right))}, 0\right) \\ w _ {i} = \prod_ {k} ^ {i - 1} (1 - \alpha_ {k}) \alpha_ {i} \end{array} \right. \tag {7}
$$

where  $\Phi_s(x) = \int \phi(x)$  is the Cumulative Density Function (CDF) of the logistic density distribution  $\phi(x)$  defined in Eq. 2. Therefore,  $\Phi_s(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1}$ , the Sigmoid function.

Due to the utilization of alpha values, the proposed weight function is occlusion-aware. Meanwhile, we have the following theorem to ensure the unbiased property, which is also illustrated in Fig. 3.

Theorem 1 If there exists a visible surface between two depth  $t_0$  and  $t_1$  of a ray, which means the ray is going from the outside of the surface into the inside of the surface with  $f(\mathbf{p}(t_0)) > 0$ ,  $f(\mathbf{p}(t_1)) < 0$  and  $f(\mathbf{p}(t))$  is monotonically decreasing in the range  $(t_0, t_1)$ , then the weight  $w(t)$  computed by Eq. 7 will have a local maxima in this range at the depth  $t$  where  $f(\mathbf{p}(t)) = 0$ .

The proof is left in the supplementary materials. We discuss the intuition behind the design by the example drawn in Fig. 3.

Intuition. Let us consider the case that there is a visible surface between the depth  $t_0$  and the depth  $t_1$ . If we explicitly compute the  $w_i$  in Eq. 7, we can find that

$$
w \left(t _ {i}\right) = \frac {\Phi_ {s} (- f (\mathbf {p} \left(t _ {i + 1}\right))) - \Phi_ {s} (- f (\mathbf {p} \left(t _ {i}\right))}{1 - \Phi_ {s} (- f (\mathbf {p} \left(t _ {0}\right)))}, \tag {8}
$$

where  $\Phi_s(-f(\mathbf{p}(t_0)))$  can be regarded as a constant. In this case, if we regard the density function  $1 - \Phi_s$  as the proportion that the ray can go through the sample point, i.e., transmittance,  $\Phi_s(-f(\mathbf{p}(t_{i + 1}))) - \Phi_s(-f(\mathbf{p}(t_i))$  is actually the probability of a surface that exists in the sampled section  $(t_i,t_{i + 1})$ , i.e., attenuation. So in our solution, we would like to set  $\Phi_s(-f(\mathbf{p}(t_{i + 1}))) - \Phi_s(-f(\mathbf{p}(t_i))$  as the weight value instead of the alpha value in this sampled section, which ensures that the weight value is unbiased.

# 3.2 Training

We optimize our neural networks and inverse standard deviation  $s$  by randomly sample a batch of pixels and their corresponding rays in world space  $P = \{C_k, M_k, \mathbf{o}_k, \mathbf{v}_k\}$ , where  $C_k$  is its color and  $M_k$  is its optional mask, from an image in every iteration. We assume the batch size is  $m$ .

Losses. To optimize the parameters, we define our objective function as:

$$
\mathcal {L} = \mathcal {L} _ {\text {c o l o r}} + \lambda \mathcal {L} _ {\text {r e g}} + \beta \mathcal {L} _ {\text {m a s k}}. \tag {9}
$$

The color loss  $\mathcal{L}_{color}$  is defined as

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {c o l o r}} = \frac {1}{m} \sum_ {k} \mathcal {R} \left(\hat {C} _ {k}, C _ {k}\right). \tag {10}
$$

Same as [31], we empirically choose  $\mathcal{R}$  as L1 loss, which in our observation is robust to outliers and stable to train.

We add an Eikonal term [9] on the sampled points to regularize the network and enforce the outputs  $f_{\theta}$  follow a signed distance field by

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {r e g} = \frac {1}{n m} \sum_ {k, i} \left(\nabla_ {f} \left(\hat {\mathbf {p}} _ {k, i}\right) - 1\right) ^ {2}. \tag {11}
$$

The mask loss  $\mathcal{L}_{mask}$  is an optional term, which is defined as

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {m a s k}} = \operatorname {B C E} \left(M _ {k}, \hat {O} _ {k}\right), \tag {12}
$$

where  $\hat{O}_k = \sum_{i=1}^n T_{k,i} \alpha_{k,i}$  is the sum of weights along the ray  $\mathbf{o}_k + t\mathbf{v}_k$ , and BCE is the binary cross entropy loss.

Hierarchical sampling. Like all other volume rendering techniques, the strategy of sampling will significantly influence the final results. In this work, we follow a similar hierarchical sampling strategy as NeRF [20]. We first uniformly sample the points on the ray and then conduct importance sampling on top of the coarse probability estimation. The difference is that, unlike NeRF which simultaneously optimizes a coarse network and a fine network, we only maintain one network, where probability in coarse sampling is computed by querying the network with a large fixed standard deviation  $1 / s$  while the probability of fine sampling is computed with the network with trainable  $s$ .

# 4 Experiments

# 4.1 Experimental settings.

Datasets. To evaluate our approach and baseline methods, we use 15 scenes from the DTU dataset [10], same as those used in IDR [31], with a wide variety of materials, appearance and geometry including challenging cases for reconstruction algorithms, such as non-Lambertian surfaces and thin structures. Each scene contains 49 or 64 images with the image resolution of  $1600 \times 1200$ . Each scene was tested with and without foreground masks provided by IDR [31]. We further tested on 7 challenging scenes from the low-res set of the BlendedMVS dataset [30](CC-4 License). Each scene has  $31 - 143$  images at  $768 \times 576$  pixels and masks are provided by the BlendedMVS dataset. We further captured two thin objects with 32 input images to test our approach on thin structure reconstruction.

Baselines. (1) The state-of-the-art surface rendering approach – IDR [31]: IDR can reconstruct surface with high quality but requires foreground masks as supervision for training; Since IDR has demonstrated superior quality compared to another surface rendering based method – DVR [21], we did not conduct a comparison with DVR. (2) The state-of-the-art volume rendering approach – NeRF [20]: NeRF achieves impressive results in novel view synthesis, however, extracting high-quality surface is not trivial. We use a density threshold of 25 to extract mesh from the learned implicit field. We validate this choice in the supplemental materials. (3) A widely-used classical MVS method – COLMAP [27]: We reconstruct a mesh from the output point cloud of COLMAP with screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction [13]. (4) The concurrent work which unifies surface rendering and volume rendering with an occupancy field as scene representation – UNISURF [22]. More details of the baseline methods are included in the supplemental material.

Implementation details. Similar to the network architecture of IDR [31], the signed distance function  $f$  is modeled by a MLP that consists of 8 hidden layers with hidden size of 256. The function  $c$  for color prediction is modeled by a MLP with 4 hidden layers with size of 256, which is conditioned on the spatial location  $x$ , normal  $n$ , and the feature vector from  $f$ . Positional encoding [20] is applied to spatial location  $x$  with 6 frequencies and to view direction  $v$  with 4 frequencies. We assume the region of interest is inside a unit sphere. The number of coarse and fine sampling is 64 and 64 respectively. For the 'w/o mask' setting, we sample additional 32 points outside the sphere,

the outside scene is presented using NeRF++ [35]. Geometric initialization is used to produce an approximate SDF as proposed in [1]. We sample 512 rays per batch and train our model for 300k iterations for 14 hours (for the 'w/ mask' setting) and 16 hours (for the 'w/o mask' setting) on a single NVIDIA RTX2080Ti GPU.

# 4.2 Comparisons

same way as UNISURF [22] and IDR [31] and report the scores in Table 1. The results show that our approach outperforms the baseline methods on the DTU dataset in both settings – w/ and w/o mask in terms of the Chamfer distance. Note that the reported scores of IDR in the setting of with mask and NeRF and UNISURF in the w/o mask setting are from IDR [31] and UniSURF [22].

We conduct the qualitative comparisons on the DTU dataset and the BlendedMVS dataset in both settings, w/ mask and w/o mask, in Figure 4 and Figure 6, respectively. As shown in Figure 4 for the setting of w/ mask, IDR shows limited performance for reconstructing thin metals parts in Scan 37 (DTU) and Jade (BlendedMVS), and fails to handle sudden depth changes in Stone (BlendedMVS) due to the local optimization process in surface rendering. The extracted meshes of NeRF's results are noisy since the volume density field has not sufficient constraint on level sets of 3D geometry. Regarding the w/o mask setting, we visually compare our method with

We further show a comparison with UNISURF [22] on two examples in the w/o mask setting. The UNISURF's results are provided by the authors of UNISURF. Our method works better for the objects with abrupt depth changes. More qualitative images and videos are included in the supplementary materials.

# 4.3 Analysis

Ablation study. To evaluate the effect of the weight calculation, We test three different kinds of weight constructions described in Sec. 3.1: (a) Naive solution I. (b) Naive solution II. (d) Full Model. As shown in Figure 7, if naive solution I is used, there are severe artifacts; Although reconstruction

geometry of naive solution II looks plausible, the quantitative result is worse than our weight choice (d) in terms of the Chamfer distance. This is because it introduces a bias to the surface reconstruction.

We also studied the effect of geometric initialization [1]. When the random initialization is used, artifacts appear at nose and eyes of the skull. More analysis can be found in supplementary materials.

Thin structures. We additionally show results on two challenging thin objects with 32 input images. As shown in Fig. 8, our method is able to accurately reconstruct these thin structures, especially on the edges with abrupt depth changes. Note that the plane with rich texture under the object is used for camera calibration.

# 5 Conclusion

We have proposed NeuS, a new approach to multiview surface reconstruction that represents 3D surfaces as neural SDF and developed a new volume rendering method for training the implicit SDF representation. NeuS produces high-quality reconstruction and successfully reconstructs objects with severe occlusion and complex structures. It outperforms the state-of-the-arts both qualitatively and quantitatively. One limitation of our method is that although our method does not heavily rely on correspondence matching of texture features, the performance would still degrade for textureless objects (we show the failure cases in the supplemental materials). Moreover, NeuS has only a single standard deviation parameter  $s$  that is used to model the probability for all the spatial location. Hence, an interesting future research topic is to model the probability with different variances for different spatial locations together with the optimization of scene representation, depending on different local geometric characteristics. Negative societal impact: like many other learning-based works, our method requires a large amount of computational resources for network training, which can be a concern for global climate change.
