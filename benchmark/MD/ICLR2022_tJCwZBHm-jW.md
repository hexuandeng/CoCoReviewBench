Paper under double-blind review

# ABSTRACT

3D point-clouds and 2D images are different visual representations of the physical world. While human vision can understand both representations, computer vision models designed for 2D image and 3D point-cloud understanding are quite different. Our paper explores the potential for transferring between these two representations by empirically investigating the feasibility of the transfer, the benefits of the transfer, and shedding light on why the transfer works. We discovered that we can indeed use the same architecture and pretrained weights of a neural net model to understand both images and point-clouds. Specifically, we can transfer the pretrained image model to a point-cloud model by inflating 2D convolutional filters to 3D and then finetuning the image-pretrained models (FIP). We discover that, surprisingly, models with minimal finetuning efforts — only on input, output, and optionally batch normalization layers, can achieve competitive performance on 3D point-cloud classification, beating a wide range of point-cloud models that adopt task-specific architectures and use a variety of tricks. When finetuning the whole model, the performance further improves significantly. Meanwhile, we also find that FIP improves data efficiency, achieving up to 10.0 points top-1 accuracy gain on few-shot classification. It also speeds up training of point-cloud models by up to  $11.1\mathrm{x}$  to reach a target accuracy.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Point-cloud is an important visual representation for 3D computer vision. It is widely used in applications such as autonomous driving (Behley et al., 2019; Caesar et al., 2020; Yue et al., 2018), robotics (Armeni et al., 2017; Pomerleau et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2021), augmented and virtual reality (Sketchup, 2021; Wu et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015), etc. A point-cloud represents visual information in a highly different way from a 2D image. A point-cloud consists of a set of unordered points lying on object surface, with each point encoding its spatial  $x$ ,  $y$ ,  $z$  coordinates and potentially other features. In contrast, a 2D image organizes visual features as a dense 2D pixel array. Due to the representation differences, 2D image and 3D point-cloud understanding are treated as separate problems. Image models and point-cloud models are designed to have different architectures and are trained on different types of data. Few research efforts have tried to directly transfer models from images to point-clouds or vice versa.

Intuitively, both 3D point-clouds and 2D images are visual representations of the physical world. Their low-level representations are drastically different, but they can represent the same underlying visual concept. Furthermore, human vision has no problem understanding both representations. However, can computer vision models be trained on one modality understand the other?

Somewhat surprisingly, the answer to the question above is: Yes, 2D image models trained on image datasets can be transferred to understand 3D point-clouds with minimal efforts. As illustrated in Figure 1, we transfer a 2D ConvNet to a 3D ConvNet whose input is a 3D voxel representation converted from a point-cloud. Based on a pretrained 2D ConvNet, we inflate its 2D convolutional filters to 3D by copying the filter weights along a third dimension. We add linear input and output layers to the network; and on a target point-cloud dataset, we only finetune the input/output layers and optionally the normalization layers, while keeping the original model weights untouched. We term such partially-finetuned-image-pretrained models as  $FIP-IO$  (finetuning only input and output layer) or  $FIP-IO+BN$  (finetuning input, output, and BN layers). FIP-IO+BN can achieve competitive

Figure 1: We investigate the feasibility of pretrained 2D ConvNets transferring to 3D sparse ConvNets. With filter inflation and finetuning only the input, output layer (classifier for classification task and decoder for semantic segmentation task), and optionally normalization layers, 3D Sparse ConvNets are capable of dealing with point-cloud classification, indoor, and driving scene segmentation.

performance up to  $90.8\%$  top-1 accuracy on the ModelNet 3D Wharehouse dataset, on top a ResNet50, outperforming many previous point-cloud models that adopt task-specific model architectures and tricks.

Most point-cloud models except projection-based models are only trained from scratch. Based on our surprising discovery, we further investigate fully-finetuned-image-pretrained models (termed as FIP-ALL). We observe that FIP-ALL brings significant improvement on top of ResNet series. Besides applying FIP-ALL to voxel-based method, we also find it generalizes to other popular methods, such as point-based method (PointNet++ (Qi et al., 2017)) and projection-based method (SimpleView (Goyal et al., 2021a)), as well as current popular vision transformers (ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)). Specifically, FIP-ALL largely outperforms the training-from-scratch by 0.88, 0.50, 3.50, 4.18 points top-1 accuracy on top of PointNet++, SimpleView, ViT-B-16, and ViT-L-16, respectively. In addition to the performance gain, FIP-ALL exhibits superior data efficiency with up to 10.0 points improvement in few-shot classification on the ModelNet 3D Wharehouse dataset. We also find that comparing with training-from-scratch, FIP-ALL dramatically speeds up the training by using 11.1 times fewer epochs to reach a target validation accuracy.

In order to understand why the image pretraining can be utilized and benefit point-cloud understanding, we conduct experiment to shed light on this by studying the network dissection (Bau et al., 2017), text-shape representation transferring (Geirhos et al., 2018), and distribution distance, hoping these can inspire the research community to explore further.

# 2 RELATED WORK

# 2.1 POINT-CLOUD PROCESSING MODEL

3D convolution-based method is one of the mainstreams in point-cloud processing approaches which efficiently process point-clouds based on voxelization. In particular, in this approach, voxelization is used to rasterize point-clouds into regular grids (called voxels), thus conventional 3D convolutions can be applied. Sparse convolution is proposed to apply on the non-empty voxels (Liu et al., 2015; Choy et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2021), largely improving the efficiency of 3D convolutions.

Projection-based method attempts to project a 3D point-cloud to a 2D plane and uses 2D convolution to extract features (Wang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018; 2019; Xu et al., 2020; Su et al., 2015; Lawin et al., 2017; Boulch et al., 2017). Specifically, the bird-eye-view projection (Yang et al., 2018; Lang et al., 2019) and the spherical projection (Wu et al., 2018; 2019; Xu et al., 2020; Milioto et al., 2019) make great progress in outdoor point-cloud tasks.

Point-based method directly processes the point-cloud data. The most classic methods, PointNet (Qi et al., 2016) and PointNet++ (Qi et al., 2017), consume points by customized feature aggregation. Many works further develop advanced local-feature aggregation operators that mimic the convolution to structure data (Xu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2018b; Hua et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; 2020; Wang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a; Komarichev et al., 2019).

# 2.2 PRETRAINING IN 2D AND 3D VISION

Pretraining in 2D vision has shown effectiveness under supervised (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Girshick et al., 2014), self-supervised (Jing & Tian, 2020; Goyal et al., 2021b), and unsupervised contrastive approach (He et al., 2020; Bachman et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020a; Caron et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020c; Hjelm et al., 2018). After pretraining on a large amount of data, a 2D model requires much fewer computational resources and data for finetuning to reach competitive performance on downstream tasks (Kataoka et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020b; Henaff, 2020).

Pretraining in 3D vision has been studied similarly as pretraining in 2D vision: both self-supervised and contrastive pretraining (Xie et al., 2020) show promising results. Due to the lack of large, annotated point-cloud datasets, pretraining in 3D vision is motivated for data efficiency (Xu & Lee, 2020). Recent works (Hou et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021) consider pretraining methods, for example, Contrastive Scene Contents which making use of both point-level correspondences and spatial contexts, with data efficiency in mind.

# 2.3 CROSS-MODAL TRANSFER LEARNING

Cross-modal transfer learning attempts to take advantage of data from different modalities (Dai & Nießner, 2018; Liu et al., 2021b). For example, Liu et al. (2021a) proposed pixel-to-point knowledge transfer (PPKT) from 2D to 3D which uses aligned RGB and RGB-D images during pretraining. Our work does not rely on joint image-point-cloud pretraining. Instead, we directly transfer an image-pretrained model to point-cloud with the simplest pretraining-finetuning scheme.

Some of the previous works for video and medical images (Carreira & Zisserman, 2017; Shan et al., 2018) have adopted the method of simply extending a pretrained 2D convolutional filter along time or depth direction for transferring to 3D models. Between language and image modality, transfer learning with minimal finetuning also shows a competitive performance (Lu et al., 2021).

# 3 CONVERTING A 2D CONVNET TO A 3D CONVNET

In this paper, we primarily focus on the 3D sparse-convolution based method to process point-clouds because it is flexible to all point-cloud tasks. As discussed in 2.1, we consider a set of points where each point is represented by its 3D coordinates and optionally additional features such as intensity and RGB. We then voxelize/quantize these points into voxels according to their 3D space coordinates, following Choy et al. (2019). A voxel's feature is inherited from the point that lies in the voxel. If there are multiple points in a voxel, then we average all points' feature and assign the mean to the voxel. If there is no point in the voxel, then we simply set the voxel's feature to 0. When using sparse convolution, we skip the computation on empty voxels.

Given a pretrained 2D ConvNet, we convert it to a 3D ConvNet that takes 3D voxels as input. The key element of this procedure is to convert 2D convolution filters to 3D, i.e. constructing 3D filters with the weights directly inherited from 2D filters. A 2D convolutional filter can be represented as a 4D tensor of shape  $[M,N,K,K]$ , representing output dimension, input dimension, and two spatial kernel sizes, respectively. A 3D convolutional filter has an extra dimension, and its shape is  $[M,N,K,K,K]$ . To better illustrate, we ignore the output and input dimensions and only consider a spatial slice of the 2D filter with shape  $[K,K]$ . The simplest way to convert this 2D filter to 3D is to copy the 2D filter and repeat it by  $K$  times along a third dimension. This operation is the same as the inflation technique used by (Carreira & Zisserman, 2017) to initialize a video model with a pretrained 2D ConvNet.

Besides convolution, other operations such as downsampling, BN, nonlinear activation can be easily migrated to 3D. Our 3D model inherits the architecture of the original 2D ConvNet, but we also add a linear layer as the input layer and an output layer depending on the target task. For classification, we

use a global average pooling layer followed by one fully connected layer to get the final prediction. For semantic segmentation, the output layer is a U-Net style decoder (Ronneberger et al., 2015). The architecture of the input/output layers is described in more detail in supplementary A.5.

# 4 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION

To explore the image to point-cloud transfer, we study three settings: 1) partially-finetuned-image-pretrained model, only finetuning input and output layers (FIP-IO), 2) finetuning input, output, and batch normalization layers (FIP-IO+BN), and 3) finetuning the whole pretrained network (FIP-ALL). Under the three settings, we extensively explore the feasibility of transferring the image-pretrained model for point-cloud understanding and the benefits of this. The entire empirical evaluation is organized as four questions: 1) Can we transfer pretrained-image models to recognize point-clouds? (Section 4.1) 2) Can image-pretraining benefit the performance of point-cloud recognition? (Section 4.2) 3) Can image-pretrained model improve the data efficiency on point-cloud recognition? (Section 4.3) 4) Can image-pretrained model accelerate training point-cloud models? (Section 4.4)

Datasets. We benchmark the transferred models on ModelNet 3D Wharehouse classification (Wu et al., 2015), S3DIS indoor segmentation (Armeni et al., 2017), and SemanticKITTI outdoor segmentation (Behley et al., 2019) tasks. ModelNet 3D Wharehouse is a CAD model classification dataset that consists of point-clouds with 40 categories. CAD models in this benchmark come from 3D Warehouse (Sketchup, 2021). In this benchmduiark, we only utilize x, y, z coordinates as features. S3DIS is a dataset collected from real-world indoor scenes and includes 3D scans of Matterport Scanners from 6 areas. It provides point-wise annotations for indoor objects like chair, table, and bookshelf, etc. SemanticKITTI dataset from KITTI Vision Odometry (Geiger et al., 2012) is a driving scene dataset. It provides dense point-wise annotations for the complete 360 degrees field-of-view of the deployed automotive lidar, which is currently one of the most challenging datasets.

ResNet (He et al., 2016a) series is used mostly throughout our experiments. Depending on the experiments, ResNets are pretrained on Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K (Deng et al., 2009), and Fractal database (FractalDB) (Kataoka et al., 2020). Our pretrained models are directly downloaded from various sources, with detailed links provided in Section A.1. To study the benefits of using pretrained image models, we also utilize PointNet++ (Qi et al., 2017), ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), and SimpleView (Goyal et al., 2021a) as our baselines.

# 4.1 CAN WE TRANSFER PRETRAINED-IMAGE MODELS TO RECOGNIZE POINT-CLOUDS?

To evaluate the feasibility of transferring pretrained 2D image models to 3D point-cloud tasks, we conduct experiments on top of the ResNet series since there are abundant open-source pretrained ResNet available. In particular, we convert 2D ConvNets into 3D ConvNets using the procedure described in Section 3. We hypothesize that, if a pretrained 2D image model is capable of understanding point-clouds directly, we can see an nontrivial performance by only finetuning input and output layers of the transferred model. Further, as we gradually relax the frozen parameters—finetuning BN parameters as well, the transferred model can achieve better performance, even surpassing training-from-scratch performance.

We conduct two groups of experiments with FIP-IO and FIP-IO+BN, with the results shown in Figure 2. The first is to inflate ResNet50 pretrained from different image datasets, including Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet1K, ImageNet21K, FractalDB1K and FractalDB10K, and evaluate on the ModelNet 3D Wharehouse.

We surprisingly discovered that, even if we only finetune the input and output layers while keeping the image-pretrained weights freezed, the FIP-IO pretrained from ImageNet1K, FractalDB1K and FractalDB10K achieve competitive performance. Specifically, ResNet50 FIP-IO performance with ImageNet1K pretraining outperforms 3D ShapeNet (Wu et al., 2015) and DeepPano (Shi et al., 2015), which were the state-of-the-arts in 2015, by 4.2 and 3.6 points respectively in top-1 accuracy on ModelNet 3D Wharehouse. More importantly, with ImageNet21K pretrained model, ResNet50 FIP-IO+BN surpass training-from-scratch by 0.48 points, even beating a variety of well-known methods including PointNet (Qi et al., 2016), MVCNN (Su et al., 2015), DGCNN (Wang et al., 2019), KDNet (Klokov & Lempitsky, 2017), etc.

The second group of experiments are based on different ResNets, as shown in the right figure of Figure 2. All the ResNet models are pretrained on ImageNet1K. We observe that FIP-IO+BN on top of different ResNet models is highly competitive to training-from-scratch, and FIP-IO+BN on top of ResNet152 is even better than training-from-scratch by 0.16 points top-1 accuracy.

Therefore, we surprisingly found out the answer of "Can we transfer pretrained-image models to recognize point-clouds?": Yes, the pretrained 2D image models can be directly used for recognizing point-cloud. It is also noteworthy that the pretraining dataset is not restricted to natural but also synthetic images like those in FractalDB1K/10K.

# 4.2 CAN IMAGE-PRETRAINING BENEFIT POINT-CLOUD RECOGNITION?

From the previous subsection, we find surprising that image-pretrained model can be directly used for point-cloud understanding. In this subsection, we investigate whether image-pretrained model is helpful to improve the performance on point-cloud tasks. We use different baselines, including voxelization-based method (simply ResNet), point-based method (PointNet++ (Qi et al., 2017)), projection-based method (SimpleView (Goyal et al., 2021a)), and current popular transformer-based

method (ViT-B-16 and ViT-L-16 (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)). We fully finetune them on three point-cloud datasets: classification on ModelNet 3D Wharehouse, indoor scene segmentation on S3DIS, and outdoor scene segmentation on SemanticKITTI, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2.

For PointNet++, we use ImageNet1K to pretrain: we break each image into pixels and regard it as a point-cloud. For ViT, we directly use the open-source pretrained model and finetune it on ModelNet 3D Wharehouse. All the implementation details are illustrated in supplementary A. 1.

Table 1 presents performance on ModelNet 3D Wharehouse dataset. We observe that FIP-ALL steadily and significantly improves all the baselines. With pretraining, deeper models improve more. For example, ResNet18 can be only improved by  $0.13\%$  top-1 accuracy, but pretraining on ImageNet1K leads to 0.81 points top-1 accuracy improvement on top of ResNet152. Moreover, larger pretrained datasets also bring larger performance gain. Specifically, ResNet50 FIP-ALL from ImageNet21K can reach  $91.05\%$  top-1 acc, with 0.73 points improvement over training-from-scratch. Such FIP-ALL significantly outperforms a series of well-known methods such as (Qi et al., 2016; 2017; Klokov & Lempitsky, 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Su et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018a).

We also explore FIP-ALL on different architectures, as shown in the second group of Table 1. In particular, FIP-ALL on top of PointNet++, ViT-B-16, ViT-L-16 and SimpleView with image dataset pretraining improve the training-from-scratch by 0.88, 3.50, 4.18, 0.50 points, respectively. Especially for the current superior baseline in image recognition, ViT-B-16 and ViT-L-16, the improved performance is quite significant, revealing the huge potential of using image-pretrained models for point cloud recognition.

For the challenging indoor and outdoor scene segmentation, using ImageNet1K pretrained models (FIP-ALL on ImageNet1K) also consistently improve the training-from-scratch, as shown in Table 2. PointNet++ (resp. ResNet18) pretrained on ImageNet1K outperforms the training-from-scratch by 2.56 points (resp. 1.53 points) mIoU on S3DIS dataset. For SemanticKITTI, we utilize the commonly used projection-based method with 2D ConvNet HRNet. With ImageNet1K pretraining, we observe 3.41 points mIoU improvement, a large margin in such a difficult task. Since HRNetV2-W48 has rich pretrained models, we finetune Cityscapes pretrained HRNetV2-W48 and observe this enhances more (5.25% mIoU improvement over training from scratch). Even for the ResNet18 with a high from-scratch performance of 64.75% mIoU, the ImageNet1K pretraining can also bring 0.82 points mIoU improvement.

Therefore, the answer to "Can image-pretraining benefit point-cloud recognition" is Yes. Image-pretraining can indeed improve point-cloud recognition, which can generalize to a wide range of backbones as well as benefit more challenging tasks.

# 4.3 CAN IMAGE-PRETRAINED MODEL IMPROVE THE DATA EFFICIENCY ON POINT-CLOUD RECOGNITION?

Data efficiency is extremely important in point-cloud understanding due to the huge labor of collecting and annotating point-cloud data. In this subsection, we investigate whether the image-pretrained model can help to improve the data efficiency by conducting few-shot setting experiments, including 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot. We conduct 3 trials for each setting and report the results as mean  $\pm$  std.

In detail, for each class (ModelNet 3D Wharehouse involves 40 classes), we randomly choose a few point-clouds as training data, and still evaluate on the whole test set. We compare the results between training-from-scratch and FIP-ALL pretrained on the ImageNet1K dataset. The experimental results are shown in Table 3. We observe that FIP-ALL dramatically surpasses training-from-scratch on the low data regime (1-shot): pretraining on ImageNet1K brings 10.0, 6.0, and 9.9 points top-1 accuracy

improvement for ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet152, respectively. For 5-shot and 10-shot settings, using ImageNet1K pretraining can still consistently improve the performance. However, we also observe that as the amount of training data increases, the performance gain becomes saturated.

Therefore, our answer to "Can image-pretrained model improve the data efficiency on point-cloud recognition?" is: Yes. Image-pretrained model can improve the data efficiency on point-cloud recognition, especially on the low data regime. When the training data increases, it can still improve the performance, but the gain becomes marginal.

# 4.4 CAN IMAGE-PRETRAINED MODEL ACCELERATE POINT-CLOUD TRAINING?

We also investigate whether image-pretrained model can help point-cloud task train faster. The results are shown in Figure 3.

We find that surprisingly, after training only one epoch on ModelNet 3D Wharehouse dataset, FIP-ALL on ImageNet1K achieves very impressive performance yet the performance of trainingfrom-scratch is still at a low level. For example, after the first epoch, ResNet50 (resp. ResNet152) with training from scratch can only achieve  $28.48\%$  (resp.  $13.94\%$ ) top-1 accuracy while ResNet50 (resp. ResNet152) with ImageNet1K pretraining reaches  $80.11\%$  (resp.  $79.34\%$ ) top-1 accuracy. Moreover, to reach  $90\%$  top-1 accuracy, a non-trivial performance, FIP-ALL significantly accelerates the training by  $2.14x$  (28 vs. 60 epoch),  $11.1x$  (11 vs. 122 epoch),  $2.95x$  (19 vs. 56 epoch) over training-from-scratch, on top of ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet152, respectively.

Therefore, our answer to "Can image-pretrained model accelerate point-cloud training?" is still: Yes. The image-pretrained model can significantly accelerate the training speed of point-cloud tasks.

# 5 DISCUSSION

In this section, we attempt to shed light on why transferring image-pretrained models for point-cloud understanding works. Inspired by recent related works (Geirhos et al., 2018; Brendel & Bethge, 2019; He et al., 2015; 2016b; Bau et al., 2017), we explore this from the aspects of the network dissection, texture-shape representation transferring, the distance between feature distributions.

# 5.1 WHAT DOES THE PRETRAINED-IMAGE MODEL TRANSFER TO POINT-CLOUD MODEL?

Does the image-pretrained model transfer the visual concepts? Inspired by the network dissection for 2D Broden dataset (Bau et al., 2017), we also attempt to explore what the transferred units are looking at in the ModelNet 3D Warehouse dataset. We present the visualization of FIP-IO+BN pretrained on ImageNet1K. The visualization is to show the most activated cases when the whole dataset passes through each unit of the last model stage, as displayed in Figure 4. More visualization

Figure 4: Network Dissection of FIP-IO+BN. The visualization displays what the units are looking at on both image dataset and ModelNet 3D Wharehouse dataset.

can be found in supplementary 5. From the visualization alone, we do not get obvious cues of what visual concepts are transferred between the two modalities. For example, unit 161 strongly activating to computer screens in the Broden, yet it is looking at cars and shelves in the ModelNet 3D Wharehouse. However, we unexpectedly find that the pretrained units are prone to cluster similar objects. In fact, such clustering ability is an important cue of performing well on classification tasks (Hartigan & Wong, 1979; Caron et al., 2021).

Does pretrained-image model transfer shape or texture representation? Recent work (Geirhos et al., 2018) proposed that models learn texture and shape from ImageNet. We follow this direction to further explore what pretrained-image mode transfers. For the experiment, we take two image-pretrained models with either more of the shape or texture representation and compare the FIP-IO performance.

To force the model to acquire more shape representation, (Geirhos et al., 2018) stylizes the images in ImageNet into artwork style, such that the models trained on that are confused by variant textures, hence having stronger shape representation. We directly take the pretrained ResNet50 on stylized ImageNet as the stronger shape representation model.

To get a stronger texture representation model, we are inspired by BagNet (Brendel & Bethge, 2019). By controlling the receptive field, BagNet breaks the shape in a image and focuses more on the texture information. Our experimental result is shown in Table 4. BagNet17 means the size of attended patches is  $17 \times 17$ , and BagNet33 means the size of attended patches is  $33 \times 33$ . Note that after inflating the BagNet17 and BagNet33, both of the architectures are totally as same as the inflated ResNet50. Besides, both BagNet17/33 and ResNet pretrained on stylized-ImageNet1K perform worse than the original ResNet50 on ImageNet classification (Geirhos et al., 2018; Brendel & Bethge, 2019).

We can observe that the ResNet50 FIP-IO on Stylized-ImageNet (with stronger shape representation) outperforms the baseline ResNet50 FIP-IO on ImageNet1K over 2.32 points top-1 accuracy, while both inflated BagNets performs dramatically worse than the baseline. This shows that the shape representations are better transferred from image to point-cloud modality.

# 5.2 WHY DOES FINETUNING BATCH NORMALIZATION HELP THE TRANSFERRING?

Our experiment in Figure 2 shows that finetuning BN, in addition to the input and output layer, can greatly improve the transfer performance compared with only finetuning input/output. It is interesting why such a small part of the network, in terms of parameter size and FLOPs, can have a big impact.

We hypothesize that batch normalization layers shift and scale the feature distribution. To measure the effect, we leverage the first-wasserstein distance (Rubner et al., 2000), a way to calculate the distance between distributions. For estimating the feature distribution of the pretrained-image model, we pass the whole ImageNet1K dataset into the pretrained-image models, collect the pre-activation features after each convolution layer, then sample 15,000 data points from the element-wise distribution of collected features (we assume the pre-activation features present Gaussian distribution). For the ModelNet 3D Wharehouse dataset, we use FIP-IO, FIP-IO+BN, and FIP-ALL to conduct the same operation on the ModelNet 3D Wharehouse dataset and also collect 15,000 data points. We then calculate the FWD between the element-wise feature distribution of image-pretrained model's and each of the FIP-IO, FIP-IO+BN, FIP-ALL model's. The example results are shown in Table. 5. We observe that, the FWD between FIP-IO (point-cloud features) and image model (image features) is very large, yet after finetuning batch normalization layers, the distance is dramatically reduced. This suggests that batch normalization plays a critical role of transferring the point-cloud representation to be closer to the image representation.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this work, we use finetuned-image-pretrained models (FIP) to explore the feasibility of transferring the image-pretrained model for point-cloud understanding, and the benefits of using image-pretrained models on point-cloud tasks. We surprisingly discover that, with simply inflating a 2D pretrained ConvNet and minimal finetuning — input, output, and optionally batch normalization layer (FIP-IO or FIP-IO+BN), the image pretrained models can achieve very competitive performance on 3D point-cloud classification, even beating a wide range of point-cloud models that adopt a variety of tricks. Moreover, we find that when finetuning all the parameters of the pretrained models (FIP-ALL), the performance can be significantly improved on point-cloud classification, indoor and outdoor scene segmentation. Full finetuning generalizes to most of the popular point-cloud methods. Besides, we also find that FIP-ALL can improve the data efficiency on few-shot learning, and accelerate the training speed by a large margin. After this, we shed light on why the image-pretrained model can be used for point-cloud understanding from three aspects, network dissection, texture-shape representation transferring, feature distribution distance. Compared with previous works that seek improvements from designing architectures and pretraining only on the point-cloud modality, our work is not limited by the architecture design and small scale point-cloud dataset. We believe that image pretraining is one of the solutions to the bottleneck of point-cloud understanding and do hope this direction can inspire the research community in the future.
