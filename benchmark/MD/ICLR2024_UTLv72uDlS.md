# ABSTRACT

This paper introduces a model-based approach for training parameterized policies for an autonomous agent operating in a highly nonlinear (albeit deterministic) environment. We desire the trained policy to ensure that the agent satisfies specific task objectives and safety constraints, both expressed in Signal Temporal Logic. We assert that this learning problem is similar to training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the number of recurrent units is proportional to the temporal horizon of the agent's task objectives. This poses a challenge: RNNs are susceptible to vanishing and exploding gradients, and naive gradient descent-based strategies to solve long-horizon task objectives thus suffer from the same problems. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel gradient approximation algorithm based on the idea of gradient sampling, and a smooth computation graph that provides a neurosymbolic encoding of STL formulas. We show that these two methods combined improve the quality of the stochastic gradient, enabling scalable backpropagation over long time horizon trajectories. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on various motion planning applications requiring complex spatiotemporal and sequential tasks ranging over thousands of time steps.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Learning-based approaches to synthesize control policies for highly nonlinear dynamical systems are prevalent across diverse domains, from autonomous vehicles to robots. Popular ways to train NN-based controllers include deep reinforcement learning (RL)(Berducci et al., 2021; Li et al., 2017; Chua et al., 2018; Srinivasan et al., 2020; Velasquez et al., 2021) and deep imitation learning (Fang et al., 2019). Techniques to synthesize neural controllers (including deep RL methods) largely focus on optimizing user-defined rewards or costs, but do not directly address specific spatio-temporal task objectives. For example, consider the objective that the system must reach region  $R_{1}$  before reaching region  $R_{2}$ , while avoiding an obstacle region. Such spatio-temporal task objectives can be expressed in the formalism of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) (Maler & Nickovic, 2004). Furthermore, for any STL specification and a system trajectory, we can efficiently compute the robustness degree, or the approximate signed distance of the trajectory from the set of trajectories satisfying/violating the specification (Donze & Maler, 2010; Fainekos et al., 2009).

The use of STL-based objectives has seen considerable recent interest in data-driven methods for training controllers for dynamical systems that can be described by (stochastic) difference equations. This literature brings together two separate threads: (1) smooth approximations to the robustness degree of STL specifications (Gilpin et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2017) enabling the use of STL robustness in gradient-based learning of control policies, and (2) efficient representation of the robustness computation allowing its use in training neural controllers using backpropagation (Yaghoubi & Fainekos, 2019; Leung et al., 2019; 2021; Hashemi et al., 2023; Hashemi et al.). We are inspired by the work in (Hashemi et al., 2023) that proposes a ReLU-based neural network encoding (called STL2NN) to exactly encode the STL robustness degree computation. We show how we can extend this computation graph to obtain smooth underapproximations of the STL robustness degree. Backpropagation-based methods typically treat the one-step environment dynamics and the neural controller as a recurrent unit that is then unrolled as many times as required by the temporal horizon of the specification  $\varphi$ . For instance, if enforcing  $\varphi$  requires reasoning over several hundred time-steps, then it involves training a recurrent structure that resembles RNN with hundreds of recurrent units. It is well-known that training of RNNs over long sequences faces problems of exploding and vanishing

gradients (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Ba et al., 2016). To address this, we propose a sampling-based approximation of the gradient of the objective function (i.e. the STL property), that is particularly effective when dealing with behaviors over large time-horizons. Our method can improve training of NN controllers by at least an order of magnitude, i.e., in some cases, we reduce training times from hours to minutes. Several planning problems require finding optimal paths over long time-horizons. For example, consider the problem of planning the trajectory of a UAV in a complex, GPS-denied urban environment; here, it is essential that the planned trajectory span several minutes while avoiding obstacles and reaching several sequential goals (Windhorst et al., 2021).

Contributions. To summarize, we make the following contributions:

1. We propose smooth versions of computation graphs representing the robustness degree computation of an STL specification over the trajectory of a dynamical system. Our computation graph guarantees that it lower bounds the robustness degree with a tunable degree of approximation.  
2. We develop a backpropagation framework which leverages the new differentiable structure, and we show how we can handle STL specifications.  
3. We develop a sampling-based approach to approximate the gradient of STL robustness w.r.t. the NN controller parameters. Emphasizing the time steps that contribute the most to the gradient, our method randomly samples time points over the trajectory. We utilize the structure of the STL formula and the current system trajectory to decide which time-points represent critical information for the gradient.  
4. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on high dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems involving long-horizon and dynamic temporal specifications.

Related Work. The use of temporal logic specifications for controller synthesis is a well-studied problem. Early work focuses on the model-based setting, where the environment dynamics are described either as Markov decision processes (Sadigh & Kapoor, 2016; Haesaert et al., 2018) or as differential equations (Gilpin et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2018; Raman et al., 2014; Farahani et al., 2015; Lindemann & Dimarogonas, 2018; Raman et al., 2015; Kalagarla et al., 2020; Lacerda et al., 2015; Guo & Zavlanos, 2018)). Recent years have also seen growing interest in data-driven techniques (Balakrishnan et al., 2022; Li et al., 2018) for control synthesis. In addition, automata-based approaches (Sadigh et al., 2014; Hasanbeig et al., 2018; Hahn et al., 2020; Lavaei et al., 2020) are also proposed in the field to address temporal logic based objectives. In (Liu et al., 2021), the authors propose an imitation learning framework where a Model-Predictive Controller (MPC) guaranteed to satisfy an STL specification is used as a teacher to train a recurrent neural network (RNN). In (Wang et al., 2023; Balakrishnan & Deshmukh, 2019), the authors replace handcrafted reward functions with the STL robustness within single-agent or multi-agent deep RL frameworks. The overall approach of this paper is the closest to the work in (Yaghoubi & Fainekos, 2019; Leung et al., 2019; 2021; Hashemi et al., 2023; Hashemi et al.), where STL robustness is used in conjunction with backpropagation to train controllers. The work in this paper makes significant strides in extending previous approaches to handle very long horizon temporal tasks, crucially enabled by the novel sampling-based gradient approximations. Due to the structure of our NN-controlled system, we can seamlessly handle time-varying dynamics and complex temporal dependencies.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce the notation and the problem definition. We propose our learning-based control synthesis algorithms in Sec. 3, present experimental evaluation in Sec. 4, and conclude in Sec. 5

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

We use bold letters to indicate vectors and vector-valued functions, and calligraphic letters to denote sets. We denote the set,  $\{1,2,\dots ,n\}$  with  $[n]$ . A feed forward neural network (NN) with  $\ell$  hidden layers is denoted by the array  $[n_0,n_1,\dots n_{\ell +1}]$ , where  $n_0$  denotes the number of inputs,  $n_{\ell +1}$  is the number of outputs and for all  $i\in [\ell ]$ ,  $n_i$  denotes the width of  $i^{th}$  hidden layer.

Neural Network Controlled Dynamical Systems (NNCS). Let  $\mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{R}^n$  and  $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^m$  denote the state and action variables that take values from compact sets  $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$  and  $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ , respectively. We use  $\mathbf{s}_k$  (resp.  $\mathbf{a}_k$ ) to denote the value of the state (resp. action) at time  $k$ . We define a neural network

controlled system (NNCS) as a recurrent difference equation.

$$
\mathbf {s} _ {k + 1} = \mathbf {f} \left(\mathbf {s} _ {k}, \mathbf {a} _ {k}\right). \tag {1}
$$

We assume that the control policy is a parameterized function  $\pi_{\theta}$ , where  $\theta$  is a vector of parameters that takes values in  $\Theta$ . Later in the paper, we instantiate the specific parametric form using a neural network for the controller. Given a fixed vector of parameters  $\theta$ , the parametric control policy  $\pi_{\theta}$  returns an action  $\mathbf{a}_k$  as a function of the current state  $\mathbf{s}_k \in S$  and time  $k \in \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0}$ , or  $\mathbf{a}_k = \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_k, k)$ .

Closed-loop Model Trajectory. For a discrete-time NNCS as shown in equation 1, and a set of designated initial states  $\mathcal{I} \subseteq S$ , under a pre-defined feedback policy  $\pi_{\theta}$ , equation 1 represents an autonomous discrete-time dynamical system. For a given initial state  $\mathbf{s}_0 \in \mathcal{I}$ , a system trajectory  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$  is a function mapping time instants in  $[0, K]$  to  $\mathcal{S}$ , where  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta(0) = \mathbf{s}_0$ , and for all  $k \in [0, K-1]$ ,  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta(k+1) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{s}_k, \pi_\theta(\mathbf{s}_k, k))^1$ . The computation graph for this trajectory is a recurrent structure. Appendix K shows an illustration of this structure and its similarity to RNN. In this paper, we provide algorithms to learn a policy  $\pi_{\theta^*}$  that maximizes the degree to which certain task objectives and safety constraints are satisfied. To that end, we formulate policy learning as an optimization problem.

Task Objectives and Safety Constraints. We assume that task objectives or safety constraints of the system are specified in a temporal logic known as Signal Temporal Logic (STL)(Maler & Nickovic, 2004). Our STL formulas are defined using the following syntax:

$$
\varphi = h (\mathbf {s}) \bowtie 0 \mid \varphi_ {1} \wedge \varphi_ {2} \mid \varphi_ {1} \vee \varphi_ {2} \mid \mathbf {F} _ {I} \varphi \mid \mathbf {G} _ {I} \varphi \mid \varphi_ {1} \mathbf {U} _ {I} \varphi_ {2} \tag {2}
$$

that are limited to positive normal form logical expressions. Here,  $\triangleright \in \{\leq , < , > , \geq \}$ ,  $h$  is a function from  $\mathcal{S}$  to  $\mathbb{R}$ , and  $I$  is a closed interval  $[a,b] \subseteq [0,K]$ . The formal semantics of STL over discrete-time trajectories have been previously discussed in (Fainekos & Pappas, 2006), we briefly recall them here.

Boolean Semantics and Formula Horizon. We denote the formula  $\varphi$  being true at time  $k$  in trajectory  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$  by  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$ ,  $k \models \varphi$ . We say that  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$ ,  $k \models h(\mathbf{s}) \bowtie 0$  iff  $h(\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta(k)) \bowtie 0$ . The semantics of the Boolean operations  $(\land, \lor)$  follow standard logical semantics of conjunctions and disjunctions, respectively. For temporal operators, we say  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$ ,  $k \models \mathbf{F}_I\varphi$  is true if there is a time  $k'$  that  $k' - k \in I$  where  $\varphi$  is true. Similarly,  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$ ,  $k \models \mathbf{G}_I\varphi$  is true iff  $\varphi$  is true for all  $k'$  where  $k' - k \in I$ . In addition,  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$ ,  $k \models \varphi_1\mathbf{U}_I\varphi_2$  if there is a time,  $k'$ ,  $k' - k \in I$  where  $\varphi_2$  is true and for all times  $k'' \in [k, k')$ $\varphi_1$  is true. The temporal scope or horizon of an STL formula defines the number of time-steps required in a trajectory to evaluate the formula,  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$ ,  $0 \models \varphi$  (Maler & Nickovic, 2004). For example, the temporal scope of the formula  $\mathbf{F}_{[0,3]}(x > 0)$  is 3, and that of the formula  $\mathbf{F}_{[0,3]}\mathbf{G}_{[0,9]}(x > 0)$  is  $3 + 9 = 12$ .

Quantitative Semantics (Robustness value) of STL. Quantitative semantics of STL roughly define a signed distance of a given trajectory from the set of trajectories satisfying or violating the given STL formula. There are many alternative semantics proposed in the literature (Donzé & Maler, 2010; Fainekos & Pappas, 2006; Rodionova et al., 2022; Akazaki & Hasuo, 2015); in this paper, we focus on the semantics from (Donzé & Maler, 2010) that are shown below. The robustness value  $\rho(\varphi, \sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta, k)$  of an STL formula  $\varphi$  over a trajectory  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$  at time  $k$  is defined recursively as follows<sup>2</sup>.

<table><tr><td>φ</td><td>ρ(φ, k)</td></tr><tr><td>h(sk) ≥ 0</td><td>h(sk)</td></tr><tr><td>φ1 ∧ φ2</td><td>min(ρ(φ1, k), ρ(φ2, k))</td></tr><tr><td>φ1 ∨ φ2</td><td>max(ρ(φ1, k), ρ(φ2, k))</td></tr><tr><td>G[a,b]ψ</td><td>min_{k&#x27; ∈ [k + a, k + b]} ρ(ψ, k)</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>φ</td><td>ρ(φ,k)</td></tr><tr><td>F[a,b]ψ</td><td>maxk&#x27;∈[k+a,k+b] ρ(ψ,k)</td></tr><tr><td>φ1U[a,b]φ2</td><td>maxk&#x27;∈[k+a,k+b] (min{ρ(φ2,k&#x27;), min{k&#x27;&#x27;∈[k,k&#x27;]}ρ(φ1,k&#x27;&#x27;)}</td></tr></table>

We note that if  $\rho (\varphi ,k) > 0$  the STL formula  $\varphi$  is satisfied at time  $k$ , and we say that the formula  $\varphi$  is satisfied by a trajectory if  $\rho (\varphi ,0) > 0$ .

STL Robustness as a ReLU NN. The quantitative semantics in equation 3 contains min/max operators; this makes the robustness of an STL formula difficult to be used in gradient-based methods for learning.

However, min / max operators in equation 3 can be expressed using ReLU functions as follows:

$$
\min  \left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}\right) = a _ {1} - \operatorname {R e L U} \left(a _ {1} - a _ {2}\right), \quad \max  \left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}\right) = a _ {2} + \operatorname {R e L U} \left(a _ {1} - a _ {2}\right). \tag {4}
$$

This allows the computation graph representing the robustness of an STL formula w.r.t. a given trajectory to be expressed using repeated application of the ReLU function (with due diligence in balancing min, max computations over several arguments into a tree of at most logarithmic height in the number of operands). We call this ReLU-based computation graph as STL2NN. The STL2NN, despite being reformulated with ReLU, is essentially equivalent to non-smooth robustness in equation 3, making it unsuitable for back-propagation. To address this, smooth activations are introduced to create a differentiable computation graph.

# 3 TRAINING NEURAL NETWORK CONTROL POLICIES

Problem Definition.: We wish to learn a neural network (NN) control policy  $\pi_{\theta}$  (or equivalently the parameter values  $\theta$ ), s.t. for any initial state  $\mathbf{s}_0 \in \mathcal{I}^3$ , using the control policy  $\pi_{\theta}$ , the trajectory obtained, i.e.,  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$  satisfies a given STL formula  $\varphi$ .

Our solution strategy is to treat each time-step of the given dynamical equation in equation 1 as a recurrent unit. We then sequentially compose or unroll as many units as required by the horizon of the STL specification. For instance, if the specification is  $\mathbf{F}_{[0,10]}(x > 0)$ , then, we use 10 instances of  $f(\mathbf{s}_k,\pi_\theta (\mathbf{s}_k))$  by setting the output of the  $k^{th}$  unit to be the input of the  $(k + 1)^{th}$  unit. This unrolled structure implicitly contains the system trajectory,  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$  starting from some initial state  $\mathbf{s}_0$  of the system. The unrolled structure essentially represents the symbolic trajectory, where each recurrent unit shares the NN parameters of the controller (see Appendix K for more detail). By composing this structure with the neural network representing the given STL specification  $\varphi$ ; for instance, the STL2NN computation graph introduced in the previous section, we have a NN that maps the initial state of the system in equation 1 to the robustness degree of  $\varphi$ . Thus, training the parameters of this resulting NN to guarantee that its output is positive (for all initial states) guarantees that each system trajectory satisfies  $\varphi$ . However, we face two main challenges in training such a NN.

Challenge 1: The cost function to be optimized is the output of the STL2NN computation graph. As mentioned earlier, as this is identical to the non-smooth robustness proposed in equation 3, we cannot use it effectively with stochastic optimization frameworks. An obvious step is to approximate STL2NN by a smooth function. We represent this function as STL2LB and leverage it for computing the gradients of the robustness function. It is important for STL2LB to lower bound STL2NN; if we find NN parameters that guarantee a positive output of STL2LB for all possible system trajectories, then it guarantees that the system satisfies the given STL objective.

Challenge 2: As our model can be thought of as a recurrent structure with number of repeated units proportional to the horizon of the formula, naive gradient-based training algorithms are applicable to only short time horizons. As our structure is recurrent, the gradient computation faces the same issues of vanishing and exploding gradients when dealing with long trajectories that RNNs may face in training (Pascanu et al., 2013). We introduce an efficient technique to approximate gradients for long trajectories that is inspired by the idea of Drop-out (Srivastava et al., 2014). This popular technique also suggests us calling this approximate gradient as robust gradient.

# 3.1 SMOOTH, GUARANTEED LOWER BOUND FOR STL2NN

To guarantee a smooth lower bound for STL2NN, we replace ReLU activations in the min operation with the softmax activation function defined as:

$$
\operatorname {s o f t p l u s} \left(a _ {1} - a _ {2}\right) = \frac {1}{b} \log \left(1 + e ^ {b \left(a _ {1} - a _ {2}\right)}\right), b > 0.
$$

Similarly we replace the ReLU activation functions contributing in max operation with the swish activation function:

$$
\mathsf {s w i s h} (a _ {1} - a _ {2}) = \frac {a _ {1} - a _ {2}}{1 + e ^ {- b (a _ {1} - a _ {2})}}, b > 0.
$$

We denote this smooth NN with STL2LB and we claim: (see Appendix J for more detail)

$$
\forall \left(\sigma_ {\mathbf {s} _ {0}}, b\right) \in \mathbb {R} ^ {n K} \times \mathbb {R}: \mathrm {S T L 2 L B} \left(\sigma_ {\mathbf {s} _ {0}}; b\right) \leq \mathrm {S T L 2 N N} \left(\sigma_ {\mathbf {s} _ {0}}\right)
$$

We note that replacing the min and max operators with smooth versions is, by itself, not novel. Several prior studies have explored smooth semantics for STL (Gilpin et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2017). For example, consider the smooth max and min introduced in (Gilpin et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021; Leung et al., 2019; Lindemann & Dimarogonas, 2018):

$$
\widetilde {\operatorname {m a x}} \left(a _ {1}, \dots , a _ {\ell}\right) = \underbrace {\frac {1}{b} \log \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\ell} e ^ {b a _ {i}}\right)} _ {\text {L o g e x p s u m}} \quad \text {o r} \quad \widetilde {\operatorname {m a x}} \left(a _ {1}, \dots , a _ {\ell}\right) = \underbrace {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\ell} \frac {a _ {i} e ^ {b a _ {i}}}{\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\ell} e ^ {b a _ {i}}}} _ {\text {B o l t z m a n n}}. \tag {5}
$$

and  $\widetilde{\mathrm{min}}(a_1, \cdots, a_\ell) = -\widetilde{\mathrm{max}}(-a_1, \cdots, -a_\ell)$ .

An issue with using any kind of smooth approximation is that numerical issues can be caused by the presence of large positive exponents. Here, we explain this with an example.

Example 1. Let  $a_1 = 0$ , and  $a_2 = 80$ , and suppose we wish to perform a smooth approximation of  $\max(a_1, a_2)$  with Logexpsum, Boltzmann and swish operators. Let the parameter  $b = 10$ . Then we can see that computing  $\exp(ba_2)$  and  $\exp(-b(a_1 - a_2))$  causes numerical issues. On the other hand, for  $a_1 = 80$ ,  $a_2 = 0$  the softplus operator may also fail.

Hence, to resolve the computation problem, we can define a threshold  $\tau > 0$  large enough and approximate swish and softplus activation functions as:

$$
\widetilde {\mathsf {s w i s h}} (\zeta) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \mathsf {s w i s h} (\zeta) & \text {i f} \zeta > - \tau / b \\ 0 & \text {i f} \zeta <   - \tau / b \end{array} \right., \qquad \widetilde {\mathsf {s o f t p l u s}} (\zeta) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \zeta & \text {i f} \zeta > \tau / b \\ \mathsf {s o f t p l u s} (\zeta) & \text {i f} \zeta <   \tau / b, \end{array} \right.
$$

where  $\zeta = a_{1} - a_{2}$ . It is important to note that such a technique cannot be performed for smoothing using Logexpsum or Boltzmann-style operators and is exclusively applicable on STL2LB. By selecting  $\tau$  large enough, we can maintain the differentiability of operators, at least to the accuracy level of existing computation tools. To avoid the shortcomings of Logexpsum and Boltzmann-style approximations, we use softplus (with the above modifications) and the swish function as activations.

Lemma 1. For any formula  $\varphi$  belonging to STL in positive normal form, and  $b > 0$ , for a given trajectory  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0} = \mathbf{s}_0, \mathbf{s}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{s}_K$ , if STL2LB( $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}$ ;  $b > 0$ ), then  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0} \models \varphi$ , where STL2LB is a computation graph for STL robustness degree but with the modified softplus activation instead of min and the modified swish activation instead of max.

See Appendix J for proof. The main contributions of STL2LB comparing to the existing smooth robustness formula (Gilpin et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2017) can be summarized as follows:

- Example 1 shows that STL2LB provides convenience for computation.  
- Lemma 1 indicates that, like (Gilpin et al., 2020), it is also a guaranteed smooth lower-bound for robustness function, thus, can be considered as a control barrier function.

# 3.2 TRAINING WITH STL2LB

In order to train the controller for all initial states,  $\mathbf{s}_0\in \mathcal{I}$  we solve the following optimization problem:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \theta^ {*} = \underset {\theta} {\arg \max} \left(\mathbb {E} _ {\mathbf {s} _ {0} \sim \mathcal {I}} \left[ \rho (\varphi , \sigma_ {\mathbf {s} _ {0}} ^ {\theta}, 0) \right]\right), \\ \mathbf {s}. \mathbf {t}. \sigma_ {\mathbf {s} _ {0}} ^ {\theta} (k + 1) = \\ \mathbf {f} \left(\sigma_ {\mathbf {s} _ {0}} ^ {\theta} (k), \pi_ {\theta} \left(\sigma_ {\mathbf {s} _ {0}} ^ {\theta} (k), k\right)\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

that aims to increase the expectation of the robustness for initial states uniformly sampled from the set of initial states. Solving

# Algorithm 1: Neurosymbolic policy learning

1 Input:  $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}$ ,  $\theta^0$ ,  $b$ ,  $\varphi$ ,  $\bar{\rho}$  
$j\gets 0$

3 while  $\left(\min_{\mathbf{s}_0\in \widehat{\mathcal{I}}}\left(\rho (\varphi ,\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^{\theta j},0)\right) <   \bar{\rho}\right)$  do

4  $\mathbf{s}_0\gets$  Sample from  $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}$  5  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s_0}}^{\theta^j}\gets$  Simulate using policy  $\pi_{\theta^j}$  
6  $d\gets \nabla_{\theta}\mathsf{STL2LB}(\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_o}^{\theta j})$  using  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_o}^{\theta j}$  
7  $\theta^{j + 1}\gets \theta^j +\mathsf{Adam}(d)$  
8  $j\gets j + 1$

this optimization problem is equivalent to training the NN controller using a gradient-based algorithm (shown in Alg. 1). However we terminate the algorithm once the robustness is above a pre-specified lower threshold  $\bar{\rho}$ . We also generate a population of samples from the set of initial states of the system, i.e.  $\mathcal{I}$ , for training purposes and denote this set by  $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}$ .

# 3.3 EXTENSION TO LONG HORIZON TEMPORAL TASKS & HIGHER DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS

When dealing with long time-horizon trajectories or high dimensional models, considering the entire trajectory to compute  $\nabla_{\theta}\mathsf{STL2LB}(\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^{\theta^j})$  in Alg. 1, becomes computationally impractical as it either approaches zero (vanishes) or diverges (explodes) due to the high number of steps in the trajectory  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}$ . To alleviate this, inspired by the well-known idea of Drop-out (Srivastava et al., 2014) for backpropagation, we propose a sampling-based gradient approximation technique that prevents the gradient to explode/vanish and is also known to provide a robust training process. The basic idea in sampling-based technique is to only select certain time-points in the trajectory for gradient computation, while using a fixed older control policy at the non-selected points. In order to select time points, a naive strategy is to choose time-points randomly. However, in our preliminary results, exploiting the structure of the given STL formula – specifically identifying and using critical predicates – gives superior results compared to random sampling.

Definition 1 (Critical Predicate). As the robustness degree of STL is an expression consisting of min and max of robustness values of predicates at different times, the robustness degree is consistently equivalent to the robustness of one of the predicates  $h(\cdot)$  at a specific time. This specific predicate  $h^*$  is called the critical predicate, and this specific time  $k^*$  is called the critical time.

A difficulty in using critical predicates is that a change in controller parameter values may change the system trajectory, which may in turn change the predicate that is critical for its robustness value. Specifically, if the critical predicate in one gradient step is different from the critical predicate in the subsequent gradient step, our gradient ascent strategy fails to augment the robustness value, since it only results in the elevation of that specific critical predicate's value. The incorrect gradient generated in this gradient step can lead to failure in the training process, as it may abruptly reduce the robustness

value drastically.

Given a predefined specification  $\varphi$ , Fig. 1 shows the non-differentiable points in robustness as a function of control parameters, with each smooth segment corresponding to a distinct critical predicate. In order to optimize robustness within these smooth partitions, stochastic optimizers like Adam can be employed effectively. However, it is essential to note that the Adam optimizer's applicability is confined to differentiable points. To overcome this challenge, we employ a technique which utilizes STL2LB to re-smooth the problem at the non-differentiable local maxima. However, it is practically impossible to accurately detect the non-differentiable local maxima, thus we take a more conservative approach and shift the training approach to uti

Figure 1: Shows a demonstration for the functionality of non-differentiable robustness function with respect to the control parameters. Assuming a fixed initial state, every control parameter is corresponding to a simulated trajectory, and that trajectory represents a robustness value. This robustness value is equal to the quantitative semantics for the critical predicate. In every single smooth part of this plot, the control parameters are offering a unique critical predicate.

lize STL2LB at every gradient step where the critical predicate technique is unable to improve the robustness. The rest of this section presents a detailed explanation for each module in our training algorithm, and Alg. 2 encapsulates these modules within a unified training process. In this algorithm, we use  $\rho^{\varphi}(\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta)$  as shorthand for the robustness degree of  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^\theta$  w.r.t.  $\varphi$  at time 0. A detailed explanation for Alg. 2 is also provided in Appendix A.

Sampling-based gradient approximation technique. This technique is based on sampling across recurrent units and is originally inspired by the popular idea of Drop-out proposed in (Srivastava et al., 2014). Considering the NN controllers rolled out over the trajectory, the idea of Drop-out suggests removing the randomly selected nodes from a randomly selected NN controller over the trajectory. This requires the node to be absent in both forward-pass and backward-pass in backpropagation algorithm. However, our primary goal is to alleviate the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients. Thus, we propose to sample random time steps and select all of its controller nodes to apply Dropout. However, for long trajectories we need to drop out a large portion of time steps that result in inaccurate approximation, thus we compensate for this by repeating this process and computing for accumulative gradients (See parameters  $N_{1}, N_{2}$  in Alg. 2). Restriction of Drop-out to sample time steps results in less number of self multiplication of weights and therefore alleviates the problem of

vanishing/exploding gradient. However, this may result in disconnection between the trajectory states and thus we need to apply modifications to this strategy. To that end, we drop out the selected nodes but we also replace that group of selected nodes (controller unit) with its evaluation in forward pass. This strategy motivates us to define the sampled trajectory as proposed in definition 2.

Definition 2 (Sampled Trajectory). Consider the set of time steps  $\mathcal{T} = \{0, t_1, t_2, \dots, t_N\}$  sampled from the horizon  $\mathcal{K} = \{0, 1, 2, \dots, K\}$ , and the control parameters  $\theta^j$  in the gradient step  $j$ . The sampled trajectory  $\tilde{\sigma}_{\mathbf{s}_0,\mathcal{T}}^{\theta^j}$  is a subset of trajectory states  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^{\theta^j}$ , where  $\tilde{\sigma}_{\mathbf{s}_0,\mathcal{T}}^{\theta^j}(0) = \mathbf{s}_0$  and

$$
\forall i \in \{0, 1, \dots , N \}: \tilde {\sigma} _ {{\bf s} _ {0}, \mathcal {T}} ^ {\theta^ {j}} (i + 1) = {\bf f} _ {i} ^ {j} (\tilde {\sigma} _ {{\bf s} _ {0}, \mathcal {T}} ^ {\theta} (i), \pi_ {\theta^ {j}} (\tilde {\sigma} _ {{\bf s} _ {0}, \mathcal {T}} ^ {\theta^ {j}} (i), t _ {i})).
$$

Given the pre-computed constants  $\{\mathbf{a}_{1 + t_i},\mathbf{a}_{2 + t_i},\dots \mathbf{a}_{t_{i + 1} - 1}\}$  using  $\theta^j$  in the gradient step  $j$ , the dynamics model  $\mathbf{f}_i^j$  is defined as:  $\mathbf{f}_i^j (\mathbf{s},\mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{f}(\cdot \cdot \cdot (\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{a}),\mathbf{a}_{1 + t_i}),\mathbf{a}_{2 + t_i}),\dots ,\mathbf{a}_{t_{i + 1} - 1})$

Figure 2 in Appendix A makes this definition more clear through visualization. This definition applies the idea of Dropout that is also equipped with our modification to replace the set of selected nodes on a randomly selected time step with its pre-computed output in the forward pass for original trajectory. This set of nodes are indeed a controller unit on the sampled time step. However our contribution from the idea of sampled trajectory are listed as follows:

1. to apply the idea of Drop-out on control synthesis over extended trajectories which alleviates for the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients.  
2. to restrict the sampling process to timesteps instead of a random node selection on trajectory.  
3. to assure that the critical time is included in the set of sampled time steps.

In this work we denote the gradient of original trajectory with 'original gradient' and the approximate gradient from our sampling technique as 'robust gradient'. In the backpropagation algorithm at a given gradient step  $j$  with control parameter,  $\theta^j$  we wish to compute the robust gradient  $\partial \mathcal{J} / \partial \theta^j$ . To that end, we utilize  $\theta^j$  to simulate the trajectory  $\{\mathbf{s}_0,\mathbf{s}_1,\dots,\mathbf{s}_K\}$  and control sequence  $\{\mathbf{a}_0,\mathbf{a}_1,\dots,\mathbf{a}_{K - 1}\}$ . We then generate a set of random selections for the sampled times  $\mathcal{T}^q,q\in [M]$  and define the sampled trajectories,  $\tilde{\sigma}_{\mathbf{s}_0,\mathcal{T}^q}^{\theta^j}$  with the specified interrelation proposed in the definition 2. In the next gradient step,

$j + 1$  we again generate a new set of sampled times and repeat the process.

Way Point Function. The way point function,  $\mathcal{J}^{wp}(\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^{\theta})$ , is established as a reward-based function designed to offer incentives to the optimizer to guide the trajectory toward a pre-defined path.

Safe re-smoothing. As discussed before, in the event that the optimization process steers the control parameters towards non-differentiable local maxima, there may be a drastic reduction in the value of the robustness function. In this case, we replace the objective function with  $\mathcal{J}(\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^{\theta^j}) =$  STL2LB(  $\sigma_{\mathbf{s}_0}^{\theta^j};b)$  . This is because, STL2LB is a smooth version of robustness over the trajectory, in addition, it is a guaranteed lower bound for robustness and its distance to robustness can also be controlled with  $b$  . Thus, its inclusion makes the re-smoothing process safe against a potential drastic drop in robustness value.

In case the objective function  $\mathcal{J}$  is the value of critical predicate, it is only a function of the trajectory state  $\mathbf{s}_{k^*}$  and we sample the time steps as,  $\mathcal{T} = \{0,t_1,t_2,\dots ,t_N\}$ ,  $t_N = k^*$ . The original gradient is  $\partial \mathcal{J} / \partial \theta = (\partial \mathcal{J} / \partial \mathbf{s}_{k^*})(\partial \mathbf{s}_{k^*} / \partial \theta)$  but based on our sampling technique inspired with Drop-out, the robust gradient will be defined as,  $\partial \mathcal{J} / \partial \theta = (\partial \mathcal{J} / \partial \mathbf{s}_{k^*})(\partial \tilde{\sigma}_{\mathbf{s}_0,\mathcal{T}}^\theta (N) / \partial \theta)$  where unlike  $\partial \mathbf{s}_{k^*} / \partial \theta$  that is prone to vanish/explode problem, the new term  $\partial \tilde{\sigma}_{\mathbf{s}_0,\mathcal{T}}^\theta (N) / \partial \theta$  can be computed efficiently<sup>6</sup>.

In case the objective function is way-point or STL2LB, that is a function of all the trajectory states, we consequently segment the trajectory into  $M$  different partitions, by random time sampling as,

$$
\mathcal {T} ^ {q} = \left\{0, t _ {1} ^ {q}, t _ {2} ^ {q}, \dots , t _ {N} ^ {q} \right\}, q \in [ M ], (\forall q _ {1}, q _ {2} \in [ M ]: \mathcal {T} ^ {q _ {1}} \cap \mathcal {T} ^ {q _ {2}} = \{0 \}) \wedge (\mathcal {K} = \bigcup_ {q = 1} ^ {M} \mathcal {T} ^ {q}), \tag {6}
$$

with sub-trajectories generated by  $\mathcal{T}^q, q \in [M]$  denoted as  $X^q = \left\{\mathbf{s}_0, \mathbf{s}_{t_1^q}, \dots, \mathbf{s}_{t_N^q}\right\}$ . We know the original gradient in this case is  $\partial \mathcal{J} / \partial \theta = \sum_{q=1}^{M} (\partial \mathcal{J} / \partial X^q) (\partial X^q / \partial \theta)$ . However in our training process to compute the robust gradient, the gradient matrix  $\partial X^q / \partial \theta$  is supposed to be replaced with  $\partial \tilde{\sigma}_{\mathbf{s}_0, \mathcal{T}^q}^\theta / \partial \theta$ . Unlike the inefficient gradient matrix  $\partial X^q / \partial \theta$  that is prone to vanish/explode problem, the gradient matrix  $\partial \tilde{\sigma}_{\mathbf{s}_0, \mathcal{T}^q}^\theta / \partial \theta$  can be computed efficiently.

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

In this section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method. We implemented all experiments in MATLAB<sup>7</sup>. We give the details of our experimental setup in the Appendix. We evaluate on 5 environments (details given in the Appendix) (a) a 3 dimensional simple car, (b) a 6 dimensional drone, (c) a 6 dimensional drone combined with a moving frame with a task requiring a long path plan, (d) a multi-agent system of 10 connected Dubins car, and (e) a 12 dimensional quad-rotor.

Evaluation metric. To evaluate the performance of our method, we first compare the results of Alg. 1 with the examples proposed in (Yaghoubi & Fainekos, 2019) for environments (a) and (b), and compare the runtimes. As the dimension of system increases, it becomes more challenging to avoid the training procedure from converging to local optima. Increasing the horizon of temporal task causes the gradients to become non-informative, as they potentially vanish or explode. Therefore, environments (c), (d) and (e) are solved with Alg. 2. We also show that Alg. 1 is unable to finish the computation for long horizon experiments within a reasonable number of iterations or runtime.

Comparison. Application of Alg. 1 on the environments (a) and (b), shows noticeable improvement, w.r.t. the previous work in (Yaghoubi & Fainekos, 2019). In these examples, we started from a random initial guess for NN parameters and computed the solution within  $\approx 6$  minutes. However the reported runtime in (Yaghoubi & Fainekos, 2019) is noticeably higher than ours. Appendix L shows a comparison between the performance of STL2LB and the previous works (Pant et al., 2017; Gilpin et al., 2020). This comparison emphasizes on the computational problem proposed in Example 1.

Main results. We test the performance of our proposed sampling-based algorithm in highly nonlinear and high dimensional environments over long and also complex temporal tasks (details in the appendix). Table 2 reports the results of these experiments.

To evaluate the contribution of Alg. 2 we perform an ablation study on a simple Dubin's car environment. We assume an  $1m \times 1m$  area for execution, and specify that the car moves in this area within  $K = 10$  time steps ( $\delta t = 0.1$ ) while avoiding an obstacle presented in this area (Figure 11 is a scaled ( $\times 100$ ) version of this area). We evaluate the same case study, but with task horizons ranging from 10 to 1000 time steps. With increasing number of time-steps, we also need to magnify the size of the environment to maintain task difficulty. The ablation study involves solving each of these problems: (1) with the vanilla version of Alg. 1 with no sampling-based robust gradient computation (2) Alg. 1 where sampling-based robust gradient approach is performed using random times within the trajectory, and (3) Alg. 2 that combines gradient-based sampling based on critical predicates, safe re-smoothing, and waypoint functions. We summarize the results in Table 1. We can see that the inclusion of time sampling decreases the runtime for training process. We also observe that for relatively small horizons  $K = 10,50$ , Alg. 1 performs slightly better than Alg. 2 in terms of runtime but for  $K = 100,500,1000$  Alg. 2 is much more efficient. In the table, an entry "NF" indicates when the algorithm is unable to solve the problem within 8000 gradient steps. In Alg. 1, as the dimension of STL2LB grows with the length of the horizon and dimension of the system, we see it struggle with the more complex case studies.

Table 2 highlights the versatility of our technique to handle various case studies with number of dimensions as high as 20, and time horizons in thousands of steps. We also use a diverse set of temporal task objectives that include nested temporal operators, and those involving trajectories from two independently moving objects (Drone & Moving Frame case study). The results were produced using Alg. 2.

# 5 CONCLUSION

We introduce STL2LB, a smooth computation graph that lower bounds the robustness degree of an STL specification. We present a neurosymbolic algorithm that uses informative gradients for the design of NN controllers to satisfy STL specifications. We also propose a sampling-based technique to compute robust gradient that does not vanish/explode for long-horizon STL formulas, and provide some strategies to overcome challenges posed by non-differentiable local maxima. We show the efficacy of our training algorithm on a variety of different case studies and present an ablation study that validates the significance of our proposed heuristics.

# 6 REPRODUCIBILITY
