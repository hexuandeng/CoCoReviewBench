# Abstract

Existing multi-modal 3D object detectors typically consider a unilateral association strategy with a biased inclination on 3D LiDAR point clouds whilst treating the 2D multi-camera images as an auxiliary information source. As a result, those useful high-resolution information unique with the images is rigidly thrown away in modality association. In essence, the intrinsic complementary nature between the two modalities is fully overlooked by prior arts. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D object detection architecture, dubbed as DeepInteraction, characterized by bilateral interaction and association throughout both representation encoding and decoding, in order to maximally exploit the inter-modal complementary property. Extensive experiments verify the accuracy superiority of DeepInteraction over the state-of-the-art methods by large margin on the large scale nuScenes benchmark.

As highlighted in red boxes, often one modality (either the point clouds or image) is favored over the other depending on the specific situations. Neither modality is always preferred, which means the two modalities are strongly complementary.

3D object detection is critical for autonomous driving by localizing and recognizing decision-sensitive objects in the 3D space. For reliable object detection, LiDAR and camera sensors have been systematically deployed to provide low-resolution point clouds with depth information and high-resolution visual images, respectively. The two modalities exhibit naturally strong complementary effects due to such different perception characteristics. However, it is non-trivial to associate and jointly exploit both modalities due to the intrinsic sensor misalignment challenge [38]. As highlighted in the red boxes of Figure 1, one modality would be favored over the other depending on which unconstrained driving conditions. Neither modality is always preferred throughout, which means the two modalities are strongly complementary. As a specific example, due to the low-resolution nature with LiDAR sensor, small objects will be significantly under-represented with only one point

or very few points; In this case, the coupled image will be useful by offering more visual appearance information thanks to its high-resolution property.

Existing top-performing multi-modal 3D object detection methods fall into two categories. The first category of methods (e.g., PointPainting [29] and PointAugmentation [30]) decorate the LiDAR points at the input level (Figure 2(a)). Specifically, the image features are used to enrich the low-resolution point cloud information (e.g., shape and depth). Such decorated point clouds are limited in improving the performance due to the big inter-modality discrepancy. To address this issue, the second category of methods (e.g., TransFusion [1]) take a feature-level fusion paradigm (Figure 2(b)). Technically, this strategy maximizes the correlation of LiDAR and camera data in the representation space. Commonly, both paradigms treat the coupled images as an auxiliary modality with a biased inclination on the LiDAR modality. As a consequence, those useful information unique with the 2D image data is simply thrown away during the unilateral fusion step. That being said, the intrinsic complementary property of the two modalities as clearly exhibited in the raw data is not properly and fully leveraged.

To overcome the aforementioned architectural limitations of existing solutions, in this work we introduce a novel multi-modal 3D object detection architecture capable of conducting bilateral interaction between 3D point clouds and multi-camera visual images (Figure 1), dubbed as DeepInteraction. Specifically, the whole pipeline of DeepInteraction has three stages: (1) In the feature extraction stage, 3D point clouds and 2D multi-view images are encoded into intermediate representations using two modality-specific encoders, respectively; (2) In the encoding stage, the two representations intensively are interacted and fused with each other with a multi-modal encoder to build more expressive embedding; (3) In the decoding stage, these embeddings are further alternatively aggregated with a multi-modal dynamic decoder for generating predictions. In design, the two modalities are associated and interacted in both directions so that modality-specific strengths can be fully leveraged for maximally capitalizing their complementary effects.

The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (i) With in-depth assessment into the model design, we reveal an architectural limitation of existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods that multi-camera 2D images with fine visual appearance information is only exploited unilaterally as an auxiliary modality. This ends up with insufficient exploitation of the multi-modality perception data coming with intrinsically strong complementary nature. (ii) To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel DeepInteraction architecture based on bilateral interaction and association across modalities, through both representation encoding and decoding in both directions. (iii) Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that our DeepInteraction yields new state of the art for multi-modality 3D object detection, often with a large margin over the alternatives.

3D object detection with single modality Automated driving vehicles are generally equipped with both LiDAR and multiple surround-view cameras. Many previous methods preform 3D object

detection by exploiting data captured from only a single form of sensors. For camera-based 3D object detection, since depth information is not directly accessible from RGB images, some previous works [17, 31, 27] lift 2D features into a 3D space by conducting depth estimation, followed by performing object detection in the 3D space. Another line of works [32, 23, 21] resort to the detection Transformer [5] architecture. They leverage 3D object queries and 3D-2D correspondence to incorporate 3D computation into the detection pipelines. Despite the rapid progress of camera-based approaches, the state-of-the-art of 3D object detection is still dominated by LiDAR-based methods. Most of LiDAR-based detectors quantify point clouds into regular grid structures such as voxels [39, 35], pillars [20] or range images [2, 15, 7] before processing them. Due to the sampling characteristics of LiDAR, these grids are naturally sparse and hence fit the Transformer design. So, a number of approaches [24, 14] have applied the Transformer for point cloud feature extraction. Differently, several methods use the Transformer decoder or its variants as their detection head [1, 33]. In contrast, we present an encoder-decoder architecture as an unified framework for both feature interaction and prediction.

Multi-modality fusion for 3D object detection Leveraging the perception data from both camera and LiDAR sensors typically leads to improved performance, which hence emerges as a promising direction. Existing 3D detection methods typically perform multi-modal association/fusion at one of the three points: raw input, intermediate feature, and object proposal. For example, PointPainting [29] is the pioneering input fusion method [30, 18, 12]. The main idea is to decorate the 3D point clouds with the category scores or semantic features from the 2D instance segmentation network. Whilst 4D-Net [25] placed the fusion module in the point cloud feature extractor for allowing the point cloud features to dynamically attend to the image features. The proposal based fusion methods [19, 8] keep the feature extraction of two modalities independently and aggregate multi-modal features via proposals or queries at the detection head. The first two categories of methods take a unilateral fusion strategy with bias to 3D LiDAR modality due to the superiority of point clouds in distance and spatial perception. Instead, the last category fully ignores the intrinsic association between the two modalities in representation. As a result, all these previous methods fail to fully exploit both modalities with strong complementary nature. In this work, we address this limitation with all previous solutions by developing a bilateral interaction and association based architecture for exploring the inter-modal complementary effect.

# 3 DeepInteraction

We adopt DETR [6] as the backbone architecture due to no need of hand-crafted components like anchor generation and non-maximum suppression. At the presence of multi-modal inputs, extending the standard DETR, originally designed for single-modal 2D object detection, becomes non-trivial. This is primarily due to an extra challenge of reliably associating the 3D LiDAR points and 2D image pixels without perfect correspondence. We hence introduce a novel bilateral association framework (DeepInteraction) for multi-modal 3D object detection, characterized by deep interaction between 3D point clouds and 2D multi-camera images. In contrast to all prior arts, we treat the 3D LiDAR and 2D camera modalities equally and conduct multi-modal interaction through both representation encoding and decoding. An overview of our DeepInteraction is shown in Figure 3(a).

In the following, we will first provide the preliminary of 3D object detection with Transformers in Section 3.1. We then describe how to perform multi-modal interaction in both the encoder (Section 3.2) and decoder (Section 3.3).

# 3.1 Preliminary: 3D object detection with Transformers

Given multi-modal input including 3D LiDAR point clouds  $\boldsymbol{x}_p$  and surrounding 2D RGB images  $\boldsymbol{x}_c$ , the model need to predict a set of 3D bounding boxes along with category labels  $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}$ . We start with the context representation extraction per modality:  $\boldsymbol{h}_p = f_{\psi_p}(\boldsymbol{x}_p)$  for 3D point cloud by a 3D backbone and  $\boldsymbol{h}_c = f_{\psi_c}(\boldsymbol{x}_c)$  for 2D image by a 2D backbone. Adopting the original structure

Figure 3: Overview of DeepInteraction for LiDAR-camera sensors based 3D object detection.  
(c) multi-modal decoder

of the Transformer, our model consists of two modules: (i) the multi-modal encoder, and (ii) the multi-modal decoder. Taking the context representations  $\pmb{h}_p$  and  $\pmb{h}_c$  as input, the encoder outputs an enhanced multi-modal embeddings:

$$
\boldsymbol {h} = f _ {\phi} \left(\mathcal {A} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {p}, \boldsymbol {h} _ {c}\right)\right), \tag {1}
$$

where  $\mathcal{A}(\cdot)$  is an association function that combines the heterogeneous inputs from two modalities. This  $\mathcal{A}(\cdot)$  can be instantiated as addition, concatenation, or a learnable module such as the multi-head cross-attention as in Transfusion [1]. The decoder needs to make the final predictions by taking the multi-modal representations  $h$  as input:

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {y}} = f _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {h}). \tag {2}
$$

Following DETR, the optimal bipartite matching is computed for matching the set of predictions  $\hat{\pmb{y}}$  with the ground-truth  $\pmb{y}$  annotations. During optimization, the model is trained to minimize the matching cost.

Remarks As described above, the multi-modal association in Transfusion [1] by design is unilateral, conducted before the encoder input (Eq. 1). Thus, the LiDAR-camera data is not fully interacted and exploited for final prediction (Eq. 2). Instead of employing a stand-alone and unilateral association, we formulate  $\mathcal{A}(\cdot)$  within both encoder and decoder, so that the two modalities can interact deeply for maximally capitalizing their complementary nature.

# 3.2 Multi-modal interaction in encoding

Multi-modal bilateral mapping To enable multi-modal interaction in the encoder, we first need to build the correspondence relationship between the context representations  $\pmb{h}_p$  and  $\pmb{h}_c$ . To that end, we build a bilateral mapping between the 3D LiDAR point cloud and 2D camera images:  $\mathcal{M}_{p\rightarrow c}$  and  $\mathcal{M}_{c\rightarrow p}$ , to locate and sample the spatially corresponding features between the two modalities.

For the 3D LiDAR to 2D camera mapping  $\mathcal{M}_{p\rightarrow c}$  (Figure 4(a)), we first obtain the point coordinates  $\{(x,y,z)\}$  of a pillar. Then, we project the 3D locations into a set of pixel coordinates  $\{(i,j)\}$  on the corresponding image views, according to the extrinsic and intrinsic camera matrices. Also, the bilinear interpolation is used to sample 2D image features  $\{h_c(x,y,z)\}$  located at  $\{(i,j)\}$  for the pillar from multi-view image context representations  $h_c$ .

For the 2D camera to 3D LiDAR mapping  $\mathcal{M}_{c\to p}$  (Figure 4(b)), we project each point  $(x,y,z)$  on 3D point cloud to the spatially corresponding image location  $(i,j)$  to obtain the sparse depth maps  $d_{sparse}$ . Then, we complete sparse depth maps  $d_{sparse}$  into dense depth map  $d_{dense}$  and project the depth to 3D coordinates  $(x,y,z)$ , which is used to locate a BEV feature pillar  $h_p(i,j)$  at the location of  $(x,y,z)$  from  $h_p$  for the 2D image location  $(i,j)$ . All located BEV feature pillars are reorganized into a 2D shape.

Multi-modal feature interactions We aim to construct multilateral interaction, enabling information to flow in different modality. We introduce inner-modal interaction (i.e.,  $f_{\phi_{p \to p}}$  and  $f_{\phi_{c \to c}}$ ) to explore the intrinsic connections of the inner-modal modalities themselves. Besides, to associate the spatial and semantic information on the same object, we also design the cross-modal interaction (i.e.,  $f_{\phi_{c \to p}}$  represents the interaction from image to point clouds and  $f_{\phi_{p \to c}}$  vice versa). In the following, we detail the four multi-modal feature interactions (Figure 3(b)).

For all types of interaction module, we use local attention [26] to capture the local correlation. This can be formulated analogously as:

$$
\boldsymbol {v} ^ {\prime} = \sum_ {\boldsymbol {k}, \boldsymbol {v} \in \mathcal {N} _ {q}} \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\frac {\boldsymbol {q} \boldsymbol {k}}{\sqrt {d _ {k}}}\right) \boldsymbol {v}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $\mathbf{q}$  is the query feature and  $\mathcal{N}_q$  denotes a group of features in the spatial neighborhood of  $\mathbf{q}$ .

The inner-modal interaction of point clouds  $(\pmb{h}_p^{p\rightarrow p} = f_{\phi_{p\rightarrow p}}(\pmb {h}_p))$  and images  $(\pmb{h}_c^{c\rightarrow c} = f_{\phi_{c\rightarrow c}}(\pmb {h}_c))$  allow interaction within the neighboring feature pixels using Eq. 3. In this case, we define  $\mathcal{N}_q$  as the inner-modal features in 2D spatial  $k\times k$  neighborhood of query feature pixel, where  $k = 9$ . We transform each pixel of input feature into  $\pmb{q}$ , and transform  $\mathcal{N}_q$  into  $\pmb{k}$  and  $\pmb{v}$ . In doing so, the final features that are weighted by the attention map (i.e.,  $\pmb{h}_p^{p\rightarrow p}$  and  $\pmb{h}_c^{c\rightarrow c}$ ) are more likely to focus on locally important information.

Cross-modal interactions take the same spirit of locality, with a slight modification on the definition of  $\mathcal{N}_q$  in Eq. 3.

For the interaction from point clouds to images  $(\pmb{h}_c^{p\rightarrow c} = f_{\phi_{p\rightarrow c}}(\pmb{h}_p,\pmb{h}_c))$ , the LiDAR BEV feature map  $\pmb{h}_{p}$  is first reorganized into the same form with multi-view image feature maps  $\pmb{h}_{c}$  via 3D LiDAR to 2D camera mapping  $\mathcal{M}_{p\rightarrow c}$ . Then, for each query  $\pmb{q} = \pmb{h}_c[i,j]$  in Eq. 3, the neighborhood  $\mathcal{N}_q$  is a set of feature pixels within a square patch centered around  $(i,j)$  on reorganized LiDAR BEV feature map, with spatial extent  $k = 9$ .

On the contrary, the interaction from images to point clouds  $(\pmb{h}_p^{c\rightarrow p} = f_{\phi_c\rightarrow p}(\pmb{h}_c,\pmb{h}_p))$  is proposed to spread visual signals from multi-view image feature maps  $\pmb{h}_c$  to LiDAR BEV feature map  $\pmb{h}_p$ . Specifically, given  $\pmb{q} = \pmb{h}_p[i,j]$  as query, its neighborhood  $\mathcal{N}_q$  is defined as a group of image features sampled by  $\mathcal{M}_{c\rightarrow p}$ .

In the above processes, four interacted multi-modal feature maps (i.e.,  $h_p^{p\rightarrow p}$ ,  $h_c^{c\rightarrow c}$ ,  $h_p^{c\rightarrow p}$ , and  $h_c^{p\rightarrow c}$ ) are generated by multi-modal feature interactions described above respectively. Then, a pair of MLP layers (denoted as  $\mathrm{MLP}(\cdot)$  in Eq. 4,5) are conducted in succession to fuse the augmented features before and after interactions into the final enriched representation (Figure 3(b)). The computation of each encoder layer can be formulated as:

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {p} ^ {\prime} = \operatorname {M L P} \left(\operatorname {M L P} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {p} ^ {p \rightarrow p}, \boldsymbol {h} _ {p} ^ {c \rightarrow p}\right), \boldsymbol {h} _ {p}\right), \tag {4}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {c} ^ {\prime} = \operatorname {M L P} \left(\operatorname {M L P} \left(\boldsymbol {h} _ {c} ^ {c \rightarrow c}, \boldsymbol {h} _ {c} ^ {p \rightarrow c}\right), \boldsymbol {h} _ {c}\right). \tag {5}
$$

Furthermore, we can construct more expressive representations by stacking more encoder layers, where each subsequent layer takes the multi-modal enriched representations  $h_p'$  and  $h_c'$  from the previous layer as input.

Figure 5: The illustration of the multi-modal decoder interaction layer.

# 3.3 Multi-modal interaction in decoding

After obtaining the interacted representations  $h_p'$  and  $h_c'$  for LiDAR and camera, we further consider to maximize the complementary effect in the decoder. As single-modal representations alone may not cover enough useful information for making robust predictions. Therefore, we propose a multi-modal alternate query refinement strategy to perform multi-modal interaction in the decoder.

Multi-modal alternate query refinement As illustrated in Figure 3(c), the proposed multi-modal decoder contains  $N$  alternate decoder layers which iteratively refine the bounding box predictions by aggregating features from two modalities. Specifically, we follow Transfusion [1] to obtain the initial queries  $\pmb{q}$  of decoder from combining LiDAR interacted features  $\pmb{h}_{p}^{\prime}$  and original LiDAR context features  $\pmb{h}_{p}$  to speed up convergence. To enable more flexible interaction between modalities, we employ the dynamic instance interaction (Dync.) head [28] as the decoder interaction layer, as shown in Figure 5, in which we compute the predictions by alternately taking the interacted representations  $\pmb{h}_{p}^{\prime}$  and  $\pmb{h}_{c}^{\prime}$  of two modalities as input. In doing so, the decoder queries  $\pmb{q}$  are refined iteratively by fully exploiting both LiDAR and camera information.

# 3.4 Optimization

During training, we utilize a set-to-set loss [6] between predicted and ground-truth objects:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {h u n g a r i a n}} (\boldsymbol {y}, \hat {\boldsymbol {y}}) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \left(\mathcal {L} _ {\text {c l s}} \left(\boldsymbol {c} _ {i}, \hat {\boldsymbol {c}} _ {\sigma (i)}\right) + \mathbb {1} _ {\{\boldsymbol {c} _ {i} \neq \emptyset \}} \mathcal {L} _ {\text {r e g}} \left(\boldsymbol {b} _ {i}, \hat {\boldsymbol {b}} _ {\sigma (i)}\right)\right), \tag {6}
$$

where  $\sigma(\cdot)$  denotes the optimal bipartite matching between  $y$  and  $\hat{y}$  found by Hungarian algorithm,  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{cls}}$  is the focal loss for classification, and  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{reg}}$  is the  $\ell_1$  loss for bounding box regression. The matching cost  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{match}}$  used for computing optimal assignment  $\sigma(\cdot)$  is the weighted sum of  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{cls}}$ ,  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{reg}}$  and the negative 3D IoU. We also compute the auxiliary loss with the same form as Eq. 6 for the predictions of each layer to stabilize convergence. In addition, we provide direct supervision for heatmap prediction in query initialization by adding an extra Gaussian Focal Loss [36].

# 4 Experiments

# 4.1 Experimental setup

Dataset We evaluate our approach on the nuScenes dataset [3]. It provides 32-beam point clouds from LiDAR and images with resolution of  $1600 \times 900$  from 6 surrounding cameras. The total of 1000 scenes, where each sequence is roughly 20 seconds long and annotated every 0.5 second, is officially split into train/val/test set with 700/150/150 scenes. For the 3D object detection task, 1.4M objects in scenes are annotated with 3D bounding boxes and classified into 10 categories: car, truck, bus, trailer, construction vehicle, pedestrian, motorcycle, bicycle, barrier, and traffic cone. We follow the common practice to transform points from the past 9 sweeps to the current frame.

Metric Mean average precision (mAP) [13] and nuScenes detection score (NDS) [3] are used as the evaluation metric of 3D detection performance. The final mAP is computed by averaging over

# 4.2 Implementation details

Our implementation is based on the public code base mmdetection3d [11]. For image branch, we initialize our backbone and FPN [22] from the instance segmentation model Cascade Mask R-CNN [4] with resnet-50 [16] pretrained on nuImage [3]. To save the computation cost, we rescale the input image to 1/2 of its original size before feeding into the network, and freeze the weights of image branch during training. The voxel size is set to  $(0.075m, 0.075m, 0.2m)$ , and the detection range is set to  $[-54m, 54m]$  for  $X$  and  $Y$  axis and  $[-5m, 3m]$  for  $Z$  axis.

For data augmentation, we follow TransFusion [1] and adopt random rotation with a range of  $r \in [-\pi /4,\pi /4]$ , random scaling with a factor of  $r \in [0.9,1.1]$ , random translation with standard deviation 0.5 in three axis, and random horizontal flipping. We also use the class-balanced resampling in CBGS [40] to balance the class distribution for nuScenes. We use TransFusion-L [1] as our LiDAR-only baseline. For training schedule, we use Adam optimizer with one-cycle learning rate policy, with max learning rate  $1 \times 10^{-3}$ , weight decay 0.01 and momentum 0.85 to 0.95, following CBGS [40]. Our LiDAR-only baseline is trained for 20 epochs and LiDAR-camera fusion for 6 epochs with batch size of 16 using 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs.

# 4.3 Comparison to the state of the art

We compare with state-of-the-art alternatives on the nuScenes test set. We test single model with and without test-time augmentation respectively, as well as model ensemble. Following the common practice [36] for model ensemble we merge the results from multiple models with voxel size of  $0.05\mathrm{m}$ ,  $0.075\mathrm{m}$ ,  $0.1\mathrm{m}$ ,  $0.125\mathrm{m}$  and  $0.15\mathrm{m}$ . As shown in Table 1, our model achieves  $70.8\%$  mAP and  $73.4\%$  NDS on the nuScenes test set without bells and whistles, outperforming alternative Transfusion [1] by  $1.9\%$  mAP and  $1.7\%$  NDS. Our model beats the closest rival Focals Conv-F [9] by a considerable margin under the same configuration, which clearly verifies the effectiveness of our multi-modal interaction approach. To the best of our knowledge, DeepInteraction surpasses all the published LiDAR-camera methods on the nuScenes 3D object detection test set leaderboard.

# 4.4 Ablation studies

3D Backbone As shown in Table 3e, we examine our framework's compatibility with different 3D backbones: PointPillars [20] and VoxelNet [39]. For PointPillars backbone, we set the voxel size to  $(0.2\mathrm{m}, 0.2\mathrm{m})$  while keeping all the other settings the same as other experiments. To be fair, we have kept the same number of queries as TransFusion [1]. Benefiting from deep feature interactions, our model exhibits consistent improvements over LiDAR-only baseline methods (see Figure 6) on both backbones (by  $5.5\%$  mAP for voxel-based backbone, and  $4.4\%$  mAP for pillar-based backbone). This result demonstrates the proposed DeepInteraction is generic to different point cloud encoding manners.

Where does the improvement come from? To investigate exactly where these improvements come from, we conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes val dataset to test the effectiveness of each component. From Table 2, we can see that the alternative interaction in the decoder brings a gain of  $0.7\%$  mAP and  $0.5\%$  NDS compared to the lidar-only baseline [1]. Further gains of  $3.5\%$  mAP and  $2.7\%$  NDS are achieved by the bidirectional multi-modal interactions before detection. This suggests that both our bilateral interaction encoder and multi-modal interaction decoder are helpful, and that interaction in the early stage (encoder) appears more critical than those in the decoder.

Bilateral interaction For an in-depth understanding of bilateral interaction encoder, we present a performance comparison about inner-modal interaction (denoted as 'Inner-Int.') and cross-modal interaction (denoted as 'Cross-Int.') in Table 3a. With only inner-modal interaction, there is a performance improvement of  $1.7\%$  mAP and  $1.2\%$  NDS. When only cross-modal interaction is introduced, the performance improves significantly by  $3.1\%$  mAP and  $1.8\%$  NDS. With both inner-modal and cross-modal interactions are applied, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with  $69.9\%$  mAP and  $72.7\%$  NDS.

Alternative interaction We study the impact of multi-modal interaction in the decoder. As shown in Table 3d, increasing the number of decoder layers can consistently improve the performance except that 6 layers experience a little performance drop. Table 3b shows the comparison between different interaction candidates, including Transformer decoder layer [1] and dynamic instance interaction. The second row of Table 3b presents the mixing strategy, i.e., using Transformer decoder layer for augmented LiDAR BEV features and Dync. for the augmented image features, which leads to a boost of  $0.7\%$  mAP compared with the pure Transformer counterparts. The best result comes from using Dync. for both modalities. This suggests that our multi-modal decoder with dynamic instance interaction is capable of exploiting the local context for specific object query. Since object queries are non-parametric and input-dependent [1], we can modify the number of queries during inference. In Table 3f, we report the results under different combinations of query numbers in the training and testing. As seen, the best performance is achieved when training the model with 200 queries and testing with 300 queries.

# 5 Conclusion

In this work, we have presented a novel 3D object detection architecture DeepInteraction for exploring the intrinsic inter-modal complementary nature. This key idea is to conduct bilateral interaction and association across modalities in representation learning. This strategy is designed particularly to resolve the fundamental limitation of existing alternatives that 2D multi-camera images are insufficiently exploited due to their auxiliary source role treatment. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that DeepInteraction surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, yielding new state of the art.
