# ABSTRACT

We propose NeuFace, a 3D face mesh pseudo annotation method on videos via neural re-parameterized optimization. Despite the huge progress in 3D face reconstruction methods, generating reliable 3D face labels for in-the-wild dynamic videos remains challenging. Using NeuFace optimization, we annotate the perview-/frame accurate and consistent face meshes on large-scale face videos, called the NeuFace-dataset. We investigate how neural re-parameterization helps to reconstruct 3D facial geometries, well complying with input facial gestures and motions. By exploiting the naturalness and diversity of 3D faces in our dataset, we demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset for 3D face-related tasks: improving the reconstruction accuracy of an existing 3D face reconstruction model and learning 3D facial motion prior. Code and datasets will be publicly available if accepted.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A comprehensive understanding of dynamic 3D human faces has been a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. Reconstructing and generating dynamic 3D human faces are key components for diverse tasks such as face recognition (Weyrauch et al., 2004; Blanz & Vetter, 2003), face forgery detection (Cozzolino et al., 2021; Rössler et al., 2018; 2019), video face editing (B R et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2018; Tewari et al., 2020), facial motion or expression transfer (Thies et al., 2015; 2016a; 2018), XR applications (Elgharib et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Richard et al., 2021), and human avatar generation (Raj et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Youwang et al., 2022).

Recent studies (Wood et al., 2021; 2022; Bae et al., 2023; Yeh et al., 2022) have shown that reliable datasets of facial geometry, even synthetic or pseudo ones, can help achieve a comprehensive understanding of "static" 3D faces. However, there is currently a lack of reliable and large-scale datasets containing "dynamic" and "natural" 3D facial motion annotations. The lack of such datasets becomes a bottleneck for studying inherent facial motion dynamics or 3D face reconstruction tasks by restricting them to rely on weak supervision, e.g., 2D landmarks or segmentation maps. Accurately acquired 3D face video data may mitigate such issues but typically requires intensive and time-consuming efforts with carefully calibrated multi-view cameras and controlled lighting conditions (Yoon et al., 2021; Joo et al., 2015; 2018; Cudeiro et al., 2019; Ranjan et al., 2018). Few seminal works (Fanelli et al., 2010; Ranjan et al., 2018; Cudeiro et al., 2019; Zielonka et al., 2022) take such effort to build 3D face video datasets. Despite significant efforts, the existing datasets obtained from such restricted settings are limited in scale, scenarios, diversity of actor identity and expression, and naturalness of facial motion (see Table 1).

In contrast to 3D, there are an incomparably large amount of 2D face video datasets available online (Wang et al., 2020; Nagrani et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2022; Parkhi et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2018; Karras et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021; 2019; Liu et al., 2015), which are captured in diverse in-the-wild environments but without 3D annotations. As successfully demonstrated in some 3D tasks (Fang et al., 2021; Bouazizi et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022; Müller et al., 2021; Hassan et al., 2019; Bayer et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2022) as well as other analysis tasks (Miech et al., 2019; Nagrani et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2021), leveraging off-the-shelf reconstruction models is a common practice to obtain pseudo ground-truth of such in-the-wild videos that were already captured. They showed that high-quality and large-scale pseudo ground-truth is sufficient to achieve the state-of-the-art at the time of their works. Similarly, a naive approach is to construct a large-scale 3D face video dataset by curating existing 2D video datasets and obtain 3D face annotations with off-the-shelf face reconstruction models (Feng et al., 2021; Danecek et al., 2022). However, existing 3D face

reconstruction models have limitations for reconstructing temporally smooth or multi-view consistent 3D face meshes from videos. This is because state-of-the-art face reconstruction models are typically trained on single-view static images only with 2D supervision; thus fail to extrapolate to faces having rare poses and yield jittered motion due to the per-frame independent inference.

To address these difficulties, we propose NeuFace optimization, which reconstructs accurate and spatio-temporally consistent parametric 3D face meshes on videos. By re-parameterizing 3D face meshes with neural network parameters, NeuFace infuses spatio-temporal cues of dynamic face videos on 3D face reconstruction. NeuFace optimizes spatio-temporal consistency losses and the 2D landmark loss to acquire reliable face mesh pseudo-labels for videos.

Using this method, we create the NeuFace-dataset, the first large-scale, accurate and spatio-temporally consistent 3D face meshes for videos. Our dataset contains 3D face mesh pseudo-labels for largescale, multi-view or in-the-wild 2D face videos, MEAD (Wang et al., 2020), VoxCeleb2 (Chung et al., 2018), and CelebV-HQ (Zhu et al., 2022), achieving about 1,000 times larger number of sequences than existing facial motion capture datasets (see Table 1). Our dataset inherits the benefits of the rich visual attributes in largescale face videos, e.g., various races, appearances, backgrounds, natural facial motions, and expressions. We assess the fi

delity of our dataset by investigating the cross-view vertex distance and the 3D motion stability index. We demonstrate that our dataset contains more spatio-temporally consistent and accurate 3D meshes than the competing datasets built with strong baseline methods. To demonstrate the potential of our dataset, we present two applications: (1) improving the accuracy of a face reconstruction model and (2) learning a generative 3D facial motion prior. These applications highlight that NeuFace-dataset can be further used in diverse applications demanding high-quality and large-scale 3D face meshes. We summarize our main contributions as follows:

# 2 RELATED WORK

3D face datasets. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of dynamic 3D faces, large-scale in-the-wild 3D face video datasets are essential. There exist large-scale 2D face datasets that provide expressive face images or videos (Wang et al., 2020; Nagrani et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2022; Parkhi et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2018; Karras et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2015) with diverse attributes covering a wide variety of appearances, races, environments, scenarios, and emotions. However, most 2D face datasets do not have corresponding 3D annotations, due to the difficulty of 3D face acquisition, especially for in-the-wild environments. Although some recent datasets (Yoon et al., 2021; Ranjan et al., 2018; Cudeiro et al., 2019; Zielonka et al., 2022; Wood et al., 2021) provide 3D face annotations with paired images or videos, they are acquired in the restricted and carefully controlled indoor capturing environment, e.g., laboratory, yielding small scale, unnatural facial expressions and a limited variety of facial identities or features. Achieving in-the-wild naturalness and acquiring true 3D labels would be mutually exclusive in the real-world. Due to the challenge of constructing a real-world 3D face dataset, FaceSynthetics (Wood et al., 2021) synthesizes large-scale

synthetic face images and annotations derived from synthetic 3D faces, but limited in that they only publish images and 2D annotations without 3D annotations, which restrict 3D face video applications. In this work, we present the NeuFace-dataset, the first large-scale 3D face mesh pseudo-labels paired with the existing in-the-wild 2D face video datasets, resolving the lack of the 3D face video datasets.

3D face reconstruction. To obtain reliable face meshes for large-scale face videos, we need accurate 3D face reconstruction methods for videos. Reconstructing accurate 3D faces from limited visual cues, e.g., a monocular image, is an ill-posed problem. Model-based approaches have been the mainstream to mitigate the ill-posedness and have advanced with the 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) (Blanz & Vetter, 1999; Paysan et al., 2009; Li et al., 2017) and 3DMM-based reconstruction methods (Zollhöfer et al., 2018; Egger et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021; Danecek et al., 2022; Zielonka et al., 2022).

3D face reconstruction methods can be categorized into learning-based and optimization-based approaches. The learning-based approaches, e.g., (Feng et al., 2021; Danecek et al., 2022; Zielonka et al., 2022; Sanyal et al., 2019a; an Tran et al., 2016), use neural networks trained on large-scale face image datasets to regress the 3DMM parameters from a single image. The optimization-based approaches (Blanz & Vetter, 2003; Huber et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2022; Thies et al., 2015; Gecer et al., 2019) optimize the 2D landmark or photometric losses with extra regularization terms directly over the 3DMM parameters. Given a specific image, these methods overfit to 2D landmarks observations, thus showing better 2D landmark fit than the learning-based methods. These approaches are suitable for our purpose in that we need accurate reconstruction that best fits each video. However, the regularization terms are typically hand-designed with prior assumptions that disregard the input image. These regularization terms often introduce mean shape biases (Feng et al., 2021; Pavlakos et al., 2019; Bogo et al., 2016; Joo et al., 2020), due to their independence to input data, which we call the data-independent prior. Also, balancing the losses and regularization is inherently cumbersome and may introduce initialization sensitivity and local minima issues (Joo et al., 2020; Pavlakos et al., 2019; Bogo et al., 2016; Choutas et al., 2020).

Instead of hand-designed regularization terms, we induce such effects by optimizing re-parameterized 3DMM parameters with a 3DMM regression neural network, called NeuFace optimization. Such network parameters are trained from large-scale real face images, which implicitly embed strong prior from the trained data. Thereby, we can leverage the favorable properties of the neural re-parameterization: 1) an input data-dependent initialization and prior in 3DMM parameter optimization, 2) less bias toward a mean shape, and 3) stable optimization robust to local minima by over-parameterized model (Cooper, 2021; Du et al., 2019a; Neyshabur et al., 2018; Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Du et al., 2019b). Similar re-parameterizations were proposed in (Joo et al., 2020; Grassal et al., 2022), but they focus on the human body in a single image input with fixed 2D landmark supervision, or use MLP to re-parameterize the per-vertex displacement of the 3D face. We extend it to dynamic faces in the multi-view and video settings by sharing the neural parameters across views and frames, and devise an alternating optimization to self-supervise spatio-temporal consistency.

# 3 NEUFACE: A 3D FACE MESH OPTIMIZATION FOR VIDEOS VIA NEURAL RE-PARAMETERIZATION

In this section, we introduce the neural re-parameterization of 3DMM (Sec. 3.1) and NeuFace, an optimization to obtain accurate and spatio-temporally consistent face meshes from face videos (Sec. 3.2). We discuss the benefit of neural re-parameterization (Sec. 3.3), and show the possibility of our system as a reliable face mesh annotator (Sec. 3.4).

# 3.1 NEURAL RE-PARAMETERIZATION OF 3D FACE MESHES

We use FLAME (Li et al., 2017), a renowned 3DMM, as a 3D face representation. 3D face mesh vertices  $\mathbf{M}$  and facial landmarks  $\mathbf{J}$  for  $F$  frame videos can be acquired with the differentiable skinning:  $\mathbf{M},\mathbf{J} = \mathrm{FLAME}(\mathbf{r},\pmb {\theta},\pmb {\beta},\pmb {\psi})$ , where  $\mathbf{r}\in \mathbb{R}^3$ ,  $\pmb {\theta}\in \mathbb{R}^{12}$ ,  $\pmb {\beta}\in \mathbb{R}^{100}$  and  $\psi \in \mathbb{R}^{50}$  denote the head orientation, face poses, face shape and expression coefficients, respectively. For simplicity, FLAME parameters  $\Theta$  can be represented as,  $\Theta = [\mathbf{r},\pmb {\theta},\pmb {\beta},\psi ]$ . We further re-parameterize the FLAME parameters  $\Theta$  and weak perspective camera parameters  $\mathbf{p}\in \mathbb{R}^{F\times 3}$  for video frames  $\{\mathbf{I}_f\}_{f = 1}^F$ , into a neural network,  $\Phi$ , with parameters  $\mathbf{w}$ , i.e.,  $[\Theta ,\mathbf{p}] = \Phi_{\mathbf{w}}(\{\mathbf{I}_f\}_{f = 1}^F)$ . We use the pre-trained DECA (Feng et al., 2021) or EMOCA (Danecek et al., 2022) encoder for  $\Phi_{\mathbf{w}}$ .

Figure 1: NeuFace optimization. Given 2D face videos, NeuFace optimizes spatio-temporally consistent 3D face meshes. NeuFace updates the neural network parameters that re-parameterize the 3D face meshes with 2D landmark loss and spatio-temporal consistency losses.

# 3.2 NEUFACE OPTIMIZATION

Given the  $N_F$  frames and  $N_V$  views of a face video  $\{\mathbf{I}_{f,v}\}_{f = 1,v = 1}^{N_F,N_V}$ , NeuFace aims to find the optimal neural network parameter  $\mathbf{w}^*$  that re-parameterizes accurate, multi-view and temporally consistent face meshes (see Fig. 1). The optimization objective is defined as:

$$
\mathbf {w} ^ {*} = \underset {\mathbf {w}} {\arg \min } \mathcal {L} _ {2 \mathrm {D}} + \lambda_ {\text {t e m p}} \mathcal {L} _ {\text {t e m p o r a l}} + \lambda_ {\text {v i e w}} \mathcal {L} _ {\text {m u l t i v i e w}}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $\{\lambda_{*}\}$  denotes the weights for each loss term. Complex temporal and multi-view dependencies among variables in the losses would make direct optimization difficult (Afonso et al., 2010; Salzmann, 2013; Zhang, 1993). We ease the optimization of Eq. (1) by introducing latent target variables for self-supervision in an Expectation-Maximization (EM) style optimization.

2D landmark loss. For each iteration  $t$ , we compute  $\mathcal{L}_{2\mathrm{D}}$  as a unary term, following the conventional 2D facial landmark re-projection loss (Feng et al., 2021; Danecek et al., 2022) for the landmarks in all different frames and views:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {2 D}} = \frac {1}{N _ {F} N _ {V}} \sum_ {f = 1, v = 1} ^ {N _ {F}, N _ {V}} \| \pi (\mathbf {J} _ {f, v} ^ {t} (\mathbf {w}), \mathbf {p} _ {f, v} ^ {t}) - \mathbf {j} _ {f, v} \| _ {1}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $\pi (\cdot ,\cdot)$  denotes the weak perspective projection, and  $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{w})$  is the 3D landmark from  $\Phi_{\mathbf{w}}(\cdot)$ . Eq. (2) computes the pixel distance between the pre-detected 2D facial landmarks  $\mathbf{j}$  and the regressed and projected 3D facial landmarks  $\pi (\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{w}),\mathbf{p})$ .  $\mathbf{j}$  stays the same for the whole optimization. We use FAN (Bulat & Tzimiropoulos, 2017) to obtain  $\mathbf{j}$  with human verification to reject the failure cases.

Temporal consistency loss. Our temporal consistency loss reduces facial motion jitter caused by per-frame independent mesh regression on videos. Instead of a complicated Markov chain style loss, for each iteration  $t$ , we first estimate latent target meshes that represent temporally smooth heads in Expectation step (E-step). Then, we simply maximize the likelihood of regressed meshes to its corresponding latent target in Maximization step (M-step). In E-step, we feed  $\{\mathbf{I}_{f,v}\}_{f=1}^{N_F,N_V}$  into the network  $\Phi_{\mathbf{w}^t}$  and obtain FLAME and camera parameters,  $[\Theta^t,\mathbf{p}^t]$ . For multiple frames in view  $v$ , we extract the head orientations  $\mathbf{r}_{:,v}^t$ , from  $\Theta^t$  and convert it to the unit quaternion  $\mathbf{q}_{:,v}^t$ . To generate the latent target, i.e., temporally smooth head orientations  $\hat{\mathbf{q}}_{:,v}^t$ , we take the temporal moving average over  $\mathbf{q}_{:,v}^t$ . In M-step, we compute the temporal consistency loss as:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {t e m p o r a l}} = \frac {1}{N _ {F} N _ {V}} \sum_ {f = 1, v = 1} ^ {N _ {F}, N _ {V}} \| \mathbf {q} _ {f, v} ^ {t} - \hat {\mathbf {q}} _ {f, v} ^ {t} \| _ {2}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $\mathbf{q}$  is the unit-quaternion representation of  $\mathbf{r}$ . We empirically found that such simple consistency loss is sufficient enough to obtain temporal smoothness while allowing more flexible expressions.

Multi-view consistency loss. Although the aforementioned  $\mathcal{L}_{2\mathrm{D}}$  roughly guides the multiview consistency of landmarks, it cannot guarantee the consistency for off-landmark or invisible facial regions across views. Therefore, for multi-view captured face videos (Wang et al., 2020), we leverage a simple principle to obtain consistent meshes over different views: face geometry should be consistent across views at the same time. The goal is to bootstrap the per-view estimated noisy meshes by referencing the visible, or highly confident facial regions across different views. Analogous to the temporal consistency loss, in M-step, we compute the multiview consistency loss as follows:

![](images/4b2f80a612a45b144a7dda466f5fef5e9aed215d4426ad10baa788167b13a7d2.jpg)  
Figure 2: Multi-view bootstrapping. Given initial mesh predictions for each view in frame  $f$ , we align and merge the meshes depending on the confidence. The boostrapped mesh serves as a target for computing  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{multiview}}$ .

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {m u l t i v i e w}} = \frac {1}{N _ {F} N _ {V}} \sum_ {f = 1, v = 1} ^ {N _ {F}, N _ {V}} \| \mathbf {M} _ {f, v} ^ {t} - \hat {\mathbf {M}} _ {f} ^ {t} \| _ {1}, \tag {4}
$$

where  $\hat{\mathbf{M}}_f^t$  denotes the latent target mesh vertices estimated in E-step of each iteration. In E-step, given vertices  $\mathbf{M}_{f,:}^t$ , of multiple views in frame  $f$ , we interpret the vertex visibility as the per-vertex confidence. We assign the confidence score per each vertex by measuring the angle between the vertex normal and the camera ray. We set the vertices as invisible. We set the vertices as invisible if the angle is larger than the threshold  $\tau_{a}$ , and the vertex has a deeper depth than  $\tau_{z}$ , i.e.,  $z < \tau_{z}$ . We empirically choose  $\tau_{a} = 72^{\circ}$ ,  $\tau_{z} = -0.08$ . To obtain the latent target mesh  $\hat{\mathbf{M}}_f^t$ , we align per-view estimated meshes to the canonical view, and bootstrap the meshes by taking the weighted average of  $\mathbf{M}_{f,:}^t$  depending on the confidence (see Fig. 2). With this, Eq. (4) constrains the vertices of each view to be consistent with  $\hat{\mathbf{M}}_f^t$ .

Overall process. We first estimate all the latent variables,  $\hat{\mathbf{q}}$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$  as E-step. With the estimated latent variables as the self-supervision target, we optimize Eq. (1) over the network parameter  $\mathbf{w}$  as M-step. This single alternating iteration updates the optimization parameter  $\mathbf{w}^t\rightarrow \mathbf{w}^{t + 1}$  at iteration  $t$ . We iterate alternating E-step and M-step until convergence. After convergence, we obtain the final solution  $[\Theta^{*},\mathbf{p}^{*}]$  by querying video frames to the optimized network, i.e.,  $[\Theta^{*},\mathbf{p}^{*}] = \Phi_{\mathbf{w}^{*}}(\{\mathbf{I}_{f,v}\}_{f = 1,v = 1}^{N_{F},N_{V}})$ .

# 3.3 WHY IS NEUFACE OPTIMIZATION EFFECTIVE?

Note that one can simply update FLAME parameters directly with the same loss in Eq. (1). Then, why do we need neural re-parameterization of 3D face meshes? We claim such neural re-parameterization allows data-dependent mesh update, which the FLAME fitting cannot achieve. To support our claim, we analyze the benefit of our optimization by comparing it with the solid baseline.

Baseline: FLAME fitting. Given the same video frames  $\{\mathbf{I}_{f,v}\}_{f = 1,v = 1}^{N_F,N_V}$  and the same initial FLAME and camera parameters  $[\Theta_{\mathbf{b}},\mathbf{p}_{\mathbf{b}}]$  as  $\mathrm{NeuFace}^2$ , we implement the baseline optimization as:

$$
\left[ \Theta_ {\mathbf {b}} ^ {*}, \mathbf {p} _ {\mathbf {b}} ^ {*} \right] = \underset {\Theta_ {\mathbf {b}}, \mathbf {p} _ {\mathbf {b}}} {\arg \min } \mathcal {L} _ {2 D} + \lambda_ {\text {t e m p}} \mathcal {L} _ {\text {t e m p o r a l}} + \lambda_ {\text {v i e w}} \mathcal {L} _ {\text {m u l t i v e w}} + \lambda_ {\mathbf {r}} \mathcal {L} _ {\mathbf {r}} + \lambda_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \mathcal {L} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} + \lambda_ {\boldsymbol {\beta}} \mathcal {L} _ {\boldsymbol {\beta}} + \lambda_ {\psi} \mathcal {L} _ {\psi}, \tag {5}
$$

where the losses  $\mathcal{L}_{2\mathrm{D}}$ ,  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{temporal}}$  and  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{multiview}}$  are identical to the Eqs. (2), (3), and (4).  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{r}}$ ,  $\mathcal{L}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ ,  $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$  and  $\mathcal{L}_{\psi}$ , are the common regularization terms used in (Li et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2022).

Data-dependent gradients for mesh update. We analyze the data-dependency of the baseline and NeuFace optimization by investigating back-propagated gradients. For the FLAME fitting (Eq. (5)), the update rule for FLAME parameters  $\Theta_{\mathrm{b}}$  at optimization step  $t$  is as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol {\Theta} _ {\mathbf {b}} ^ {t + 1} = \boldsymbol {\Theta} _ {\mathbf {b}} ^ {t} - \alpha \frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \boldsymbol {\Theta} _ {\mathbf {b}} ^ {t}}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\mathcal{L}$  denotes the sum of all the losses used in the optimization. In contrast, given video frames  $\{\mathbf{I}_{f,v}\}_{f = 1,v = 1}^{N_F,N_V}$ , or simply  $\mathbf{I}$ , the update for our NeuFace optimization is as follows:

$$
\mathbf {w} ^ {t + 1} = \mathbf {w} ^ {t} - \alpha \frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \mathbf {w} ^ {t}} = \mathbf {w} ^ {t} - \alpha \left(\frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \boldsymbol {\Theta} _ {\mathbf {w}} ^ {t}} \cdot \frac {\partial \boldsymbol {\Theta} _ {\mathbf {w}} ^ {t}}{\partial \mathbf {w} ^ {t}}\right) = \mathbf {w} ^ {t} - \alpha \left(\frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \boldsymbol {\Theta} _ {\mathbf {w}} ^ {t}} \cdot \frac {\partial}{\partial \mathbf {w} ^ {t}} \Phi_ {\mathbf {w} ^ {t}} (\mathbf {I})\right), \tag {7}
$$

where  $\Theta_{\mathbf{w}}^t$  is re-/over-parameterized by the neural network  $\Phi_{\mathbf{w}^t}$ , i.e.,  $\Theta_{\mathbf{w}}^t = \Phi_{\mathbf{w}^t}(\mathbf{I})$ .

By comparing the back-propagated gradient terms in Eqs. (6) and (7), we can intuitively notice that the update for NeuFace optimization (Eq. (7)) is conditioned by input  $\mathbf{I}$ , yielding data-dependent mesh update. With data-dependent gradient  $\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{w}^t} \Phi_{\mathbf{w}^t}(\mathbf{I})$ , NeuFace optimization may inherit the implicit prior embedded in the pre-trained neural model, e.g., DECA (Feng et al., 2021), learned from large-scale real face images. This allows NeuFace optimization to obtain expressive 3D facial geometries, well complying with input facial gestures and motions.

It is also worthwhile to note that, thanks to over-parameterization of  $\Phi_{\mathbf{w}}(\cdot)$  w.r.t.  $\Theta$ , we benefit from the following favorable property. For simplicity, we consider a simple  $l_{2}$ -loss and a fully connected ReLU network, but it is sufficient to understand the mechanism of NeuFace optimization.

Proposition 1 (Informal). Global convergence. For the input data  $\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^{n \times d_{in}}$ , paired labels  $\mathbf{y}^* \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_{out}}$ , and an over-parameterized  $L$ -layer fully connected network  $\Phi_{\mathbf{w}}(\cdot)$  with ReLU activation and uniform weight widths, consider optimizing the non-convex problem:  $\arg \min_{\mathbf{w}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{2}\|\Phi_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{y}^*\|_2^2$ . Under some assumptions, gradient descent finds a global optimum in polynomial time with high probability.

Proposition 1 can be derived by simply recompositing the results by Allen-Zhu et al. (2019). Its proof sketch can be found in the supplementary material. This hints that our over-parameterization helps NeuFace optimization achieve robustness to local minima and avoid mean shape biases.

To see how data-dependent gradient of NeuFace affects the mesh optimization, we visualize the absolute magnitude of the back-propagated gradients of each method in Fig. 3. The baseline optimization produces a sparse gradient map along the face landmarks, which disregards the pixel-level facial details, e.g., wrinkles or facial boundaries. In contrast, NeuFace additionally induces the dense gradients over face surfaces, not just sparse landmarks, which are helpful for representing image

aligned and detailed facial expressions on meshes. Thanks to the rich gradient map, our method yields more expressive and accurately image-aligned meshes than the baseline.

Figure 3: Data-dependent gradient. NeuFace optimization obtains a richer gradient map regarding the pixel-level facial details (1st row). Thus, our method achieves more expressive and accurately meshes than the baseline (2nd row).

# 3.4 HOW RELIABLE IS NEUFACE OPTIMIZATION?

Many recent face-related applications (Ng et al., 2022; Khakhulin et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2022) utilize a pre-trained, off-the-shelf 3D face reconstruction model or the FLAME fitting (Eq. (5)) as a pseudo ground-truth annotator. Compared to such conventional face mesh annotation methods, we discuss how reliable Neuface optimization is. Specifically, we measure the vertex-level accuracy of the reconstructed face meshes by NeuFace optimization on the motion capture videos, VOCASET (Cudeiro et al., 2019).

VOCASET is a small-scale facial motion capture dataset that provides registered ground-truth mesh

sequences. Given the ground-truth mesh sequences from the VOCASET, we evaluate the Mean-Per-Vertex-Error (MPVE) (Cho et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2021b;a) of face meshes obtained by pre-trained DECA, FLAME fitting and our method. In Fig. 4, NeuFace optimization achieves more vertex-level accurate meshes than other methods, i.e., lower MPVE. Note that FLAME fitting still achieves competitive MPVE with ours, which shows that it is a valid, strong baseline. Such favorable mesh accuracy of NeuFace optimization motivates us to leverage it as a reliable face mesh annotator for large-scale face videos, and build the NeuFace-dataset.

# 4 THE NEUFACE-DATASET

The NeuFace-dataset provides accurate and spatio-temporally consistent face meshes of existing large-scale 2D face video datasets; MEAD (Wang et al., 2020), VoxCeleb2 (Chung et al., 2018), and CelebV-HQ (Zhu et al., 2022) (see Fig. 5). Our datasets are denoted with  $\mathbf{NeuFace}_{\{*\}}$  and summarized in Table 1. The NeuFace-dataset is, namely, the largest 3D face mesh pseudo-labeled dataset in terms of the scale, naturalness, and diversity of facial attributes, emotions, and backgrounds. Please refer to the supplementary material for the dataset acquisition and filtering details.

We assess the fidelity of our dataset in terms of spatio-temporal consistency and landmark accuracy. We make competing datasets and compare the quality of the generated mesh annotations. First, we compose the strong baseline, Base-dataset, by fitting FLAME with Eq. (5). We also utilize pre-trained DECA and EMOCA as mesh annotators and built DECA-dataset and EMOCA-dataset, respectively. Finally, we build two versions of our dataset, i.e., NeuFace-D, and NeuFace-E, where each dataset is generated via Eq. (1) with DECA and EMOCA for the neural re-parameterization  $\Phi_{\mathbf{w}}$ , respectively.

Temporal consistency. We extend the Motion Stability Index (MSI) (Ling et al., 2022) to  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}$  and evaluate the temporal consistency of each dataset.  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}$  computes a reciprocal of the motion acceleration variance of either 3D landmarks or vertices and quantifies facial motion stability for a given  $N_F$  frame video,  $\{\mathbf{I}_f\}_{f = 1}^{N_F}$ , as  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}(\{\mathbf{I}_f\}_{f = 1}^{N_F}) = \frac{1}{K}\sum_i\frac{1}{\sigma(\mathbf{a}^i)}$ , where  $\mathbf{a}^i$  denotes the 3D motion acceleration of  $i$ -th 3D landmarks or vertices,  $\sigma (\cdot)$  the temporal variance, and  $K$  the number of landmarks or vertices. If the mesh sequence has small temporal jittering, i.e., low motion variance, it has a high  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}$  value. We compute  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}$  for landmarks and vertices, i.e.,  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}^{\mathrm{L}}$  and  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}^{\mathrm{V}}$ , respectively. Table 2 shows the  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}^{\mathrm{L}}$  and  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}^{\mathrm{V}}$  averaged over the validation sets. For the VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ splits, the NeuFace-D/E-dataset outperform the other datasets in both  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{Ds}}$ . Remarkably, we have improvements on  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}$  more than 20 times in MEAD. We postulate

that the multi-view consistency loss also strengthens the temporal consistency for MEAD. In other words, our losses would be mutually helpful when jointly optimized. We discuss it through loss ablation studies in the supplementary material.

Multi-view consistency. We visualize the predicted meshes over different views in Fig. 6, where per-view independent estimations are presented, not a single merged one. We verify that the NeuFace-D-dataset contains multi-view consistent meshes compared to the DECA-dataset, especially near the mouth region. See supplementary material for the comparison of the EMOCA-dataset and NeuFace-E-dataset. As a quantitative measure, we compute the crossview vertex distance (CVD), i.e., the vertex distance between two different views,  $i$  and  $j$ , in the same frame  $f$ :  $\| \mathbf{M}_{f,i} - \mathbf{M}_{f,j}\| _1$ . We compare the averaged CVD of all views in Table 2. CVD is only evaluated on the MEAD dataset,

which is in a multi-camera setup. While the DECA-/EMOCA-dataset results in high CVD, the NeuFace-dataset shows significantly lower CVD on overall views.

Figure 6: Multi-view consistent face meshes. NeuFace-dataset contains multi-view consistent meshes compared to the DECA-dataset. L- and R denote Left and Right, and 30 and 60 denote the camera view angles from the center.

2D landmark accuracy. A trivial solution to obtain low CVD and high  $\mathrm{MSI}_{3\mathrm{D}}$  is to regress the same mean face meshes across views and frames regardless of the input image. To verify such occurrence, we measure the landmark accuracy of the regressed 2D facial landmarks using the normalized mean error (NME) (Sagonas et al., 2016). The NeuFace-D/E-dataset outperform the other datasets in NME, i.e., contain spatio-temporally consistent and accurately landmark-aligned meshes.

# 5 APPLICATIONS OF THE NEUFACE-DATASETS

In this section, we demonstrate the usefulness of the NeuFace-dataset. We boost the accuracy of an off-the-shelf face mesh regressor by exploiting our dataset's 3D supervision (Sec. 5.1). Also, we learn generative facial motion prior from the large-scale, in-the-wild 3D faces in our dataset (Sec. 5.2).

# 5.1 IMPROVING THE 3D RECONSTRUCTION ACCURACY

Due to the absence of large-scale 3D face video datasets, existing face mesh regressor models utilize limited visual cues, such as 2D landmarks or segmentations. Thus, we utilize the NeuFace-dataset to add direct 3D supervision to enhance the performance of such a model.

3D supervision with the NeuFace-dataset. We implement the auxiliary 3D supervision as conventional 3D vertex and landmark losses (Kolotouros et al., 2019; Cho et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2021b;a). Given regressed and our annotated mesh vertices,  $\mathbf{M},\hat{\mathbf{M}}\in \mathbb{R}^{N_M\times 3}$ , and regressed and our annotated 3D landmarks,  $\mathbf{J},\hat{\mathbf{J}}\in \mathbb{R}^{N_J\times 3}$ , the auxiliary 3D losses are computed as:  $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{3D}}^{\mathrm{M}} = \frac{1}{N_M}\| \mathbf{M} - \hat{\mathbf{M}}\| _2$ $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{3D}}^{\mathrm{J}} = \frac{1}{N_J}\| \mathbf{J} - \hat{\mathbf{J}}\| _2$ , where  $N_{M}$ ,  $N_{J}$  is the number of mesh vertices and landmarks, respectively.

Enhancement on 3D reconstruction accuracy. By fine-tuning DECA (Feng et al., 2021) using the images of MEAD (Wang et al., 2020), VoxCeleb2 (Chung et al., 2018) and CelebV-HQ (Zhu et al., 2022), with and without our 3D supervision, we obtain  $\mathrm{DECA}_{\mathrm{NeuFace},3\mathrm{D}}$  and  $\mathrm{DECA}_{\mathrm{NeuFace},2\mathrm{D}}$ . Following the evaluation protocol of the NoW benchmark (Sanyal et al., 2019a), we reconstruct 3D faces for the provided images via each model and report the 3D reconstruction errors. In Table 3, our  $\mathrm{DECA}_{\mathrm{NeuFace},3\mathrm{D}}$  shows lower 3D reconstruction error than  $\mathrm{DECA}_{\mathrm{original}}$  and  $\mathrm{DECA}_{\mathrm{NeuFace},2\mathrm{D}}$ .

# 5.2 LEARNING 3D HUMAN FACIAL MOTION PRIOR

A facial motion prior is a versatile tool to understand how human faces move over time. It can generate realistic motions or regularize temporal 3D reconstruction (Rempe et al., 2021). Unfortunately, the

lack of large-scale 3D face video datasets makes learning facial motion prior infeasible. We tackle this by exploiting the scale, diversity, and naturalness of the 3D facial motions in our dataset.

Learning facial motion prior. We learn a 3D facial motion prior using HuMoR (Rempe et al., 2021) with simple modifications. HuMoR is a conditional VAE (Sohn et al., 2015) that learns the transition distribution of human body motion. We represent the state of a facial motion sequence as the combination of FLAME parameters and landmarks in the NeuFace-dataset and train the dedicated face motion prior, called HuMoR-Face. We train three motion prior models (HuMoR-Face) with different training datasets, i.e., VOCASET (Cudeiro et al., 2019), NeuFaceMEAD, and NeuFaceVoxCeleb2. Please refer to supplementary material and HuMoR (Rempe et al., 2021) for the details.

Long-term face motion generation. We evaluate the validity and generative power of the learned motion prior by generating long-term 3D face motion sequences (10.0s). Long-term motions are generated by auto-regressive sampling from the learned prior, given only a starting frame as the condition (see Fig. 7). VOCASET provides small-scale, in-the-lab captured meshes, thus limited in motion naturalness and facial diversity. Accordingly, the HuMoR-Face trained with VOCASET fails to learn a valid human facial motion prior and generates unnatural motion. Using only the subset,  $\mathrm{NeuFace}_{\mathrm{MEAD}}$ , the long-term stability of head motion has significantly enhanced. We attribute such high quality prior to the benefit of the NeuFacedataset: large-scale facial motion annotations. Further, exploiting diverse in-thewild, dynamic, and natural motion anno

tation from NeuFaceVoxCeleb2 helps HuMoR-Face learn real-world motion prior and surprisingly generate much diverse and dynamic motions.

Figure 7: Long-term facial motion generation using learned motion prior. The motion prior trained with small-scale, diversity-limited VOCASET fails to generate natural motion, while the motion prior trained with NeuFaceVoxCeleb2 generates diverse and natural long-term facial motion.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We develop NeuFace, an optimization for generating accurate and spatio-temporally consistent 3D face mesh pseudo-labels on videos with provable optimal guarantee. Moreover, with the technique, we build the NeuFace-dataset, a large-scale 3D face meshes paired with in-the-wild 2D videos. We demonstrate the potential of the diversity and naturalness of our NeuFace-dataset as a training dataset to learn generative 3D facial motion prior. Also, we improve the reconstruction accuracy of a de-facto standard 3D face reconstruction model using our dataset. We expect NeuFace to open up new opportunities by providing large-scale, real-world 3D face video data, the NeuFace-dataset, as a reliable data curation method.

# ETHICS STATEMENT

For face reconstruction tasks and datasets, the diversity of race or ethnicity, gender, appearance, and actions is an important topic to discuss (Wang et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2022). Existing 3D face video datasets (Zielonka et al., 2022; Ranjan et al., 2018; Cudeiro et al., 2019) typically have limited diversity regarding ethnicity, gender, appearance, and actions. Such 3D face datasets rarely provide video pairs, but with artificial facial markers attached to human faces and a small set of identities. On the other hand, our NeuFace-dataset mitigates such issues since our dataset is acquired on top of large-scale in-the-wild face video datasets, which typically rely on internet videos. Such video datasets are diverse in terms of ethnicity, gender, facial appearances, and actions when compared to the small/medium-scale 3D facial motion capture datasets. Since our dataset is acquired based on the existing public video datasets (Wang et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2022), all the rights, licenses, and permissions follow the original datasets. Moreover, we will release the NeuFace-dataset by providing the reconstructed 3DMM parameters without the actual facial video frames. NeuFace-dataset does not contain identity-specific metadata and facial texture maps. Nonetheless, per-identity shape coefficients can give a rough guide about human facial shape. Thus, we will release our dataset for research purposes only.

# REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

We will make our code and data accessible to the public once it is published.
