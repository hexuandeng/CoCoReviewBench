# ABSTRACT

The generalized smooth condition,  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smoothness, has triggered people's interest since it is more realistic in many optimization problems shown by both empirical and theoretical evidence. To solve the generalized smooth optimization, gradient clipping methods are often employed, and have theoretically been shown to be as effective as the traditional gradient-based methods(Chen et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024). However, whether these methods can be safely extended to zeroth-order case is still unstudied. To answer this important question, we propose a zeroth-order normalized gradient method(ZONSPIDER) for both finite sum and general expectation case, and we prove that we can find  $\epsilon$ -stationary point of  $f(x)$  with optimal decay on  $d$  and  $\epsilon$ , specifically, the complexes are  $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-2}\sqrt{n}\max \{L_0,L_1\})$  in the finite sum case and  $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-3}\max \{\sigma_1^2,\sigma_0^2\} \max \{L_0,L_1\})$  in the general expectation case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that sample complexity bounds are established for a zeroth-order method under generalized smoothness.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In the paper, we consider solving the following stochastic finite-sum optimization problems.  $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}$

$$
\underset {x \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} f (x) = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} f _ {i} (x) \quad (\text {f i n i t e s u m c a s e}) \tag {1}
$$

where  $f(x)$  and each  $f_{i}(x)$  are both differentiable and possibly nonconvex functions, which captures the standard empirical risk minimization problems in machine learning. Additionally, when dealing with a substantial or potentially infinite number of data samples, such as in online or streaming scenarios, we consider the following general expectation optimization problem:

$$
\underset {x \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} f (x) \equiv \mathbb {E} [ f (x; \xi) ] \quad (\text {g e n e r a l}
$$

where  $\xi$  is a random variable following an unknown distribution. In recent years, significant progress has been made in addressing this problem under the  $L$ -smooth assumption, with numerous studies contributing to this area. Notable examples include stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Ghadimi and Lan, 2013), and variance reduction methods (Johnson and Zhang, 2013; Fang et al., 2018; Cutkosky and Orabona, 2019) under stochastic smoothness, which have demonstrated faster convergence. Several works have explored the fastest achievable rates in stochastic optimization. (Han et al., 2024; Zhou and Gu, 2019) established a lower bound of  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\sqrt{n} + n)$  for the finite-sum case, while (Arjevani et al., 2022) set a lower bound of  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3}\sigma + \epsilon^{-2}\sigma^2)$  for the general expectation case. Despite these strong theoretical results, they all rely on the  $L$ -smooth assumption, which may not hold in critical applications such as LSTM (Zhang et al., 2019). A key observation is that the smoothness parameter  $L$  scales with the gradient norm, leading to the introduction of the generalized  $(L_0, L_1)$ -smooth assumption:

$$
\left\| \nabla f (x) - \nabla f \left(x ^ {\prime}\right) \right\| \leq \left(L _ {0} + L _ {1} \| \nabla f (x) \|\right) \| x - x ^ {\prime} \| \tag {3}
$$

Since the traditional  $L$ -smooth assumption is a special case where  $L_{1} = 0$ , solving problems under the more general  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth condition is harder. To address this, (Zhang et al., 2019) introduced

a gradient clipping method that finds an  $\epsilon$ -stationary point in  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$  iterations, demonstrating that it can be arbitrarily faster than gradient descent (GD) when the problem has poor initialization. In the traditional  $L$ -smooth case, variance reduction methods achieve an  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$  rate, motivating exploration of similar techniques under the  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth condition. Recent works (Chen et al., 2023; Reisizadeh et al., 2023) achieved this  $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$  rate by incorporating SPIDER (Fang et al., 2018). Thus, the  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth case can be as effective as the traditional  $L$ -smooth assumption with first-order oracle.

On the other hand, these methods require access to the gradient of the objective function, however in some important applications the explicit expressions of gradients of the objective function are expensive or infeasible to obtain, and only function evaluations are accessible. Such as class of applications include black-box adversarial attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) (Papernot et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017) and reinforcement learning (Malik et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2020). Zeroth-order optimization is a fundamental research topic serving as a prototype module for above numerous tasks. However, all of zeroth-order optimization only studied under traditional  $L$ -smooth assumption. This motivates us to explore zeroth-order optimization methods under  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth case, as mentioned in the previous discussion, SGD can't be directly applied to  $(L_0,L_1)$  case, leading to the natural question:

Can zeroth-order methods solve generalized  $(L_0, L_1)$ -smooth nonconvex problems as efficiently as solving traditional smooth nonconvex problems? In particular, what convergence rates can be achieved?

This paper answers this question by proposing a zeroth-order normalized gradient method, which can find a stationary point of  $f(x)$  with  $\mathcal{O}(d\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2}\max \{L_1,L_0\})$  in finite sum case and  $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-3}\max \{L_1,L_0\} \max \{\sigma_1,\sigma_0\})$  in expectation case, both enjoy the optimal dependency on  $\epsilon$  and  $d$ , to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that sample complexity bounds are established for a zeroth-order method under generalized smoothness.

# 1.1 RELATED WORKS

Among the related works, the most relevant to ours are (Reisizadeh et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2019a). Compared to (Reisizadeh et al., 2023), while we both analyze SPIDER under the  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth setting, we also explore the zeroth-order case. Their complexity includes an  $\mathcal{O}(1 / L_1)$  term, which makes their analysis inapplicable to the traditional  $L_{0}$ -smooth case, as  $1 / L_{1}\rightarrow \infty$ . In contrast to (Chen et al., 2023), though both analyze SPIDER under  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smoothness, we further address the zeroth-order and finite-sum cases. Similarly, compared to (Ji et al., 2019a), while we both use a minibatch version of the rand gradient estimator, we extend the analysis to  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smoothness and have additional analysis of expectation settings. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. Through the combination of normalized SPIDER and two zeroth-order estimator (called coord and rand gradient estimators), we first give analysis of zeroth-order method under  $(L_0, L_1)$ -smooth and  $(\sigma_0, \sigma_1)$ -variance settings, the takeaway of our paper is that zeroth-order method  $(L_0, L_1)$  can as effective as in  $L$ -smooth case. Especially, our method requires weaker assumptions to find an  $\epsilon$ -stationary point of the black-box optimization problems 1 and 2, as shown in Table 1.  
2. We give convergence analysis of coord and rand gradient estimators in both finite sum and general expectation cases. Moreover, the proposed methods achieve optimal dependence on  $\epsilon$  and  $d$ ,  $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-2}\sqrt{n}\max \{L_0,L_1\})$  in finite sum case and  $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-3}\max \{L_1,L_0\} \max \{\sigma_0^2,\sigma_1^2\})$  in expectation case, which means we can use zeroth-order method to solve  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth problem safely, as shown in Table 2.  
3. We conduct experiments to give advice on parameters choice in practice and verify the effectiveness of our method.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

Throughout the paper,  $\| \cdot \|$  denotes the Euclidean norm for vectors, and operator norm for matrices. We use the symbol  $\lfloor x\rfloor$  to denote the integer part of  $x$ .

Assumption 1  $((L_0, L_1)$ -smooth). A differentiable function  $f$  is said to be  $(L_0, L_1)$ -smooth if there exist constants  $L_0 > 0$ ,  $L_1 \geq 0$  such that if  $\|x_1 - x_2\| \leq 1 / L_1$ , then

$$
\left\| \nabla f (x _ {1}) - \nabla f (x _ {2}) \right\| \leq \left(L _ {0} + L _ {1} \| \nabla f (x _ {1}) \|\right) \| x _ {1} - x _ {2} \|.
$$

This also implies

$$
f \left(x _ {2}\right) - f \left(x _ {1}\right) - \langle \nabla f \left(x _ {1}\right), x _ {2} - x _ {1} \rangle \leq \frac {\left(L _ {0} + L _ {1} \| \nabla f \left(x _ {1}\right) \|\right)}{2} \| x _ {1} - x _ {2} \| ^ {2}.
$$

Assumption 2 (Stochastic case). In stochastic case, we need the following assumptions

- (i): In general expectation case, the stochastic oracle  $f(x; \xi)$  is unbiased, i.e.,  $\mathbb{E}[f(x; \xi)] = f(x)$ , and  $\mathbb{E}[\nabla f(x; \xi)] = \nabla f(x)$ .  
- (ii): We suppose variance of stochastic gradient is  $(\sigma_0, \sigma_1)$ -variance-bounded:  $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(x; \xi) - \nabla f(x)\|^2] \leq \sigma_0^2 + \sigma_1^2 \|\nabla f(x)\|^2$ .  
- (iii): For  $\| x_1 - x_2 \| \leq \frac{1}{2L_1}$ , we suppose  $(L_0, L_1)$ -condition holds in stochastic case, in general expectation case, we suppose:

$$
\left\| \nabla f (x _ {1}; \xi) - \nabla f (x _ {2}; \xi) \right\| \leq \left(L _ {0} + L _ {1} \| \nabla f (x _ {1}) \|\right) \| x _ {1} - x _ {2} \|,
$$

infinite sum case:

$$
\left\| \nabla f _ {i} \left(x _ {1}\right) - \nabla f _ {i} \left(x _ {2}\right) \right\| \leq \left(L _ {0} + L _ {1} \| \nabla f \left(x _ {1}\right) \|\right) \| x _ {1} - x _ {2} \|.
$$

Remark 1. Instead of assuming traditional bounded variance assumption, we make a weaker assumption, called  $(\sigma_0,\sigma_1)$ -variance. Traditional bounded variance assumption is a special case that  $\sigma_{1} = 0$  (Xie et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023), we emphasize that this assumption is only needed in general expectation case, we don't need this assumption in finite sum case.

Assumption 3. We suppose  $f(x)$  has bounded minimum value  $\Delta \coloneqq f(x_0) - f(x^*) < \infty$ .

Definition 1 (ε-stationary point). We say  $x$  is an  $\epsilon$ -stationary point of  $f(x)$  if  $\| \nabla f(x) \| \leq \epsilon$  or  $f(x) - f^{*} \leq \epsilon$ .

# 3 PROPOSED METHOD

In this section, we will introduce our method for solving both the finite-sum and expectation minimization problems. Firstly, we introduce the coord and rand zeroth-order gradient estimators and analyze the properties of these gradient operators under generalized-smooth conditions.

# 3.1 ZEROTH-ORDER GRADIENT ESTIMATOR

# 3.1.1 RAND ESTIMATOR ANALYSIS UNDER GENERALIZED SMOOTHNESS

We first introduce smoothing function as follows:

$$
f _ {\mu} (x) := \mathbb {E} _ {\{w \sim U _ {b} \}} [ f (x + \mu w) ],
$$

where  $U_{b}$  is a uniform distribution over the unit Euclidean ball, following (Gao et al., 2017), its gradient can be expressed as  $\nabla f_{\mu}(x)\coloneqq \mathbb{E}_{\{v\sim U_{S_p}\}}\left[\frac{n}{\mu} f(x + \mu v)v\right]$ . Here  $U_{S_p}$  is a uniform distribution over the unit Euclidean sphere, and  $v\in \mathbb{R}^d$  is a random vector sampled from  $U_{S_p}$ .

We define zeroth-order rand estimator  $\bar{\nabla} f(x)$  as follows, which is an unbiased estimator of  $\nabla f_{\mu}(x)$ :

$$
\bar {\nabla} f (x) := \frac {d}{\mu} [ f (x + \mu v) - f (x) ] v, \quad (\text {r a n d e s t i m a t o r})
$$

we also define the minibatch version of rand estimator using  $S$  smoothing vector  $v_{j}$ :

$$
\bar {\nabla} _ {S} f (x) := \frac {1}{S} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {S} \frac {d}{\mu} [ f (x + \mu v _ {j}) - f (x) ] v _ {j}, \tag {4}
$$

in stochastic case that we can't access to  $f(x)$ , we define the stochastic version of rand estimator in general expectation case and finite sum case:

$$
\bar {\nabla} _ {S} f (x; \xi) := \frac {1}{S} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {S} \frac {d}{\mu} [ f (x + \mu v _ {j}; \xi) - f (x; \xi) ] v _ {j}, \bar {\nabla} _ {S} f _ {i} (x) := \frac {1}{S} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {S} \frac {d}{\mu} [ f _ {i} (x + \mu v _ {j}) - f _ {i} (x) ] v _ {j}.
$$

Rand estimator is an unbiased estimate of the gradient of the smoothing function(Gao et al., 2017), i.e,  $\mathbb{E}[\overline{\nabla}_S f(x)] = \mathbb{E}[\overline{\nabla} f(x)] = \nabla f_\mu (x)$

For rand estimator we have the following property: smoothing function  $f_{\mu}(x)$  is a good approximation of the original function  $f(x)$ , the error can be bounded by the following lemma.

Lemma 1. Under assumption 1, we can bound the error between gradient of smoothing function  $f_{\mu}(x)$  and the gradient of the original function  $f$  as follows:

$$
\left\| \nabla f _ {\mu} (x) - \nabla f (x) \right\| ^ {2} \leq \frac {\mu^ {2} d ^ {2} \left(L _ {0} ^ {2} + L _ {1} ^ {2} \left\| \nabla f (x) \right\| ^ {2}\right)}{2},
$$

The detailed proof is given in lemma D.1 of Appendix.

Furthermore, the second-order moment of rand estimator can be bounded by the following lemma.

Lemma 2. Under assumption 1, we can bound the second-order moment of the rand estimator  $\nabla f(x)$  as follows:

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {\left\{v \sim U _ {S _ {p}} \right\}} \left[ \left\| \bar {\nabla} f (x) \right\| ^ {2} \right] \leq 2 d \| \nabla f (x) \| ^ {2} + \frac {\mu^ {2} d ^ {2} \left(L _ {0} ^ {2} + L _ {1} ^ {2} \| \nabla f (x) \| ^ {2}\right)}{2},
$$

The detailed proof is given in lemma D.2 of Appendix.

The following lemma demonstrates the Lipschitz continuity (with a slight abuse of terminology) of the minibatch version of the rand estimator. To put it a bit less rigorously, we can say that the Lipschitz constant of the minibatch rand estimator scales as  $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{d}{S}}\right)$ .

Lemma 3. Under assumption 1, the Lipschitz property of the batch estimator  $\overline{\nabla}_S f(x;\xi)$  is given as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| \bar {\nabla} _ {S} f (x _ {1}; \xi) - \bar {\nabla} _ {S} f (x _ {2}; \xi) \right\| ^ {2} \right] \leq 6 \mu^ {2} d ^ {2} L _ {0} ^ {2} + 9 \mu^ {2} d ^ {2} L _ {1} ^ {2} \left\| \nabla f (x _ {1}) \right\| ^ {2} + 3 L _ {0} ^ {2} \left(4 + \frac {d}{S}\right) \left\| x _ {1} - x _ {2} \right\| ^ {2} \\ + \left(1 2 L _ {0} ^ {2} + \frac {3}{2} + \frac {3 d L _ {1} ^ {2}}{S}\right) \| \nabla f (x _ {1}) \| ^ {2} \| x _ {1} - x _ {2} \| ^ {2}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The detailed proof is given in lemma D.5 of Appendix.

Technical Novelty: Compared with the original analysis of zeroth order method under standard smooth, we need to rebuilt new approximate errors under  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth in Lemmas 1-3.

# 3.1.2 COORD ESTIMATOR ANALYSIS UNDER GENERALIZED SMOOTHNESS

Definition 2 (Coord estimator). We define zeroth-order coord gradient estimator  $\hat{\nabla} f(x)$  as follows:

$$
\hat {\nabla} f (x) := \sum_ {\ell = 1} ^ {d} \frac {1}{\mu} [ f (x + \mu \mathbf {e} _ {\ell}) - f (x) ] \mathbf {e} _ {\ell}, \quad (\text {c o o r d e s t i m a t o r})
$$

where  $\mathbf{e}_l$  is a standard basis vector with 1 at its  $l^{th}$  coordinate, and 0s elsewhere. In stochastic case that we can't access to  $f(x)$ , we define the stochastic version of coord estimator in general expectation case and finite sum case:

$$
\hat {\nabla} f (x; \xi) := \sum_ {\ell = 1} ^ {d} \frac {1}{\mu} [ f (x + \mu \mathbf {e} _ {\ell}; \xi) - f (x; \xi) ] \mathbf {e} _ {\ell}, \hat {\nabla} f _ {i} (x) := \sum_ {\ell = 1} ^ {d} \frac {1}{\mu} [ f _ {i} (x + \mu \mathbf {e} _ {\ell}) - f _ {i} (x) ] \mathbf {e} _ {\ell}, \tag {5}
$$

in finitesum case, we define it is easy to verify that  $\mathbb{E}[\hat{\nabla} f(x;\xi)] = \hat{\nabla} f(x)$  and  $\mathbb{E}[\hat{\nabla} f_i(x)] = \hat{\nabla} f(x)$ .

The following lemma provides an upper bound on the error of estimating  $\nabla f(x)$  using  $\hat{\nabla} f(x)$  under generalized-smooth conditions.

Lemma 4. Under assumption 1, the following statement holds

$$
\left\| \hat {\nabla} f (x) - \nabla f (x) \right\| \leq \frac {L _ {0} + L _ {1} \| \nabla f (x) \|}{2} \sqrt {d} \mu .
$$

The detailed proof is given in lemma C.1 of Appendix.

The following lemma will show the generalized lipschitzness property of zeroth-order coord estimator.

Lemma 5. Under assumptions 1 and 2, for  $\| x_1 - x_2 \| \leq \frac{2}{L_1}$ , we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| \hat {\nabla} f (x _ {1}; \xi) - \hat {\nabla} f (x _ {2}; \xi) \right\| ^ {2} \right] \leq 6 \left(1 + L _ {1} ^ {2} \mu^ {2} d ^ {2}\right) \left(L _ {0} ^ {2} + L _ {1} ^ {2} \| \nabla f (x _ {1}) \| ^ {2}\right) \| x _ {1} - x _ {2} \| ^ {2} + 3 L _ {0} ^ {2} \mu^ {2} d ^ {2} \\ + \frac {9}{2} L _ {1} ^ {2} \mu^ {2} d ^ {2} \| \nabla f (x _ {1}) \| ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

The detailed proof is given in lemma C.3 of Appendix.

# 3.2 ALGORITHM DESIGN

Equipped with zeroth-order gradient estimator, our method introduces SPIDER (Fang et al., 2018) and normalized step size into the zeroth-order gradient estimator and proposed zeroth-order normalized gradient method for solving both finite sum and general expectation optimizations. SPIDER is a variance reduction-typed method with optimal complexity guarantee, which uses large batch and small batch alternately to estimate stochastic gradients in a recursive way as follows

$$
\mathbf {v} ^ {k} = \nabla f _ {B} \left(\mathrm {x} ^ {k}\right) - \nabla f _ {B} \left(\mathrm {x} ^ {k - 1}\right) + \mathbf {v} ^ {k - 1}, \quad (\text {S P I D E R})
$$

with clipped step size  $\eta_{k} = \min \{c_{1},\frac{c_{2}\epsilon}{\|v_{k}\|}\}$ , where  $c_{1},c_{2}$  are some constants, and  $\nabla f_B(x) = \frac{1}{|B|}\sum_{\xi \in B}\nabla f(x;\xi)$ . Our method is a combination of SPIDER with normalized step size and zeroth-order gradient estimator, we call it ZONSPIDER, the main idea is to use coord or rand estimator to estimate the gradient of the original function, and use normalized stepsize to update the point  $x$ , the pseudo code is shown in algorithm 1. We compute the gradient estimator  $v_{k}$  by sampling  $B$  zeroth-order gradient estimator when  $\mod (k,q) = 0$ , and use small batch  $b$  to compute the gradient estimator  $v_{k}$  when  $\mod (k,q)\neq 0$ , and later update  $x$  using normalized stepsize  $x_{k + 1} = x_k - \eta_k v_k$ . The main difference between our algorithm and SPIDER is that SPIDER use clipped step-size, while we use a simpler normalized step-size  $\eta_{k} = \frac{c_{2}\epsilon}{\|v_{k}\|}$ , as shown in Table 3.2. To address the additional challenges posed by the  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth condition, we adopt a different analytical approach from SPIDER, which is based on an inexact normalized descent lemma to obtain the decrease in function value (in expectation).

# 3.3 CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS

In this part, we give the convergence analysis of our method, we first introduce the inexact descent lemma, which is the key for our analysis. There are four theoretical results that need to be provided in this paper, we will give the analysis of coord estimator in finite sum (i.e. Theorem1) as an example.

Lemma 6 (inexact descent lemma). Under assumption 1 with  $\eta_k = \frac{c_2\epsilon}{\|v_k\|}$ ,  $c_2 \leq 1$ , and  $x_{k+1} - x_k = -\eta_k v_k$ , we have:

$$
f \left(x _ {k + 1}\right) \leq f \left(x _ {k}\right) - \left(c _ {2} \epsilon - \frac {L _ {1} c _ {2} ^ {2} \epsilon^ {2}}{2}\right) \| \nabla f \left(x _ {k}\right) \| + 2 c _ {2} \epsilon \| v _ {k} - \nabla f \left(x _ {k}\right) \| + \frac {L _ {0} c _ {2} ^ {2} \epsilon^ {2}}{2}. \tag {6}
$$

The detailed proof is given in lemma E.1 of Appendix.

Next, to obtain the convergence rate, we need to estimate the term  $\| v_{k} - \nabla f(x_{k})\|$ , we use the triangle inequality  $\| v_{k} - \nabla f(x_{k})\| \leq \left\| v_{k} - \hat{\nabla} f(x_{k})\right\| +\left\| \hat{\nabla} f(x_{k}) - \nabla f(x_{k})\right\|$ , in lemma C.1 we have obtained the upperbound of  $\left\| \hat{\nabla} f(x_k) - \nabla f(x_k)\right\|$ , next we study the remaining term,  $\| v_{k} - \nabla f(x_{k})\|$ , classical analysis of Sipder(Fang et al., 2018) often use the variance decomposition technique to obtain

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| v _ {k + 1} - \hat {\nabla} f (x _ {k + 1}) \right\| ^ {2} \right] \leq \mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| v _ {k} - \hat {\nabla} f (x _ {k}) \right\| ^ {2} \right] + \frac {1}{b} \mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| \hat {\nabla} f _ {i} (x _ {k + 1}) - \hat {\nabla} f _ {i} (x _ {k}) \right\| ^ {2} \right],
$$

thus summing up the above inequality from  $k = \hat{k}$  to  $k = q - 1$ , we have

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| v _ {k} - \hat {\nabla} f (x _ {k}) \right\| ^ {2} \right] \leq \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {l = \hat {k}} ^ {\hat {k} + q - 1} \mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| \hat {\nabla} f _ {i} (x _ {k + 1}) - \hat {\nabla} f _ {i} (x _ {k}) \right\| ^ {2} \right] + \underbrace {\mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| v _ {\hat {k}} - \hat {\nabla} f (x _ {\hat {k}}) \right\| ^ {2} \right]} _ {= 0 (\mathrm {f i n i t e s u m c a s e})},
$$

in traditional  $L$ -smooth case, choosing parameters to let  $\| x_{k + 1} - x_k\| \leq \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ , and let  $q = b$ , we can easily get upper bound

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| v _ {k} - \hat {\nabla} f (x _ {k}) \right\| ^ {2} \right] \leq \mathcal {O} (\epsilon^ {2}) + \underbrace {\mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| v _ {\hat {k}} - \hat {\nabla} f (x _ {\hat {k}}) \right\| ^ {2} \right]} _ {= 0 (\text {f i n i t e s u m c a s e})} \leq \mathcal {O} (\epsilon^ {2}), \tag {7}
$$

but in  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth zeroth-order optimization, this equation contains additional gradient norms terms as shown in the following lemma.

Lemma 7 (Variance of finite sum case). Under assumptions 1 and 2, for Algorithm 1 with  $\mu \leq \frac{1}{dL_1}$  we have

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \left\| v _ {k} - \hat {\nabla} f (x _ {k}) \right\| \right] \leq 6 L _ {0} c _ {2} \epsilon + 2 L _ {0} d \mu + \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {l = \hat {k}} ^ {k} \left(6 L _ {1} c _ {2} \epsilon + 3 L _ {1} d \mu\right) \| \nabla f (x _ {l}) \|, \tag {8}
$$

The detailed proof is given in lemma E.2 of Appendix.

From the above lemma, the variance term can't be bounded by a constans like equation(7), our strategy is taking (8) into lemma 6, and sum it from  $k = \hat{k}$  to  $k = \hat{k} + q$  (one epoch) to obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} \left[ f \left(x _ {q + \hat {k}}\right) - f \left(x _ {\hat {k}}\right) \right] \leq - \left(c _ {2} \epsilon - \frac {L _ {1} c _ {2} ^ {2} \epsilon^ {2}}{2} - L _ {1} c _ {2} \epsilon \sqrt {d} \mu\right) \sum_ {k = \hat {k}} ^ {q + \hat {k} - 1} \| \nabla f \left(x _ {k}\right) \| \\ + \frac {2 c _ {2} \epsilon}{\sqrt {b}} \sum_ {k = \hat {k}} ^ {\hat {k} + q - 1} \sum_ {l = \hat {k}} ^ {k} \left(4 L _ {1} c _ {2} \epsilon + 3 L _ {1} \sqrt {d} \mu\right) \| \nabla f (x _ {l}) \| + \mathcal {O} (\epsilon^ {2}), \\ \end{array}
$$

a key observation is that in double sum term, every  $\nabla f(x_{l})$  appears at most  $q$  times, this leads to  $\sum_{k = \hat{k}}^{\hat{k} +q}\sum_{l = \hat{k}}^{k}(c_2\epsilon L_1 + 2d\mu L_1)\| \nabla f(x_l)\| \leq q\sum_{l = \hat{k}}^{q}\| \nabla f(x_l)\|$ , and this terms be absorbed by the first term by the choice of parameters, thus we obtain the function value descent in  $q$  iteration:

$$
\mathbb {E} [ f (x _ {q + \hat {k}}) - f (x _ {\hat {k}}) ] \leq - \frac {q c _ {2} \epsilon^ {2}}{4},
$$

this means we derecase the function value by an average of  $\frac{c_2\epsilon^2}{8}$  per iteration(in expectation), thus we need at most  $K = \mathcal{O}(\Delta \epsilon^{-2})$  to find the stationary point, and the total number of oracle calls is

$$
\# f u n t i o n = \mathcal {O} (d) K (b + \frac {B}{q}) = \mathcal {O} (d \epsilon^ {- 2} \sqrt {n}).
$$

The following theorem is a formal statement of the above analysis.

Theorem 1 (Finite sum case(coord estimator)). For Algorithm 1 with coordinate estimator in finite sum case, under assumptions 1 and 2, let  $c_2 \leq \min \left\{ \frac{1}{72L_1}, \frac{1}{68L_0} \right\}$ , choose  $\eta_k = \frac{c_2 \epsilon}{\|v_k\|}$ ,  $\mu \leq \min \left\{ \frac{\epsilon}{40\sqrt{d}L_0}, \frac{1}{56n^{\frac{1}{4}}L_1\sqrt{d}} \right\}$ ,  $q = b = \sqrt{n}$ ,  $B = n$ , we have

$$
\mathbb {E} [ f (x _ {q + \hat {k}}) - f (x _ {\hat {k}}) ] \leq - \frac {q c _ {2} \epsilon^ {2}}{4}.
$$

We state that, in expectation, the function value of  $f$  decreases by an average of  $\frac{c_2\epsilon}{4}$  in, since  $f(x)$  per iteration. Since  $f$  can deacrease at most  $\Delta$ , we need at most

$$
K = \mathcal {O} (\Delta \epsilon^ {- 2} \max \{L _ {1}, L _ {0} \}),
$$

in expectation to find the stationary point, and the total numbers of the function query is

$$
\# f u n c t i o n q u e r y = d T \left(b + \frac {B}{q}\right) = \mathcal {O} \left(d \epsilon^ {- 2} \sqrt {n} \max  \left\{L _ {1}, L _ {0} \right\} + d n\right).
$$

The detailed proof is given in lemma E.1 of Appendix.

We then give the results of other three cases as follows.

Theorem 2 (Expectation case(coord estimator)). For Algorithm 1 with coordinate estimator in expectation case, under assumptions 1 and 2, let  $c_{2} \leq \min \left\{\frac{1}{72L_{1}}, \frac{1}{68L_{0}}\right\}$ , choose  $\eta_{k} = \frac{c_{2}\epsilon}{\|\nu_{k}\|}$ ,  $\mu \leq \min \left\{\frac{\epsilon}{56dL_{0}}, \frac{1}{56L_{1}\sqrt{d\epsilon^{-0.5}}}\right\}$ ,  $B \geq \max \left\{\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_{1}^{2}), \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_{0}^{2})\right\}$ ,  $q = b = \epsilon^{-1}$ , in expectation, we can find the stationary point in  $K = \mathcal{O}(\Delta \epsilon^{-2} \max \{L_{1}, L_{0}\})$ , and the total number of oracle calls #function =  $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-3} \max \{L_{1}, L_{0}\} \max \{\sigma_{0}^{2}, \sigma_{1}^{2}\} + dn\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_{0}^{2})$ . The detailed proof is given in lemma E.2 of Appendix.

Theorem 3 (Finite sum case( rand estimator)). For Algorithm 1 with rand estimator in finite sum case, under assumptions 1 and 2, let  $c_{2}\leq \min \{\frac{1}{8(3L_{1} + 2 + 4L_{0})},\frac{1}{36L_{0}}\}$  , choose  $\eta_{k} = \frac{c_{2}\epsilon}{\|v_{k}\|},$ $\mu \leq \min \{\frac{\epsilon}{40dL_0},\frac{1}{20L_1d}\} ,q = b = \sqrt{n},B = n,$  we need at most  $K = \mathcal{O}(\Delta \epsilon^{-2}\max \{L_1,L_0\})$  in expectation to find the stationary point, and the total number of e function query is #function query  $= dT(b + \frac{B}{q}) = \mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-2}\sqrt{n}\max \{L_1,L_0\} +dn)$  . The detailed proof is given in lemma E.3 of Appendix.

Theorem 4 (Expectation case( rand estimator)). For Algorithm 1 with rand estimator in expectation case, under assumptions 1 and 2, let  $c_{2}\leq \min \{\frac{1}{8(5L_{1} + 2 + 4L_{0})},\frac{1}{36L_{0}}\}$  , choose  $\eta_{k} = \frac{c_{2}\epsilon}{\|v_{k}\|},\mu \leq$ $\min \{\frac{\epsilon}{40dL_0},\frac{1}{20L_1d}\} ,q = b = \epsilon^{-1},B\geq \max \{\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}(3 + \sigma_1)^2),\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_0^2)\} ,$  we need at most  $K = \mathcal{O}(\Delta \epsilon^{-2}\max \{L_1,L_0\})$  in expectation to find the stationary point, and the total number of e function query is #function  $= \mathcal{O}(d)K(b + \frac{B}{q}) = \mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-3}\max \{\sigma_1^2,\sigma_0^2\} \max \{L_1,L_0\} +$ $\epsilon^2\max \{\sigma_1^2,\sigma_0^2\})$  . The detailed proof is given in lemma E.4 of Appendix.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We conduct two experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method: the first experiment focuses on Phase Retrieval, while the second examines Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), as detailed in (Chen et al., 2023). In Phase Retrieval, we first analyze the effects of different parameters of the rand and coord estimators, presented in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). Subsequently, we compare the effectiveness of proposed ZONSPIDER method against other first-order algorithms in both Phase Retrieval and DRO, shown in Figures 1(c) and 1(d). Notably, we use sample complexity to measure the cost; for zeroth-order algorithms, sample complexity refers to the number of zeroth-order gradient estimators utilized.

# 4.1 APPLICATION TO NONCONVEX PHASE RETRIEVAL

Phase retrieval is a well-known nonconvex problem in machine learning and signal processing (Miao et al., 1999). Let  $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$  represent the true underlying object, and assume we collect  $m$  intensity measurements, given by  $y_r = |\mathbf{a}_r^\top x|^2$  for  $r = 1, 2, \ldots, m$ , where  $\mathbf{a}_r \in \mathbb{R}^d$ . The challenge in phase retrieval lies in recovering the signal by solving the associated nonconvex optimization problem:

$$
\min  _ {z \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} f (z) := \frac {1}{2 m} \sum_ {r = 1} ^ {m} \left(y _ {r} - \left| \mathbf {a} _ {r} ^ {\top} z \right| ^ {2}\right) ^ {2}. \tag {10}
$$

The above nonconvex objective function is a high-order polynomial in the high-dimensional space. Therefore, it does not belong to the  $L$ -smooth function class  $\mathcal{L}$ .

We evaluate the performance of our algorithms by applying them to the non-convex phase retrieval problem described in (10). We adopt the same setup as in (Chen et al., 2023), and we refer readers to appendix A for more details about hyper-parameters.

First, to provide insight into the parameters used in the zeroth-order estimator, we compare the effects of different values of  $S$  in the rand estimator, as shown in Figure 1(a). We observe that choosing  $S = d$  negatively impacts the performance of the rand estimator, while  $S = 10d$  and  $S = 50d$  yield similar results. Thus, we believe the ideal range is  $d < S \leq 10d$ . Next, we examine the effects of different smoothing parameters on both the rand and coord estimators, with results presented in Figure 1(b). The smoothing parameter proves to be quite robust, as selecting  $\mu \leq 10^{-3}$  suffices to achieve good performance for both estimators. Finally, we compare the performance of different algorithms in Phase Retrieval, with results displayed in Figure 1(c). We note that (i) ZONSPIDER-coord and SPIDER demonstrate the best performance, and (ii) the coord estimator exhibits more stable performance compared to the rand estimator.

# 4.2 APPLICATION TO DISTRIBUTIONAL ROBUST OPTIMIZATION

Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO) is a widely used framework for training robust models. Under mild conditions, it aims to solve the following problem:

$$
\min  _ {x \in \mathcal {X}, \eta \in \mathbb {R}} L (x, \eta) := \lambda \mathbb {E} \xi \sim P \psi^ {*} \left(\frac {\ell \xi (x) - \eta}{\lambda}\right) + \eta \tag {9}
$$

where  $\psi^{*}$  is the convex conjugate of  $\psi$ , and we refer readerser to appendix A for more details about hyperparameters. We solve the non-convex DRO problem (9) using life expectancy data, which includes 2,413 samples of life expectancy and influencing factors. After preprocessing (e.g., filling missing values, standardizing variables), we use 2,000 samples for training, with features  $x_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{34}$  and target  $y_{i} \in \mathbb{R}$ , we set  $\lambda = 0.01$  and use the  $\chi^2$  divergence for  $\psi^{*}(t) = \frac{1}{4}(t + 2)^{2} - 1$ . The regularized mean square loss function is:  $\ell_{\xi}(w) = \frac{1}{2}(y_{\xi} - x_{\xi}^{\top}w)^{2} + 0.1\sum_{j=1}^{34}\ln(1 + |w^{(j)}|)$ , initialize  $\eta_0 = 0.1$  and  $w_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{34}$  randomly using a Gaussian distribution.

We compare the performance of several algorithms. The results in Figure 1(d) lead to similar conclusions as those from the Phase Retrieval experiment, namely: (i) ZONSPIDER-coord and its first-order variant perform the best, and (ii) the coordinate estimator outperforms the random estimator.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we address the question of whether zeroth-order methods can be safely applied to problems that exhibit  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smoothness. We propose a variance-reduced zeroth-order method called ZONSPIDER, a variant of SPIDER (Fang et al., 2018), which utilizes normalized step sizes and zeroth-order gradient estimators. We provide an analysis of both coordand rand estimators under the finite sum and general expectation cases, showing that the total number of function value queries required to obtain an  $\epsilon$ -stationary point is upper bounded by  $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-2})$  and  $\mathcal{O}(d\epsilon^{-3})$ , respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of zeroth-order methods to  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth problems. A further direction for research is to explore whether zeroth-order methods can be safely applied to additional problems under the  $(L_0,L_1)$ -smooth condition, such as  $PL$ -conditions, strongly convex conditions, and general convex conditions.
