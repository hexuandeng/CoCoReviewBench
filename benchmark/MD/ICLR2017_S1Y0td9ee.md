# ABSTRACT

The Shift Aggregate Extract Network (SAEN) is an architecture for learning representations on social network data. SAEN decomposes input graphs into hierarchies made of multiple strata of objects. Vector representations of each object are learnt by applying shift, aggregate and extract operations on the vector representations of its parts. We propose an algorithm for domain compression which takes advantage of symmetries in hierarchical decompositions to reduce the memory usage and obtain significant speedups. Our method is empirically evaluated on real world social network datasets, outperforming the current state of the art.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Many different problems in various fields of science require the classification of structured data, i.e. collections of objects bond together by some kind of relation. A natural way to represent such structures is through graphs, which are able to encode both the individual objects composing the collection (as vertices) and the relationships between them (as edges). A number of approaches to the graph classification problem has been studied in graph kernel and neural network literature.

Graph kernels decompose input graphs in substructures such as shortest paths (Borgwardt & Kriegel, 2005), graphlets (Shervashidze et al., 2009) or neighborhood subgraph pairs (Costa & De Grave, 2010). The similarity between two graphs is then computed by comparing the respective sets of parts. Methods based on recursive neural networks unfold a neural network over input graphs and learn vector representations of their nodes employing backpropagation though structure (Goller & Kuchler, 1996). Recursive neural networks have been successfully applied to domains such as natural language (Socher et al., 2011) and biology (Vullo & Frasconi, 2004; Baldi & Pollastri, 2003). An advantage of recursive neural networks over graph kernels, is that the vector representations of the input graphs are learnt rather than handcrafted.

Learning on social network data can be considerably hard due to their peculiar structure: as opposed to chemical compounds and parse trees, the structure of social network graphs is highly irregular. Indeed in social networks it is common to have nodes in the same graph whose degree differs by orders of magnitude. This poses a significant challenge for the substructure matching approach used by some graph kernels as the variability in connectivity generates a large number of unique patterns leading to diagonally dominant kernel matrices.

We propose Shift Aggregate Extract Networks (SAEN), a neural network architecture for learning representations of input graphs. SAEN decomposes input graphs into  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchies made of multiple strata of objects. Objects in each stratum are connected by "part-of" relations to the objects to the stratum above.

In case we wish to classify graphs we can use an  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition in which the top stratum contains the graph  $G$  that we want to classify, while the intermediate strata contain subgraphs of  $G$ , subgraphs of subgraphs of  $G$  and so on, until we reach the bottom stratum which contains the vertices  $v$  of  $G$ .

Unlike  $\mathcal{R}$ -convolution relations in kernel methods (which decompose objects into the set of their parts),  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decompositions are deep as they can represent the parts of the parts of an object.

Recursive neural networks associate to the vertices of the input graphs vector representations imposing that they have identical dimensions. Moreover, the propagation follows the edge connectivity and weights are shared over the whole input graph. If we consider that vector representations of nodes (whose number of parents can differ by orders of magnitude) must share the same weights, learning on social network data with recursive neural networks might be nontrivial.

SAEN compensates the limitations of recursive neural networks by adding the following degrees of flexibility:

1. the SAEN computation schema unfolds a neural network over  $\mathcal{H}$ -decompositions instead of the input graph,  
2. SAEN imposes weight sharing and fixed size of the learnt vector representations on a per stratum basis instead of globally.

Indeed SAEN allows to use vector representations of different sizes for different strata of objects (e.g. graphs, subgraphs, subgraphs of subgraphs, edges, vertices etc.) The SAEN schema computes the vector representation of each object by applying shift, aggregate and extract operations on the vector representations of its parts.

Another contribution of this paper is the introduction of a domain compression algorithm, that we use in our experiments to reduce memory usage and runtime. Domain compression collapses objects in the same stratum of an  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition into a compressed one whenever these objects are indistinguishable for the SAEN computation schema. In particular objects made of the same sets of parts are indistinguishable. In order to obtain a lossless compression an  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition we store counts on symmetries adopting some mathematical results from lifted linear programming (Mladenov et al., 2012). The domain compression algorithm is also reminiscent of the work of Sperduti & Starita (1997) in which common substructures of recursive neural networks are collapsed in order to reduce the computational cost.

# 2 SHIFT-AGGREGATE-EXTRACT NEURAL NETWORKS

We propose a neural network architecture that can take as input an undirected attributed graph  $G = (V, E, X)$  where:

-  $V$  is the vertex set,  
-  $E \subseteq V \times V$  is the set of the undirected edges and  
-  $X = \{\mathbf{x}_v\in \mathbb{R}^p\}_{v\in V}$  is the set of the  $p$  -dimensional vertex attributes.

When the input graphs are unattributed we can set the vertex attributes  $\mathbf{x}_v$  to some vertex invariant perhaps node centrality or betweenness.

# 2.1  $\mathcal{H}$ -HIERARCHICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

Graphs are represented with an  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition is a pair  $(\{S_l\}_{l=0}^L, \{\mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}\}_{l=1}^L)$  where:

-  $\{S_l\}_{l=0}^L$  are disjoint sets of objects and the subscript  $l = 0, \ldots, L$  indicates the level of depth of each stratum  $S_l$  in the hierarchical decomposition  $\mathcal{H}$ . While the objects in stratum  $S_0$  are non-decomposable, the objects  $o_i \in S_l \forall l = 1, \ldots, L$  are composite structures made of parts  $o_j \in S_{l-1}$  belonging to the stratum  $S_{l-1}$ .  
-  $\{\mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}\}_{l=1}^{L}$  is a set of  $l$ ,  $\pi$ -parametrized  $\mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}$ -convolution relations (Hausser, 1999), where  $l$  represents the level of depth in the  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition and  $\pi$  is a discrete label from the finite alphabet  $\Pi_{l}$ .

The  $\mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}$ -convolution relation represents that " $o_j$  is part of  $o_i$ ", where  $o_i \in S_l$  is a composite object made of parts  $o_j \in S_{l-1}$ . We have that  $(o_j, o_i) \in \mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}$  iff  $o_j$  is part of  $o_j$ , the set of the parts of  $o_j$  is defined as  $\mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}^{-1}(o_j) = \{o_i | (o_j, o_i) \in \mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}\}$ .

An  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition is an multilevel generalization of  $\mathcal{R}$ -convolution relations, and it can be reduced to an  $\mathcal{R}$ -convolution relation in the particular case in which  $L = 1$ .

# 2.2 SHIFT AGGREGATE EXTRACT SCHEMA FOR LEARNING REPRESENTATIONS

We now propose a the Shift Aggregate Extract (SAE) schema to unfold a neural network architecture over an  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition of a graph  $G = (V, E, X)$ . We shall use the SAEN architecture to learn vector representations for the objects of all the strata  $\{S_l\}_{l=0}^L$ .

A  $d_{l}$ -dimensional representation  $\mathbf{h}_i\in \mathbb{R}^{d_l}$  is associated to the objects  $o_i\in S_l$  of the  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition according to the following formula:

$$
\mathbf {h} _ {i} = \left\{\underbrace f _ {l} \left(\underbrace {\sum_ {\pi \in \Pi_ {l}} \sum_ {o _ {j} \in \mathcal {R} _ {l , \pi} ^ {- 1} (o _ {i})} \underbrace {\left(\mathbf {z} _ {\pi} \otimes \mathbf {h} _ {j}\right)} _ {\text {S h i f t}} ; \Theta_ {l}\right)} _ {\text {A g g r e g a t e}} \right. \quad \text {o t h e r w i s e .} \tag {1}
$$

Where  $f_{l}(\cdot ;\Theta_{l})$ $l = 0,\dots ,L$  are multilayer neural networks with parameters  $\Theta_l$

With respect to the base case (first branch of Eq. 1) we have that each object  $o_i$  in the bottom stratum  $S_0$  is in one-to-one correspondence with the vertices  $v_i \in V$  of the graph that we are decomposing. Indeed the vector representations  $\mathbf{h}_i$  are computed by evaluating  $f_0(\cdot; \Theta_0)$  in correspondence of the vertex attributes  $\mathbf{x}_{v_i} \in X$ .

The recursion step (second branch of Eq. 1) follows the Shift Aggregate Extract (SAE) schema:

- Shift: each part representation  $\mathbf{h}_j \in \mathbb{R}_{l-1}^d$  is remapped into a space  $\mathbb{R}^{|\Pi_l d_{l-1}|}$  made of  $|\Pi_l|$  slots, where each slot has dimension  $d_{l-1}$ . The indicator vector  $\mathbf{z}_{\pi} \in \mathbb{R}^{|\Pi_l|}$  defined as  $z_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } i = \pi \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$  is used to make sure that vector representations  $\mathbf{h}_j$  object parts generated will fall in the same slot only if they were generated by the  $\mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}$ -convolution relations that have the same  $\pi$ -parametrization. This transformation that shifts part representation  $\mathbf{h}_j$  is expressed in Eq. 1 by using the Kronecker product  $\otimes$  between the indicator vector  $\mathbf{z}_{\pi} \in \mathbb{R}^{|\Pi_l|}$  and the vector representation  $\mathbf{h}_j$  of part  $o_j \in S_{l-1}$ .  
- Aggregate: the shifted representations  $(\mathbf{z}_{\pi} \otimes \mathbf{h}_{j})$  of the parts  $o_{j}$  are then aggregated with a sum.  
- Extract: the aggregated representation is then compressed to  $d_{l}$ -dimensional space by a  $\Theta_{l}$ -parametrized nonlinear map  $f_{l}(\cdot, \Theta_{l}) : \mathbb{R}^{|\Pi_{l}d_{l-1}|} \to \mathbb{R}^{d_{l}}$  that we implement with a multilayer neural network.

The SA steps, that we have seen so far, are identical to those used in kernel design when computing the explicit feature of a kernel  $k(x,z)$  derived from a sum  $\sum_{\pi \in \Pi} k_{\pi}(x,z)$  of base kernels  $k_{\pi}(x,z)$ ,  $\pi \in \Pi$ . However while in kernel methods this kind of operation should be used carefully as it increases by a multiplicative factor  $|\Pi|$  the dimensionality of the feature space this is not an issue when using the SAE schema. Indeed during the E step we can reduce the dimensionality using a multilayer neural network.

While learning low dimensional representations during the E step that allows us to stack the multiple strata in the  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition, manually combining these features as done in graph kernel design would certainly be a nontrivial problem.

# 2.3 EXPLOITING SYMMETRIES FOR DOMAIN COMPRESSION

In this section we show how to compress  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decompositions of input graphs exploiting their symmetries. The advantage of compressing the input data is twofold as we save memory and speedup the computation.

We look for symmetries in an  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition collapsing objects from the same stratum  $S_{l}$  that have the identical vector representation. Two objects  $a, b$  in a stratum  $S_{l}$  with represent-

Figure 1: Pictorial representation of the  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition of a graph taken from the IMDB-BINARY dataset (see § 4.1) together with its compressed version.

tations  $\mathbf{h}_a$  and  $\mathbf{h}_b$  are equivalent  $a\sim b$  if they share the same representation  $\mathbf{h}_a = \mathbf{h}_b$  in for all the possible values of  $\Theta_l$ . A compressed stratum  $S_{l}^{comp}$  is the quotient set  $S_{l} / \sim$  of stratum  $S_{l}$  w.r.t.  $\sim$ .

With respect to stratum  $S_0$  two objects  $a$  and  $b$  with attributes  $\mathbf{x}_a$  and  $\mathbf{x}_b$  equivalent  $a \sim b$  if their attributes are identical (i.e.  $\mathbf{x}_a = \mathbf{x}_b$ ) We are considering the case in which  $\mathbf{x}_a$  and  $\mathbf{x}_b$  are vector encodings of discrete labels such as vertex degrees, or other vertex invariants.

With respect to all the other levels  $l = 1, \ldots, L$ , two objects  $a, b \in S_l$  are equivalent  $a \sim b$  if they are made by same sets of parts for all the  $\pi$ -parameterizations of the  $\mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}$ -decomposition relation.

In Figure 1 (on the left) we show the  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition of a graph taken from the IMDB-BINARY dataset (see § 4.1) together together with its compressed version (on the right).

In order to compress  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decompositions we adapt the lifted linear programming technique proposed by Mladenov et al. (2012) to the SAEN architecture. If a matrix  $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$  has  $m \leq n$  distinct rows it can be decomposed as the product  $DM^{comp}$  where  $M^{comp}$  is a compressed version of  $M$  in which the distinct rows of  $M$  appear exactly once and  $D$  is a decompression matrix. The decompression matrix  $D$  encodes the equivalence relation among the rows of  $M$  so that  $D_{ij} = 1$  if the  $i^{th}$  row of  $M$  falls in the equivalence class  $j$  and  $D_{ij} = 0$  otherwise. A pseudo-inverse  $C$  of  $D$  can be computed by the rows of  $D^{\top}$  by their sum (where  $D^{\top}$  is the transpose of  $D$ ).

Example 1 If we look at matrix  $M$  in Eq. 2 we notice that row 1 and 4 share the encoding  $[0,0,0]$ , rows 3 and 5 share the encoding  $[1,1,0]$  while the encoding  $[1,0,1]$  appears only once at row 2. Matrix  $M^{comp}$  is the compressed version of  $M$ .

$$
M = \left[ \begin{array}{l l l} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right] \quad M ^ {c o m p} = \left[ \begin{array}{l l l} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right] \quad D = \left[ \begin{array}{l l l} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] \quad C = \left[ \begin{array}{l l l l l} 1 / _ {2} & 0 & 0 & 1 / _ {2} & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & ^ {1 / _ {2}} & 0 & ^ {1 / _ {2}} \end{array} \right] \tag {2}
$$

Matrix  $M$  can be expressed as the matrix product between the decompression matrix  $D$  and the compressed version of  $M^{comp}$  (i.e.  $M = DM^{comp}$ ), while the matrix multiplication between the compression matrix  $C$  and the  $M$  leads to the compressed matrix  $M^{comp}$  (i.e.  $M^{comp} = CM$ ).

To apply domain compression we rewrite Eq. 1 in matrix form as follows:

$$
H _ {l} = \left\{\underbrace {f _ {0} (X ; \Theta_ {0})} _ {| S _ {0} | \times d _ {0}} \quad \text {i f} l = 0 \right. \tag {3}
$$

Where:

-  $H_{l} \in \mathbb{R}^{|S_{l}| \times d_{l}}$  is the matrix that represents the  $d_{l}$ -dimensional encodings of the objects in  $S_{l}$ . The rows of  $H_{l}$  are the vector representations  $\mathbf{h}_{i}$  in Eq. 1, while the rows of  $H_{l-1}$  are the vector representations  $\mathbf{h}_{j}$  in Eq. 1.  
-  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{|S_0| \times p}$  is the matrix that represents the  $p$ -dimensional encodings of the vertex attributes in  $V$  (i.e. the rows of  $X$  are the  $\mathbf{x}_{v_i}$  of Eq. 1).  
-  $f_{l}(\cdot ;\Theta_{l})$  is unchanged w.r.t. Eq. 1 and is applied to its input matrices row-wise.  
-  $R_{l,\pi} \in \mathbb{R}^{|S_l| \times |S_{l-1}|} \forall \pi \in \Pi_l$  are the matrix representations of the  $\mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}$ -convolution relations of Eq. 1 whose elements are  $(R_{l,\pi})_{ij} = 1$  if  $(o_j, o_i) \in \mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}$  and 0 otherwise.

Domain compression on Eq. 3 is performed by the DOMAIN-COMPRESSION (see Algorithm 2) that takes as input the attribute matrix  $X$  and the part-of matrices  $R_{l,\pi}$  and returns their compressed versions  $X^{comp}$  and the  $R_{l,\pi}^{comp}$  respectively. The algorithm starts by invoking (line 1) the procedure COMPUTE-CD on  $X$  to obtain the compression and decompression matrices  $C_0$  and  $D_0$  respectively. The compression matrix  $C_0$  is used to compress  $X$  (line 2) then we start iterating over the levels  $l = 0, \dots, L$  of the  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition (line 4) and compress the  $R_{l,\pi}$  matrices. The compression of the  $R_{l,\pi}$  matrices is done by right-multiplying them by the decompression matrix  $D_{l - 1}$  of the previous level  $l - 1$  (line 5). In this way we collapse the parts of relation  $\mathcal{R}_{l,\pi}$  (i.e. the columns of  $R_{l,\pi}$ ) as these were identified in stratum  $S_{l - 1}$  as identical objects (i.e. those objects corresponding to the rows of  $X$  or  $R_{l - 1,\pi}$  collapsed during the previous step). The result is a list  $R^{col\_ comp} = [R_{l,\pi}D_{l - 1}, \forall \pi = 1, \dots, |\Pi_l|]$  of column compressed  $R_{l,\pi}$ -matrices. We proceed collapsing equivalent objects in stratum  $S_l$ , i.e. those made of identical sets of parts: we find symmetries in  $R^{col\_ comp}$  by invoking COMPUTE-CD (line 6) and obtain a new pair  $C_l$ ,  $D_l$  of compression, and decompression matrices respectively. Finally the compression matrix  $C_l$  is applied to the column-compressed matrices in  $R^{col\_ comp}$  in order to obtain the  $\Pi_l$  compressed matrices of stratum  $S_l$  (line 8).

Algorithm 2 allows us to compute the domain compressed version of Eq. 3 which can be obtained by replacing:  $X$  with  $X^{comp} = C_0X$ ,  $R_{l,\pi}$  with  $R_{l,\pi}^{comp} = C_lR_{l,\pi}D_{l-1}$  and  $H_l$  with  $H_l^{comp}$ .

Willing to recover the original encodings  $H_{l}$  (perhaps after that we have trained the  $\Theta$ -parameters the domain compressed SAEN architecture) we just need to employ the decompression matrix  $D_{l}$  on the compressed encodings  $H_{l}^{comp}$ . Indeed  $H_{l} = D_{l}H_{l}^{comp}$ .

Equation 3 has been annotated with matrix sizes using the underbrace notation. As we can see by

substituting  $S_{l}$  with  $S_{l}^{comp}$ , the more are the symmetries (i.e. when  $|S_{l}^{comp}| \ll |S_{l}|$ ) the greater the domain compression will be.

# 3 RELATED WORKS

When learning with graph inputs two fundamental design aspects that must be taken into account are: the choice of the pattern generator and the choice of the matching operator. The former decomposes the graph input in substructures while the latter allows to compare the substructures.

Among the patterns considered from the graph kernel literature we have paths, shortest paths, walks (Kashima et al., 2003), subtrees (Ramon & Gartner, 2003; Shervashidze et al., 2011) and neighborhood subgraphs (Costa & De Grave, 2010). The similarity between graphs  $G$  and  $G'$  is computed by counting the number of matches between their common substructures (i.e. a kernel on the sets of the substructures). The match between two substructures can be defined by using graph isomorphism or some other weaker graph invariant.

When the number of substructures to enumerate is infinite or exponential with the size of the graph (perhaps this is the case for random walks and shortest paths respectively) the kernel between the two graphs is computed without generating an explicit feature map. Learning with an implicit feature map is not scalable as it has a space complexity quadratic in the number of training examples (because we need to store in memory the gram matrix).

Other graph kernels such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree Kernel (WLST) (Shervashidze et al., 2011) and the Neighborhood Subgraph Pairwise Distance Kernel (NSPDK) (Costa & De Grave, 2010) deliberately choose a pattern generator that scales polynomially and produces an explicit feature map. However the vector representations produced by WLST and NSPDK are handcrafted and not leant.

A recent work by Yanardag & Vishwanathan (2015) proposes to uses pattern generators such as graphlets, shortest paths and WLST subtrees to transform input graphs into documents. The generated substructures are then treated as words and embedded in the Euclidean space with a CBOW or a Skip-gram model. The deep upgrade of existing graph kernels is performed by reweighing the counts of the substructures by the square root of their word-vector self similarity.

Another recent work by Niepert et al. (2016) upgrades the convolutional neural networks CNNs for images to graphs. While the receptive field of a CNN is usually a square window (Niepert et al., 2016) employ neighborhood subgraphs as receptive fields. As nodes in graphs do not have a specific temporal or spatial order, (Niepert et al., 2016) employ vertex invariants to impose an order on the nodes of the subgraphs/receptive fields.

# 4.2 EXPERIMENTS

In our experiments we chose an  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition called Ego Graph Neural Network (EGNN), that mimics the graph kernel NSPDK with the distance parameter set to 0.

We turn unattributed graphs  $(V,E)$  into attributed graphs  $(V,E,X)$  by annotating their vertices  $v\in V$  with attributes  $\mathbf{x}_v\in X$ . We label vertices  $v$  of  $G$  with their degree and encode this information into the attributes  $\mathbf{x}_v$  by employing the 1-hot encoding.

Attributed graphs  $G = (V, E, X)$  are decomposed by EGNN into a 3 level  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition with the following strata:

- stratum  $S_0$  contains objects  $o_v$  that are in one-to-one correspondence with the vertices  $v \in V$  of  $G$ .  
- stratum  $S_{1}$  contains  $v_{root}$ -rooted  $r$ -neighborhood subgraphs (i.e. ego graphs)  $e = (v_{root}, V_e, E_e)$  of radius  $r = 0, 1$  and has part-of alphabet  $\Pi_{1} = \{\text{ROOT}, \text{ELEM}\}$ . Objects  $o_v \in S_0$  are "ELEM-part-of" ego graph  $e$  if  $v \in V_e \setminus \{v_{root}\}$ , while the are "ROOT-part-of" ego graph  $e$  if  $v = v_{root}$ .  
- stratum  $S_{2}$  contains the graph  $G$  that we want to classify and has part-of alphabet  $\Pi_{2} = \{0,1\}$  which correspond to the radius of the ego graphs  $e \in S_{1}$  of which  $G$  is made of.

E1 We experimented with SAEN applying the EGNN  $\mathcal{H}$ -decomposition on all the datasets. The classification accuracy of SAEN was measured with 10-times 10-fold cross-validation. We manually chose the number of layers and units for each level of the part-of decomposition; the number of epochs was chosen manually for each dataset and we kept the same value for all the 100 runs of the 10-times 10-fold cross-validation.

The mean accuracies and their standard deviations obtained by our method are reported in Table 1, where we compare these results with those obtained by Yanardag & Vishwanathan (2015) and by Niepert et al. (2016).

E2 In Table 2 we show the file sizes of the preprocessed datasets before and after the compression together with the data compression ratio. We also estimate the benefit of the relational compression from a computational time point of view and report the measurement of the runtime for 1 run with and without compression together with the speedup factor.

For the purpose of this experiment, all tests were run on a computer with two 8-cores Intel Xeon E5-2665 processors and 94 GB RAM. Uncompressed datasets which exhausted our server's memory during the test are marked as "OOM" (out of memory) in the table, while those who exceeded the time limit of 100 times the time needed for the uncompressed version are marked as "TO" (timeout).

# 4.3 DISCUSSION

A1 As shown in Table 1, EGO GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK performs consistently better than the other two methods on all the datasets. This confirm that the chosen  $\mathcal{H}$ -hierarchical decomposition is effective is effective on this kind of problems.

A2 The compression algorithm has proven to be effective in improving the computational cost of our method. Most of the datasets improved their runtimes by a factor between 4 and 5 while maintaining the same expressive power. Moreover, experiments on REDDIT-MULTI5K and REDDIT-MULTI12K have only been possible thanks to the size reduction operated by the algorithm as the script exhausted the memory while executing the training step on the uncompressed files.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

We proposed SAEN, a novel architecture for learning vector representations of  $\mathcal{H}$ -decompositions of input graphs. We applied SAEN for graph classification on 6 real world social network datasets, outperforming the current state of the art on 4 of them and obtaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the others. Another important contribution of this paper is the domain compression algorithm which greatly reduces memory usage and allowed us to speedup the training time of a factor between 4 and 5.
