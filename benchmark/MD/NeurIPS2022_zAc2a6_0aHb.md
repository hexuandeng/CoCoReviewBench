# Abstract

This work identifies the existence and cause of a type of posterior collapse that frequently occurs in the Bayesian deep learning practice. For a general linear latent variable model that includes linear variational autoencoders as a special case, we precisely identify the nature of posterior collapse to be the competition between the likelihood and the regularization of the mean due to the prior. Our result also suggests that posterior collapse may be a general problem of learning for deeper architectures and deepens our understanding of Bayesian deep learning.

# 1 Introduction

Bayesian approaches to deep learning have attracted much attention because they allow for a more principled treatment of inference and uncertainty estimation (Mackay, 1992; Neal, 2012; Wang and Yeung, 2020; Jiang and Ahn, 2020; Zhao et al., 2021; Liu, 2021). One long-standing and unresolved problem for the Bayesian deep learning practice is the problem of posterior collapse, where the posterior distribution of the learned latent variables partially completely collapses with the prior (Bowman et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2018; Lucas et al., 2019; Razavi et al., 2019; Kingma et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021). Up to now, there has not been any precise identification of neither the nature nor the cause of the posterior collapse problem. There are two main challenges that prevent our understanding of the problem: (1) posterior collapses mainly occur in deep learning, and the landscape of deep neural networks is hard to understand in general; (2) the use of approximate loss functions such as the evidence lower bound (ELBO) complicates the problem.

Consider a general problem where one wants to model the data distribution  $p(x,y)$  through a latent variable  $z$ , the evidence lower bound (ELBO) reads

$$
\underbrace {\mathbb {E} _ {x} \left[ - \mathbb {E} _ {q (z | x)} \log (p (y | z)) \right]} _ {\ell_ {r e c}} + \underbrace {\mathbb {E} _ {x} \left[ D _ {K L} (q (z | x) \| p (z)) \right]} _ {\ell_ {K L}}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $q$  is the approximate distribution we rely on to approximate the true distribution  $p$ . This loss is more general than the standard ELBO for variational autoencoders (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2013). Meanwhile, it can be seen as the simplest type of loss for a conditional VAE (Sohn et al., 2015), where one aims to model a conditional distribution  $p(y|x)$ . The distribution  $p(z)$  is the prior distribution of the latent variable  $z$  and is often a low-complexity distribution such as a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian. This loss function thus has a clean interpretation as the sum of a prediction accuracy term (the first term  $\ell_{rec}$ ) that encourages better prediction accuracy and a complexity term (the second term  $\ell_{KL}$ ) that encourages a simpler solution. Learning under this loss function proceeds by balancing the prediction error and the model simplicity. Moreover, learning under this loss function has also been used as one of the primary theoretical models in neuroscience (Friston, 2009), and its understanding may also help advance theoretical neuroscience. However, despite the practical and scientific importance of this objection function for Bayesian deep learning, there has been little theoretical analysis of it in the deep learning context. This work provides an in-depth

study of the posterior collapse problem of Eq. (1), when the decoder  $q(y|z)$  and encoder  $q(z|x)$  are each parametrized by a linear model.

Specifically, our contributions include:

1. we find the global minima of a general linear latent variable model that includes the linear VAE as a special case under Objective (1);  
2. we find the precise condition when posterior collapse occurs, where the global minimum is the origin;  
3. we pinpoint the cause of the posterior collapse to be the excessively strong regularization effect on the mean of the latent variables due to the prior.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to pinpoint the cause of the posterior collapse problem.

This work is organized as follows. The next section discusses the previous literature. Section 3 describes the theoretical problem setting. Section 4 presents our main technical results and analyzes them in detail. Section 5 presents numerical examples. The last section concludes this work and points to the remaining open problems.

Approximate Bayesian Deep Learning. Bayesian deep learning in general and VAE training in particular rely heavily on approximate methods such as the ELBO objective. One well-known practical problem is the problem of posterior collapse, where the posterior seems to partially or even entirely coincide with the prior distribution (Bowman et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2018; Lucas et al., 2019; Razavi et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021). Posterior collapse implies that no learning has actually happened and is regarded as one major problem to be solved in the field. Earlier touches on the problem tend to attribute the cause of posterior collapse to the use of approximate methods, namely, to the use of the ELBO (Bowman et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2018; Razavi et al., 2019). Another line of work attributes the posterior collapse to the high capacity of modern neural networks that are often overparametrized (Alemi et al., 2018; Ziyin et al., 2022b). However, Lucas et al. (2019) showed that for a simplified linear model, the ELBO is not the cause of posterior collapse because posterior collapse exists even in the exact posterior. It also immediately implies that the posterior collapse is not due to the high capacity of the models because linear models have a limited learning capacity. However, Lucas et al. (2019) fails to identify the precise cause of the posterior collapse problem due to their reliance on the equivalence of a two-layer linear VAE with the probabilistic PCA. In contrast, our direct approach allows us to perform an in-depth theoretical "ablation" study, which is then used to pinpoint the cause of the collapse. Our results can be seen as a significant extension of the results in Lucas et al. (2019). Our result is also strictly more general and applies to general latent variable models (one example being the conditional VAE (Sohn et al., 2015)). An important implication of our work is that posterior collapses can be a ubiquitous problem for deep-learning-based latent-variable models (not just unique to VAEs) and that they share a common cause.

Linear Networks. It is well-established that the landscape of a deep linear net can be used to understand that of nonlinear networks. For example, even at depth 0, where the linear net is nothing but a linear regressor, linear nets are shown to be relevant for understanding the generalization behavior of modern overparametrized networks (Hastie et al., 2019). Saxe et al. (2013) studied the training dynamics of a two-layer linear network and applied it to understand the dynamics of learning of nonlinear networks. These networks are the same as a linear regression model in terms of expressivity. However, the loss landscape is highly complicated due to the existence of more than one layer, and linear nets are widely believed to approximate the loss landscape of a nonlinear net (Kawaguchi, 2016; Hardt and Ma, 2016; Laurent and Brecht, 2018; Ziyin et al., 2022a). In particular, the landscape of linear nets was studied as early as 1989 in Baldi and Hornik (1989), which proposed the well-known conjecture that all local minima of a deep linear net are global. This conjecture is first proved in Kawaguchi (2016), and extended to other loss functions and deeper depths in Lu and Kawaguchi (2017) and Laurent and Brecht (2018). Our work essentially studies the loss landscape of linear networks. While each encoder and decoder we use consists of a single linear layer, they effectively constitute a two-layer linear network when trained together and have a highly nontrivial landscape.

# 3 Problem Setting

We consider (generalized) variational autoencoders with input space  $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0}$ , latent space  $z \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}$ , and target space  $y \in \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$ . In general,  $y = f(x)$  is an arbitrary function of  $x$ . When the target  $y$  is identical to the input  $x$ , it is reduced to the standard VAE. In the VAE formalism, we assume that there is an intermediate "latent variable"  $z$  that captures the data generation process. In the main text, the encoder and decoder are considered as linear transformations without bias terms, and the learnable bias is treated in Appendix B, which shows that the effect of the bias terms is equivalent to centering both the input and target to be zero-mean  $(x \to x - \mathbb{E}[x], y \to y - \mathbb{E}[y])$ . Incorporating the bias terms thus does not affect the main results. Specifically, the encoder is defined as  $z = W^{\top}x + \epsilon$ , where  $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$  is the noise distribution introduced by the reparameterization trick where the variance matrix  $\Sigma = \mathrm{diag}(\sigma_1^2, \dots, \sigma_{d_1}^2)$  is assumed to be diagonal and independent from  $x$ . The decoder parametrizes the distribution  $p(y|z) = \mathcal{N}(Uz, \eta_{\mathrm{dec}}^2 I)$ , where the variance  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}^2 I$  is to be isotropic and input-independent. In alignment with the standard practice, we also assume the prior distribution of latent variable  $p(z) = \mathcal{N}(0, \eta_{\mathrm{enc}}^2 I)$  is an isotropic normal distribution, and the encoding variances matrix  $\Sigma$  is learned from the data distribution while  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}^2$  is not learnable. Lastly, we weigh the KL term by a coefficient  $\beta$ , which is a common practice in VAE training (Higgins et al., 2016). Hence, the objective of linear VAE reads,

$$
\begin{array}{l} L _ {\mathrm {V A E}} (U, W, \Sigma) (2) \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {x} \left[ - \mathbb {E} _ {q (z | x)} \log (p (y | z)) + \beta D _ {K L} (q (z | x) \| p (z; \eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2})) \right] (3) \\ = \frac {1}{2 \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}} \mathbb {E} _ {x, \epsilon} \left[ \| U (W ^ {\top} x + \epsilon) - y \| ^ {2} + \beta \frac {\eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}} \| W ^ {\top} x \| ^ {2} \right] + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {d _ {1}} \frac {\beta}{2} \left(\frac {\sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}} - 1 - \log \frac {\sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}}\right) (4) \\ = \frac {1}{2 \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {x} \| U W ^ {\top} x - y \| ^ {2} + \operatorname {T r} (U \Sigma U ^ {\top}) + \underbrace {\beta \frac {\eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}} \operatorname {T r} \left(W ^ {\top} A W\right)} _ {\ell_ {\text {m e a n}}} \right] + \underbrace {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {d _ {1}} \frac {\beta}{2} \left(\frac {\sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}} - 1 - \log \frac {\sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}}\right)} _ {\ell_ {\text {v a r}}}, (5) \\ \end{array}
$$

where the data covariance  $A \coloneqq \mathbb{E}_x[xx^\top]$  is assumed to be a full rank matrix. Note that a crucial feature of the KL term is that it decomposes into two terms, one that regularizes the variance of  $z(\ell_{var})$  and another that regularizes the mean of  $z(\ell_{mean})$ . We will see that it is precisely the  $\ell_{mean}$  term that causes the posterior collapse.

Notation. We use  $x, y$  and  $z$  to denote the input variable, latent variable, and target variable, respectively.  $\mathbb{E}_x$  denotes the expectation over the input variable.  $A := \mathbb{E}_x[xx^T]$  is the second moment matrix of the input  $x$ .  $A$  and  $A^{\frac{1}{2}}$  are thus positive semidefinite by definition.  $W$  and  $U$  are learnable linear transformation matrix for linear encoding and decoding process.  $\Sigma$  is the learnable diagonal latent variance matrix for encoder with diagonal entries  $\sigma_i$ .  $\eta_{\mathrm{enc}}$  is the standard deviation of the prior distribution  $p(z)$ .  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  is the standard deviation of decoded samples. A frequently used quantity is the whitened  $x$ :  $\tilde{x} := A^{-\frac{1}{2}}x$ . Furthermore, we define  $Z := \mathbb{E}_{\tilde{x}}[y\tilde{x}^{\top}] = \mathbb{E}_x[yx^{\top}A^{-1/2}]$ . Let  $Z = F\Sigma_ZG^{\top}$  be the singular value decomposition of  $Z$ , where  $F \in \mathbb{R}^{d_2\times d_2}$  and  $G \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0\times d_0}$  are two orthogonal matrices.  $\Psi \in \mathbb{R}^{d_2\times d_0}$  is a rectangular diagonal matrix with  $d^* = \min(d_0,d_2)$  singular values of  $Z$  in the decreasing order, i.e.,  $\zeta_1 \geq \zeta_2 \geq \dots \geq \zeta_{d^*}$ .

# 4 Main Results

This section discusses the main results, whose proofs are presented in Appendix C. While  $\Sigma$  is often a learnable parameter, we first assume that the KL term is sufficiently strong such that  $\sigma_{1} = \dots = \sigma_{d_{1}} \approx \eta_{\mathrm{enc}}$  is close to the prior value. We then compare with the case when it is learnable, and this comparison reveals that an estimizable  $\sigma_{i}$  is not essential to the posterior collapse problem.

# 4.1 General Result

In this section, we prove two results that will be useful for understanding the nature of the VAE training objective and will be useful for us to find the global minimum. We first show that the VAE objective is equivalent to a matrix factorization problem with a special type of regularization.

Proposition 1. Let  $\tilde{x} \coloneqq A^{-\frac{1}{2}}x$ ,  $Z \coloneqq E_{\tilde{x}}[y\tilde{x}^{\top}]$ , and

$$
\left(U ^ {*}, V ^ {*}\right) := \underset {(U, V)} {\arg \min } L (U, V) = \underset {(U, V)} {\arg \min } \| U V ^ {\top} - Z \| _ {F} ^ {2} + \operatorname {T r} \left(U \Sigma U ^ {\top}\right) + \beta \frac {\eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}} \| V \| _ {F} ^ {2}. \tag {6}
$$

Then, the minimizer  $(U^{*},W^{*})$  of  $L_{\mathrm{VAE}}(U,W,\Sigma)$  is  $(U^{*},W^{*}) = (U^{*},A^{-\frac{1}{2}}V^{*})$  when  $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$  is fixed.

Proof sketch. The term  $\ell_{var}$  is irrelevant to finding the optimal  $U^{*}$  and  $V^{*}$  when  $\Sigma$  is fixed. Thus, the relevant objective can be obtained with the change of variables  $\tilde{x} = A^{-\frac{1}{2}}x$ ,  $\square$

This  $L(U,V)$  can be compared with the regularized singular value decomposition problem (Zheng et al., 2018). We see that the first term is the standard matrix factorization objective, while the second and third is a unique regularization effect due to the VAE structure and the ELBO objective. In addition, the term  $\Sigma$  in the second is the strength of the regularization for the norm of  $U$ , and a crucial difference with standard regularized matrix factorization is that  $\Sigma$  is also a learnable matrix.

The next proposition finds, for any fixed  $\Sigma$ , the global minima  $(U^{*},V^{*})$  of Eq. (6). In particular, the learning is characterized by the learning of the singular values of  $U$  and  $V$ .

Proposition 2. The optimal solution  $(U^{*},V^{*})$  of  $\min_{U,V}L(U,V)$  is given by

$$
U ^ {*} = F \Lambda P, \quad V ^ {*} = G \Theta P, \tag {7}
$$

where  $F \in \mathbb{R}^{d_2 \times d_2}$  and  $G \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0 \times d_0}$  are orthogonal matrices derived by the SVD of  $Z$ ,  $P$  is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix in  $\mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_1}$ , and  $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{d_2 \times d_1}$  and  $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0 \times d_1}$  are rectangular diagonal matrices with the diagonal elements

$$
\lambda_ {i} = \sqrt {\max  \left(0 , \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\sigma_ {i} \eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}} \left(\zeta_ {i} - \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \sigma_ {i} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}}\right)\right)}, \quad \theta_ {i} = \sqrt {\max  \left(0 , \frac {\sigma_ {i} \eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}}{\sqrt {\beta} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}} \left(\zeta_ {i} - \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \sigma_ {i} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}}\right)\right)}. \tag {8}
$$

For convention, we let  $\zeta_{i} = 0$  when  $i > d^{*} = \min (d_0,d_2)$

Proof sketch. The variable  $V$  can be represented by  $U$  under the zero gradient condition at the local optimum. Thus, the objective is conditionally reduced to single-variate with respect to  $U$ . The optimal  $U^{*}$  is constructed by its SVD  $U = Q\Lambda P$ , where the optimal  $Q^{*}$  and  $\Lambda^{*}$  can be determined given the SVD of  $Z$ , and  $P$  is left as a free orthogonal matrix.  $V^{*}$  is determined once  $U^{*}$  is obtained.

The readers are recommended to examine the form of the solutions closely. There are a few interesting features of the global minimum. One note that the sign of the term  $\zeta_{i} - \frac{\sqrt{\beta}\sigma_{i}\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}}{\eta_{\mathrm{enc}}}$  is crucial, and can encourage the parameters  $U$  and  $V$  to be low-rank. Recall that  $\sigma_{i}$  is the eigenvalue value of  $ZZ^{\mathrm{T}} = E[y\tilde{x}^{\top}]E[y\tilde{x}^{\top}]^{\top}$ , one can roughly identify  $\sigma_{i}$  as the strength of the alignment between the input  $x$  and the target  $y$ . To see this, consider a simplified scenario where the target  $y = \gamma Mx$  is a linear function of the input, where  $\gamma$  is the overall strength of the signal and  $\|M\| = 1$  is a normalized orientation matrix, then

$$
Z Z ^ {\mathrm {T}} = \gamma^ {2} M ^ {\top} A M, \tag {9}
$$

which is a positive semidefinite matrix. We see that there are two distinctive sources of contribution to the magnitude of the eigenvalues of  $ZZ^{\mathrm{T}}$ . Its eigenvalues are large if either the overall strength  $\gamma$  is large or if the orientation matrix  $M$  aligns well with the covariance of the input feature  $A$ . Additionally, in the case of VAE,  $\gamma M = I$ , and  $ZZ^{\mathrm{T}} = A$  is nothing but the covariance of input features, and  $\zeta_i^2$  are the eigenvalues of  $A$ .

# 4.2 Linear VAE without Learnable  $\Sigma$

We first consider the case where  $\sigma_{i}$  is a constant that is completely determined by the prior:  $\sigma_{i} = \eta_{\mathrm{enc}}$  Formally, we assume  $\sigma_{i} = \eta_{\mathrm{enc}}$  is a constant, which allows us to find a simplified form for the global minimum. The proof follows by simply plugging  $\sigma_{i} = \eta_{\mathrm{enc}}$  into Proposition 2.

Theorem 1. Let  $\sigma_{i} = \eta_{\mathrm{enc}}$  for all  $i$ . Then, the global minimum has

$$
\lambda_ {i} = \sqrt {\max  \left(0 , \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}} \left(\zeta_ {i} - \sqrt {\beta} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}\right)\right)}, \quad \theta_ {i} = \sqrt {\max  \left(0 , \frac {\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}}{\sqrt {\beta} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}} \left(\zeta_ {i} - \sqrt {\beta} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}\right)\right)}. \tag {10}
$$

There are three interesting observations of the global minimum. First of all, it depends crucially on the sign of  $\zeta_{i} - \sqrt{\beta}\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  for all  $i$ . When the sign is negative for some  $i$ , the learned model becomes low-rank. Namely, some of the dimensions collapse with the prior. When the signs are all negative, we have a complete posterior collapse: both  $U$  and  $V$  are identically zero, so the latent variables have a distribution identical to the prior. A complete posterior collapse happens if and only if  $\max_i\zeta_i - \sqrt{\beta}\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}\leq 0$ . A partial posterior collapse happens if there exists  $i$  such that  $\zeta_i^2 -\sqrt{\beta}\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}\leq 0$ . These two conditions give the precise conditions of posterior collapse in this scenario. This implies that having a sufficiently small  $\beta$  will always prevent posterior collapse. The second observation is that the effect of  $\beta$  is identical to that of  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  because  $\sqrt{\beta}$  and  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  always appear together, and so one alternative way to fix posterior collapses that have not been suggested in the field is to use a sufficiently small  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$ . From a Bayesian perspective, the latter method of tuning  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  is better because  $\eta$  comes directly from the (assumed) likelihood  $p(x|\eta)$ . In contrast, the  $\beta$  parameter is only an implementation technique that has obscure meaning in the Bayesian framework. Therefore, using a small  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  can be a fix to the problem that is justified by the Bayesian principle. The third observation is that the condition for posterior collapse is completely independent of the parameter  $\eta_{\mathrm{enc}}$ , which is the desired variance according to the prior  $p(z)$ . This means that under a Gaussian assumption, the prior does not affect the posterior collapse at all.

Lastly, one also notices a potential problem. The eigenvalue of the second layer  $U$  increases with  $\sqrt{\beta}\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$ , while the first layer decreases with  $\sqrt{\beta}\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$ , and so having a too-small  $\beta$  or  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  causes the model to have a very large norm, which can cause a significant problem for both empirical optimization and generalization. This problem is well-known in the studies about the use of  $L_{2}$  regularization in deep learning: suppose we apply weight decay to two different layers of a ReLU net, and decrease the weight decay strength of one layer to zero, then the norm of this layer will tend to infinity, and the norm of the other layer will tend to zero (Mehta et al., 2018). However, in the next section, we will see that this problem is miraculously and automatically solved for VAE when  $\sigma_{i}$  is learnable.

# 4.3 Linear VAE with Learnable  $\Sigma$

Now, we consider the more general case of a learnable  $\Sigma$ . In practice,  $\Sigma$  is often dependent on the input  $x$ . We make the simplification that  $\Sigma$  is just a data-independent estimizable diagonal matrix, which is the common assumption in the related works (Lucas et al., 2019). The following Corollary gives the optimal training objective as a function  $\Sigma$  and is a direct consequence of proposition 2.

Corollary 1.

$$
\min  _ {U, V} L (U, V) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {d _ {1}} \zeta_ {i} ^ {2} - \left(\zeta_ {i} - \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \sigma_ {i} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}}\right) ^ {2} \mathbb {1} _ {\zeta_ {i} > \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \sigma_ {i} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}}} + \sum_ {i = d _ {1} + 1} ^ {d ^ {*}} \zeta_ {i} ^ {2}, \tag {11}
$$

where the indicator  $\mathbb{1}_{f > 0} = 1$  when the corresponding inequality condition  $f > 0$  is true, and  $\mathbb{1}_{f > 0} = 0$  otherwise.

The constant term  $\sum_{i = d_1 + 1}^{d^*}\zeta_i^2$  in Equation (11) only appears when the latent dimension  $d_{1}$  is less than  $d^{*} = \min (d_{1},d_{2})$ . This is the common situation for VAE application. It indicates that the model learns the large eigenvalues and ignores the small eigenvalues. This means that to find the optimal  $\sigma_{i}$  of Eq. (5), one only have to find the global minimum of a reduced objective:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \min  _ {U, W} L _ {\mathrm {V A E}} (U, W, \Sigma) = \min  _ {U, V} \frac {1}{2 \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}} L (U, V) + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {d _ {1}} \frac {\beta}{2} \left(\frac {\sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}} - 1 - \log \frac {\sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}}\right) (12) \\ = \frac {1}{2 \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {d _ {1}} \left[ \underbrace {\zeta_ {i} ^ {2} - \left(\zeta_ {i} - \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \sigma_ {i} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}}\right) ^ {2} \mathbb {1} _ {\zeta_ {i} > \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \sigma_ {i} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}}} + \beta \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2} \left(\frac {\sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}} - 1 - \log \frac {\sigma_ {i} ^ {2}}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} ^ {2}}\right)} _ {:= l _ {i} (\sigma_ {i})} \right] + \text {c o n s t a n t}. (13) \\ \end{array}
$$

The optimal  $\sigma_{i}^{*}$  can thus be obtained by minimizing each  $l_{i}$  independently:

$$
\sigma_ {i} ^ {*} = \underset {\sigma > 0} {\arg \min } l _ {i} (\sigma). \tag {14}
$$

Proposition 3. The optimal  $\sigma_{i}^{*}$  of  $l_{i}(\sigma)$  is

$$
\sigma_ {i} ^ {*} = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c} \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\zeta_ {i}} \eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} & i f \beta \eta_ {d e c} ^ {2} <   \zeta_ {i} ^ {2} \\ \eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} & i f \beta \eta_ {d e c} ^ {2} \geq \zeta_ {i} ^ {2} \end{array} \right. \tag {15}
$$

This proposition gives an explicit expression for  $\sigma_{i}^{*}$ . On the one hand, we see that there is a threshold value for  $\beta$ . If  $\beta$  is sufficiently large,  $\sigma_{i}$  will be identical to the prior value  $\eta_{\mathrm{enc}}$ , in agreement with our assumption in the previous section. On the other hand, the learned variance  $\sigma_{i}^{*}$  is a function of  $\beta$  if  $\beta$  is below a threshold. We will see that this threshold is the necessary and sufficient condition for posterior collapse to happen in a learnable  $\Sigma$  setting. Thus, the learned variance being identical to the prior variance is also a signature of posterior collapse. The following theorem gives the precise form of the global minimum.

Theorem 2. The global minimum of  $L_{\mathrm{VAE}}(U,W,\Sigma)$  is given by

$$
U ^ {*} = F \Lambda P, \quad W ^ {*} = A ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} G \Theta P, \tag {16}
$$

where  $F$  and  $G$  are derived by the SVD of  $Z$ ,  $P$  is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix in  $\mathbb{R}^{d_1\times d_1}$ , and  $\Lambda = \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_{d_1})$  and  $\Theta = \mathrm{diag}(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_{d_1})$  are diagonal matrices such that

$$
\lambda_ {i} = \frac {1}{\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}} \sqrt {\max  \left(0 , \zeta_ {i} ^ {2} - \beta \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}\right)} \tag {17}
$$

$$
\theta_ {i} = \frac {\eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}}}{\zeta_ {i}} \sqrt {\max  \left(0 , \zeta_ {i} ^ {2} - \beta \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}\right)}. \tag {18}
$$

We note that for  $\sigma_{i} = 0$  when  $i > \min (d_0,d_2)$ . The optimal  $\Sigma^{*} = \mathrm{diag}(\sigma_{1}^{*2},\dots,\sigma_{d_{1}}^{*2})$  such that

$$
\sigma_ {i} ^ {*} = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c} \frac {\sqrt {\beta} \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}}}{\zeta_ {i}} \eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} & \beta \eta_ {d e c} ^ {2} <   \zeta_ {i} ^ {2} \\ \eta_ {\mathrm {e n c}} & \beta \eta_ {d e c} ^ {2} \geq \zeta_ {i} ^ {2} \end{array} \right. \tag {19}
$$

Proof. The optimal solution  $U^{*}, W^{*}, \Sigma^{*}$  are obtained by combining proposition 1, 2, and 3.

Comparing with the solution in section 4.2, one notices two things: (a) the conditions for complete or partial posterior collapse remain unchanged, which implies that a learnable latent variance is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively relevant for the posterior collapse problem even though the functional form of the eigenvalues changed; (b) the magnitude of each of the two layers no longer scales with  $\sqrt{\beta}\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$ , and so using a small  $\beta$  or  $\eta$  will not directly cause the model to diverge in terms of norm, which suggests using that making  $\Sigma$  learnable can have the unexpected practical advantage of stabilizing the training.

Additionally, one also notices that  $\beta \eta_{\mathrm{dec}}^2$  has the effect of keeping the learned model low-rank by removing all the eigenvalues of the learned model below it. This can be directly compared with the effect of using a latent dimension smaller than the input dimension:  $d_1 < d_0$ . In the latter case, the smallest  $d_1 - d_0$  singular values are also pruned. There is a difference between the two types of low-rankness: using a large  $\beta \eta_{\mathrm{dec}}^2$  both removes all the singular values below it and shrinks the remaining ones while using a small latent dimension only removes the smaller singular values without affecting the rest. This is similar to the difference between soft thresholding estimation and hard thresholding estimation in statistics (Wasserman, 2013). This suggests that partial posterior collapses are not necessarily undesirable because, during a partial posterior collapse, the latent variable models automatically perform a degree of sparse learning, which is theoretically understood to help denoising the signal and lead to better generalization (Markovsky, 2012). That being said, complete posterior collapse should always be avoided.

Using the optimal  $U^{*},W^{*},\Sigma^{*}$  , the analytical formulation of the minimal  $L_{\mathrm{VAE}}$  can be obtained.

Corollary 2. The minimal value of the objective function  $L_{\mathrm{VAE}}$  is

$$
\min  _ {U, W, \Sigma} L _ {\mathrm {V A E}} (U, W, \Sigma) = \frac {1}{2 \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}} \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {d ^ {*}} \zeta_ {i} ^ {2} - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {d _ {1}} \zeta_ {i} ^ {2} \left(1 + \frac {\beta \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}}{\zeta_ {i} ^ {2}} \left(\log \frac {\beta \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2}}{\zeta_ {i} ^ {2}} - 1\right)\right) \mathbb {1} _ {\beta \eta_ {\mathrm {d e c}} ^ {2} <   \zeta_ {i} ^ {2}} \right]. \tag {20}
$$

# 4.4 Implications

Our main results have implications for both the problem of posterior collapse and the practice of latent variable models in general.

The cause of posterior collapse. One important implication is the identification of the cause of the posterior collapse problem and the potential ways to fix it. Our results suggest that

- A learnable latent variance is not the cause of posterior collapse;  
- Changing the variance of the prior distribution cannot fix or influence the posterior collapse problem;  
- Comparing with the results in Lucas et al. (2019),  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  being learnable or not is also unnecessary for the posterior collapse problem;  
- The values of  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  and  $\beta$  are crucial for the posterior collapse;  
- A sufficiently small  $\beta$  or  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$  can avoid posterior collapse.

Note that the effect of a small  $\beta$  (large  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$ ) weakens the prior (reconstruction) term, and so the cause of the posterior collapse must be the competition between the prior term, which regularizes the complexity of the model, and the likelihood term, which encourages accurate recognition/reconstruction. One results suggest that one can ignore the effect of the  $\ell_{var}$  term in studying the mechanism of posterior collapse. Ignoring the  $\ell_{var}$  Eq. 5, one sees that the posterior collapse is caused by the competition between the likelihood and  $\ell_{mean}$ , which is precisely the regularization effect on the mean of  $z$ .

There is an interesting alternative perspective on the nature of the posterior from the viewpoint of the architecture geometry. The following theorem states that the origin (where all parameters are zero) is either a saddle or the global minimum for this problem. Since we have shown that  $\sigma_{i}$  does not affect the collapse, we simply let  $\sigma_{i} = \eta_{\mathrm{enc}}$  as in Section 4.2.

Theorem 3. The Hessian of Eq. 5 at 0 is positive semidefinite if and only if it is the global minimum.

The surprising aspect is that for the latent variable model, there is no intermediate case where the origin is a local minimum but not global. Therefore, the origin is, in fact, a very special point in the landscape of a latent variable model, in the sense that a key global property of the landscape (namely, the global minimum) is determined by the local geometry of the model at the origin. Noting that our model can be seen as a direct generalization of the Bayesian linear regression to a deeper architecture, it also becomes reasonable to suspect that the posterior collapse problem is a unique problem of deep learning because the standard Bayesian linear regression does not suffer posterior collapse because the origin can never be a local maximum of the posterior (Bishop and Nasrabadi, 2006). Dai et al. (2020) also finds the origin to be a very special point in a general deep nonlinear VAE structure, and that it can be a local minimum under various settings. However, the implication of our work is broader. The origin is not only a special point for the autoencoding model families, but can actually be a special point for a very broad of model classes (namely, the model class of general latent variable models). The problem of posterior collapse is thus not limited to autoencoders, but can also be relevant to the common regression and classification tasks.

Insights for latent variable model practices. While we have primarily focused on discussing the phenomena of posterior collapse, our results also shed light on latent variable models (including VAE) in practice when there is no complete posterior collapse. Specifically, our results suggest that

- latent variable models perform sparse learning through soft thresholding or hard thresholding or both;  
- thus, partial posterior collapse may actually be desirable;  
- making the latent variance learnable can help stabilize training and avoid divergence of model parameters;  
- the effect of increasing  $\beta$  is identical to the effect of decreasing  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$ .

# 5 Numerical Examples

This section empirically examines our theoretical claims for linear models and demonstrates that our key theoretical insights generalize well to nonlinear models and natural data.

Problem Setting. We illustrate our results on both synthetic data and natural data. For synthetic data, we sample input data  $x$  from multivariate normal distribution  $\mathcal{N}(0,A)$ , and target data  $y = Mx$  is obtained by a linear transformation. Specifically, we choose  $d_0 = d_2 = 5$ . As an example of natural data, we also experiment on the standard MNIST data. Following common practices, we choose  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}} = \eta_{\mathrm{enc}} = 1$ . For non-linear VAE models, we consider two-layer fully connected neural networks for the encoder and decoder with both ReLU and Tanh acitvation functions and with hidden dimension  $d_h$ . For synthetic dataset  $d_h = 8$ , and  $d_h = 2048$  for real-world data. In contrast to our assumption that the variances  $\Sigma$  of encoded  $z$  are independent from the input  $x$ , we parameterize the variance of each encoded  $z$  by a linear transformation or a two-layer neural network, i.e.,  $\Sigma(x) = [\mathrm{Linear} / \mathrm{MLP}](x)$ . This data-dependent modeling is closer to the common practice and the comparison can justify the correctness of our theory. The model is optimized by

Adam with learning rate  $1e - 3$ . The results are reported after the convergence. For MNIST, the learning rate is  $1e - 4$ .  
Results. Linear models are found to agree precisely with the theoretical results, and so we only present the results in the appendix. We focus on exploring the nonlinear models in the main text. We first consider a simple regression task with MLP encoder and decoders with the ReLU activation (Figure 1). Here, we see that the theoretical prediction of loss function  $L_{\mathrm{VAE}}$  agrees well with empirical observation. Moreover, the threshold of complete posterior collapse is also perfectly predicted. For completeness, we also present the case when (1) the activation is Tanh in Appendix A.1. We note that the results are similar. The observation is similar to the standard MNIST dataset with a nonlinear encoder and decoder. See Figure 2.  
For illustration, we also present the generated MNIST images by non-linear  $\beta$ -VAE trained with different choices of  $\beta$  in Figure 3. The latent dimension is 5 as described before. When there are 5 non-collapsed modes, the generated images are both sharp and contain meaningful variations. As the number of remaining non-collapsed modes reduces to zero, we see that the generated images become increasingly blurred and the variation between the data also diminishes. When the model completely collapses, the model outputs a constant, as the theory suggests. Moreover, we note that the values of  $\beta$  are chosen according to the theoretical thresholds for each mode to collapse, i.e., the top-5  $\zeta_{i}$  are [5.12, 3.74, 3.25, 2.84, 2.57]. We see that the theoretical thresholds provide good predictive power for the behavior of mode collapse qualitatively.

# 6 Outlook

In this work, we have tackled the problem of posterior collapse from a theoretical point of view. Our work also contributes to the fundamental theory of deep learning. The linear VAE architecture can be seen as a deep linear model with two layers, whose loss landscape is highly nontrivial. In this perspective, our results advance those results in Ziyin et al. (2022a), where the dimension of the output space is limited to 1d. The limitation of our work is obvious: our theory only deals with linear models, and it is unclear to extent the result carries over to the nonlinear case. Does a nonlinear VAE always experience posterior collapse when  $\beta$  is large enough? If not, what is the precise condition that posterior collapse can happen? Moreover, can we design a Bayesian-principled method for avoiding posterior collapse that does not involve hand-tuning  $\beta$  or  $\eta_{\mathrm{dec}}$ ? These are the remaining open questions whose solutions can help us design principled methods that prevent posterior collapse once and for all and deepen our understanding of how deep learning works.
