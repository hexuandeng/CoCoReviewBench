# ABSTRACT

Extrapolation in graph classification/regression remains an underexplored area of an otherwise rapidly developing field. Our work contributes to a growing literature by providing the first systematic counterfactual modeling framework for extrapolations in graph classification/regression tasks. To show that extrapolation from a single training environment is possible, we develop a connection between certain extrapolation tasks on graph sizes and Lovász's characterization of graph limits. For these extrapolations, standard graph neural networks (GNNs) will fail, while classifiers using induced homomorphism densities succeed, but mostly on unattributed graphs. Generalizing these density features through a GNN subgraph decomposition allows them to also succeed in more complex attributed graph extrapolation tasks. Finally, our experiments validate our theoretical results and showcase some shortcomings of common (interpolation) methods in the literature.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In some graph classification and regression applications, the graphs themselves are representations of a natural process rather than the true state of the process. Molecular graphs are built from a pairwise atom distance matrix by keeping edges whose distance is below a certain threshold and the choice impacts distinguishability between molecules (Klicpera et al., 2020). Functional brain connectomes are derived from time series but researchers must choose a frequency range for the signals, which affects resulting graph structure (De Domenico et al., 2016). Recent work (e.g. Knyazev et al. (2019); Bouritsas et al. (2020); Xu et al. (2020)) explore extrapolations in real-world tasks, showcasing a growing interest in the underexplored topic of graph extrapolation tasks.

In this work we refer to graph-processing environment (or just environment) as the collection of heuristics and other data curation processes that gave us the observed graph from the true state of the process under consideration. The true state alone defines the target variable. Our work is interested in what we refer as the graph extrapolation task: predict a target variable from a graph regardless of its environment. In this context, even graph sizes can be determined by the environment. Unsurprisingly, graph extrapolation tasks—a type of out-of-distribution prediction—are only feasible when we make assumptions about these environments.

We define the graph extrapolation task as a counterfactual inference task that requires learning environment-invariant (E-invariant) representations. Unfortunately, graph datasets largely contain a single environment, while common E-invariant representation methods require training data from multiple environments, including Independence of causal mechanism (ICM) methods (Bengio et al., 2019; Besserve et al., 2018; Johansson et al., 2016; Louizos et al., 2017; Raj et al., 2020; Schölkopf, 2019), Causal Discovery from Change (CDC) methods (Tian & Pearl, 2001), and representation disentanglement methods (Bengio et al., 2019; Goudet et al., 2017; Locatello et al., 2019).

Contributions. Our work contributes to a growing literature by providing, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic counterfactual modeling framework for extrapolations in graph classification/regression tasks. Existing work, e.g., the parallel work of Xu et al. (2020), define extrapolations geometrically which, while interesting, have a different scope. Our work connects Lovász's graph limit theory with graph-size extrapolation in a family of graph classification and regression tasks. Moreover, existing graph classification/regression methods -including graph neural networks and graph kernels- are generally evaluated on generalization error, which effectively tests only how

well they interpolate the training data. We provide a systematic evaluation of these interpolation methods on verifiable extrapolation tasks.

# 2 A FAMILY OF GRAPH EXTRAPOLATION TASKS

Geometrically, extrapolation can be thought as reasoning beyond a convex hull of a set of training points (Hastie et al., 2012; Haffner, 2002; King & Zeng, 2006; Xu et al., 2020). However, for neural networks—and their arbitrary representation mappings—this geometric interpretation is insufficient to describe a truly broad range of tasks. Rather, extrapolations are better described through counterfactual reasoning (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974; Pearl, 2009; Scholkopf, 2019). Specifically we want to ask: After seeing training data from environment  $A$ , how to extrapolate and predict what would have been the model predictions of a test example from an unknown environment  $B$ , had the training data also been from  $B$ . For instance, what would have been the model predictions for a large test example graph if our training data had also been large graphs rather than small ones?

A structural causal model for graph classification and regression tasks. In many applications, graphs are simply representations of a natural process rather than the true state of the process. In what follows we assume all graphs are simple, meaning all pairs of vertices have at most one edge. Our work defines an  $n$ -vertex attributed graph as a sample of a random variable  $\mathcal{G}_n \coloneqq (X_{1,1}^{(\mathrm{obs})},\ldots ,X_{n,n}^{(\mathrm{obs})})$ , where  $X_{i,j}^{(\mathrm{obs})}\in \Omega^{(\mathrm{e})}$  encodes edges and edge attributes and  $X_{i,i}^{(\mathrm{obs})}\in \Omega^{(\mathrm{v})}$  encodes vertex attributes; we will assume  $\Omega = \Omega^{(\mathrm{v})} = \Omega^{(\mathrm{e})}$  for simplicity. Consider a supervised task over a graph input  $G_{n}(n\geq 2)$  and its corresponding output  $Y$ . We describe the graph and target generation process with the help of a structural causal model (SCM) (Pearl, 2009, Definition 7.1.1).

We first consider a hidden random variable  $E \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$  that describes the graph-processing environment. We also consider an independent hidden random variable  $W$  over some arbitrary domain that defines functional topological and attribute characteristics of the graph that are independent of the environment variable  $E$ . In the SCM, these two variables are inputs to a deterministic graph-generation function  $g: \mathbb{Z}^{+} \times \mathbb{D} \times \mathbb{D} \to \Omega^{n \times n}$  that outputs

$$
\mathcal {G} _ {N ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})}} ^ {(\mathrm {h i d})} := \left(X _ {1, 1} ^ {(\mathrm {h i d})}, \dots , X _ {N ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})}, N ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})}} ^ {(\mathrm {h i d})}\right) = g _ {E} (W, Z _ {X}), \text {w i t h} N ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})} := \eta (E, W), \tag {1}
$$

where  $Z_{X}$  is another independent random variable that defines external noise (likely measurement noise of a device). Equation (1) gives edge and vertex attributes of the graph  $\mathcal{G}_{N(\mathrm{obs})}^{\mathrm{(hid)}}$  in some canonical order, where  $\eta$  is a function of both  $E$  and  $W$  that gives the number of vertices in the graph. To understand our definitions, consider the following simple example (divided into two parts).

Erdős-Renyi example (part 1): For a single environment  $e$ , let  $n = \eta(e)$  be the (fixed) number of vertices of the graphs in our training data, and  $p = W$  be the probability that any two vertices of the graph have an edge. Finally, the variable  $Z_{X}$  can be thought as the seed of a random number generator that is drawn  $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$  times to determine if two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. The above defines our training data as a set of Erdős-Renyi random graphs of size  $n$  with  $p = W$ .

The data generation process in Equation (1) could leak information about  $W$  through the vertex ids (the order of the vertices). Rather than restricting how  $W$  acts on  $(X_{1,1}^{(\mathrm{hid})},\ldots ,X_{N(\mathrm{obs}),N(\mathrm{obs})}^{(\mathrm{hid})})$ , we

remedy this by adding a random permutation to the vertex indices.

$$
\mathcal {G} _ {N ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})}} ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})} := \left(X _ {1, 1} ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})}, \dots , X _ {N ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})}, N ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})}} ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})}\right) = \left(X _ {\pi (1), \pi (1)} ^ {(\mathrm {h i d})}, \dots , X _ {\pi (N ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})}), \pi (N ^ {(\mathrm {o b s})})} ^ {(\mathrm {h i d})}\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $\pi \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(\mathbb{S}_{N^{(\mathrm{obs})}})$  is an uniform permutation of the indices  $\{1,\dots ,N^{(\mathrm{obs})}\}$  and  $\mathbb{S}_{N^{(\mathrm{obs})}}$  is the permutation group. The observed graph is the outcome of this joint permutation of vertex ids.

SCM target variable. We now define our target variable  $Y$ . The true target of  $\mathcal{G}_{N^{(\mathrm{obs})}}^{\mathrm{(obs)}}$  is

$$
Y = h \left(W, Z _ {Y}\right), \tag {3}
$$

which is given by a deterministic function  $h(\cdot)$  that depends only on  $W$  and a random noise  $Z_{y}$  independent of  $W$  and  $E$ . Our final structural causal model is summarized in the DAG of Figure 1(a).

Erdős-Rényi example (part 2): The targets of the Erdős-Rényi graphs in our previous example can be, for instance, the value  $Y = W$  in Equation (3), which is also the edge probability  $p$ .

Graph extrapolation tasks over new environments. Equation (3) shows that our target variable  $Y$  is a function only of  $W$ , the functional characteristics of the graph, rather than the graph-processing environment  $E$ . Due to the reverse path between  $Y$  and  $E$  through  $\mathcal{G}_{N(\mathrm{obs})}^{\mathrm{(obs)}}$  in the DAG of Figure 1(a),  $Y$  is not independent of  $E$  given  $\mathcal{G}_{N(\mathrm{obs})}^{\mathrm{(obs)}}$ . These non-causal paths are called backdoor paths since they flow backwards from  $Y$  and  $\mathcal{G}_{N(\mathrm{obs})}^{\mathrm{(obs)}}$ . Hence, traditional (interpolation) methods can pick-up this correlation, which prevents the learnt model from extrapolating over environments different than the ones provided in the training data (or even over different  $P(E)$  distributions).

To address the challenge of predicting  $Y$  with backdoor paths, we need a backdoor adjustment (Pearl, 2009, Theorem 3.3.2). Instead of explicitly conditioning on the environment, we seek a graph representation that allows us to fulfill the backdoor adjustment for the SCM in Figure 1(a), as we will show in Proposition 1. Before we proceed, we note that the existing counterfactual notation in the literature (see Definition 7 of Baireinboim et al. (2020)) could be ambiguous in our setting. Hence, we re-propose the powerful concept of random variable coupling from Markov chains (Pitman, 1976; Propp & Wilson, 1996) to describe our counterfactual inference problem:

Definition 1 (Counterfactual coupling (CFC)). A counterfactual coupling of Equations (1) to (3) is

$$
\begin{array}{l} P (Y = y, \mathcal {G} _ {N ^ {(o b s)}} ^ {(o b s)} = G _ {n ^ {(o b s)}} ^ {(o b s)}, \mathcal {G} _ {N ^ {(c f)}} ^ {(c f)} = G _ {n ^ {(c f)}} ^ {(c f)}) \\ = \mathbb {E} _ {W, Z _ {X}, Z _ {Y}, \pi , E, \tilde {E}} \left[ \mathbb {1} \{y = h (W, Z _ {Y}) \} \cdot \mathbb {1} \{G _ {n ^ {(o b s)}} ^ {(o b s)} = \pi \left(g _ {E} (W, Z _ {X})\right) \} \right. \tag {4} \\ \left. \cdot \mathbb {1} \left\{G _ {n ^ {(c f)}} ^ {(c f)} = \pi \left(g \left(\tilde {E}, W, Z _ {X}\right)\right) \right\} \cdot \mathbb {1} \left\{n ^ {(o b s)} = \eta (E, W) \right\} \cdot \mathbb {1} \left\{n ^ {(c f)} = \eta (\tilde {E}, W) \right\} \right], \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathcal{G}_{N(obs)}^{(obs)}\coloneqq (X_{1,1}^{(obs)},\ldots ,X_{N(obs),N(obs)}^{(obs)})$  and  $\mathcal{G}_{N(cf)}^{(cf)}\coloneqq (X_{1,1}^{(cf)},\ldots ,X_{N(cf),N(cf)}^{(cf)})$ ,  $\pi (\cdot)$  is defined below, and  $E$  and  $\tilde{E}$  are independent random variables that sample environments, potentially with different distributions and supports, and  $\mathbb{1}$  is the Dirac delta function. The counterfactual coupled variable  $\mathcal{G}_{N(cf)}^{(cf)}$  asks what would have happened to  $\mathcal{G}_{N(obs)}^{(obs)}$  if we had used the environment random variable  $\tilde{E}$  in place of  $E$  in Equation (1). In an abuse of notation we have defined  $\pi (G_N^{(\cdot)})\coloneqq (X_{\pi (1),\pi (1)}^{(\cdot)},\dots ,X_{\pi (N),\pi (N)}^{(\cdot)})$  above.

Using Definition 1 we now prove that a graph representation function  $\Gamma(\cdot)$  that is E-invariant encodes a backdoor adjustment between  $\mathcal{G}_{N^{(\mathrm{obs})}}^{\mathrm{(obs)}}, N^{\mathrm{(obs)}}, E,$  and  $Y$ .

Proposition 1. Let  $P(Y|\mathcal{G}_{N^{(obs)}}^{(obs)}) = G_{n^{(obs)}}^{(obs)}$  and  $P(Y|\mathcal{G}_{N^{(cf)}}^{(cf)}) = G_{n^{(cf)}}^{(cf)}$  be the conditional target distributions defined by the counterfactually-coupled random variables in Definition 1. For simplicity, assume  $Y \in \mathcal{Y}$  is discrete. Consider a permutation-invariant graph representation  $\Gamma : \cup_{n=1}^{\infty} \Omega^{n \times n} \to \mathbb{R}^d$ ,  $d \geq 1$ , and a link function  $\rho(\cdot, \cdot)$  such that, for some  $\epsilon, \delta > 0$ , the generalization (interpolation) error is defined as

$$
P \left(\left| P (Y = y \mid \mathcal {G} _ {N ^ {(o b s)}} ^ {(o b s)} = G _ {n ^ {(o b s)}} ^ {(o b s)}\right) - \rho (y, \Gamma \left(G _ {n ^ {(o b s)}} ^ {(o b s)}\right)) \mid \leq \epsilon\right) \geq 1 - \delta , \quad \forall y \in \mathcal {Y},
$$

and  $\Gamma$  is said environment-invariant (E-invariant) if  $\Gamma(\mathcal{G}_{N^{(obs)}}^{(obs)}) \stackrel{a.s.}{=} \Gamma(\mathcal{G}_{N^{(cf)}}^{(cf)})$ , where a.s. (almost surely) means  $\Gamma(G_{n^{(obs)}}^{(obs)}) = \Gamma(G_{n^{(cf)}}^{(cf)})$  for any graphs  $G_{n^{(obs)}}^{(obs)}$  and  $G_{n^{(cf)}}^{(cf)}$  that can be sampled. Then, the extrapolation error is

$$
P \left(\left| P (Y = y \mid \mathcal {G} _ {N ^ {(c f)}} ^ {(c f)} = G _ {n ^ {(c f)}} ^ {(c f)}) - \rho (y, \Gamma \left(G _ {n ^ {(c f)}} ^ {(c f)}\right)) \right| \leq \epsilon\right) \geq 1 - \delta , \quad \forall y \in \mathcal {Y}. \tag {5}
$$

Proposition 1 shows that an E-invariant representation will perform no worse on the counterfactual test data (extrapolation samples from  $(Y, \mathcal{G}_{N^{(\mathrm{ct})}}^{\mathrm{(cf)}})$ ) than on a test dataset having the same environment distribution as the training data (samples from  $(Y, \mathcal{G}_{N^{(\mathrm{obs})}}^{\mathrm{(obs)}})$ ). Other notions of E-invariant representations are possible (Arjovsky et al., 2019; Scholkopf, 2019), but ours —through coupling— provides a direct relationship with how we learn graph representations from a single training environment. Our task now becomes finding an  $E$ -invariant graph representation  $\Gamma$  that generalizes (interpolates) well over the training data distribution.

In recent years, a crop of interesting research has analyzed the expressiveness of  $\Gamma$ . In what follows we explain why these are related to interpolations rather than extrapolations.

A comment on most-expressive graph representations, interpolations, and extrapolations. The expressiveness of a graph classification/regression method is a measure of model family bias (Morris et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018a; Gartner et al., 2003; Maron et al., 2019a; Murphy et al., 2019b). That is, given enough training data, a neural network from a more expressive family can achieve smaller generalization error (interpolation error) than a neural network from a less expressive family, assuming appropriate optimization. However, this power is just a measure of interpolation capability, not extrapolation. Figure 1(b) illustrates a space where each point is a set of neural network parameters from a most-expressive model family. The blue region (ellipsoid  $i$ ) represents models that can perfectly interpolate over the training distribution (i.e., models with the smallest generalization error). The models in the blue region are mostly fitting spurious training environment  $E$  correlations with  $Y$ , that will cause poor extrapolations in new environments.

The models illustrated in the red region of Figure 1(b) (ellipsoid  $ii$ ) are E-invariant and, thus, by Proposition 1, can extrapolate across environments, since they cannot fit these spurious environment correlations. The intersection between the blue and red regions contains models that are optimal both for test data from the same environment distribution as training (interpolation test) and test data from a different environment distribution (extrapolation test). In our SCM in Equations (1) to (3), the intersection between the blue and red ellipsoids is nonempty. We can denote the models in the red ellipsoid as the most-expressive family of  $E$ -invariant (Proposition 1). Our work focuses on a family of classifiers and regression models that reside inside the red ellipsoid.

Summary. In this section we have defined a family of extrapolation tasks for graph classification and regression using counterfactual modelling, and connected it to the existing literature. Next, we show how these definitions can be applied to a family of random graph models (graphons) first introduced by Diaconis & Freedman (1981).

# 3 GRAPH SIZE EXTRAPOLATIONS AND GRAPHONS

Graph datasets are special in that their characteristics can be stable as their size grows (measured in number of vertices). We propose a neural network representation that can be E-invariant given only one environment in training by making use of graphon concentration inequalities. We start with Theorem 1 which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for using these inequalities.

Theorem 1. Assume our graph-processing heuristic gives the number of vertices as  $N^{(obs)} = \eta(E)$  and the outputs of  $g_{e_1}$  and  $g_{e_2}$  of Equation (1) can only differ in their attributes  $\forall e_1, e_2$ . Let  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{(obs)}|W \coloneqq \mathbb{E}_E[\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{(obs)}|W, N^{(obs)} = n, E]$  be the  $n$ -vertex graph output of our graph-processing heuristic over the true underlying data variable  $W$ . If  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{(obs)}|W$  satisfies the following properties:

1. Deleting a random vertex  $n$  from  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{(obs)}|W$ , and the distribution of the trimmed graph is the same as the distribution of  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_{n - 1}^{(obs)}|W$ , with  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_1^{(obs)}|W$  as a trivial graph with a single vertex for all  $W$ .  
2. For every  $1 < k < n$ , the subgraphs of  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{(obs)}|W$  induced by  $\{1,\dots ,k\}$  and  $\{k + 1,\ldots ,n\}$  are independent random variables.

Then, the variable  $W$  can be equivalently defined as  $W = (W', C_E')$ , where  $W'$  is a random variable defined over the family of symmetric measurable functions  $W': [0,1]^2 \to [0,1]$ , i.e.,  $W'$  is a random graphon function, and, if the graph has attributes,  $C_E'$  is an environment-dependent random variable that defines vertex and edge attributes, otherwise,  $C_E' = \emptyset$  is defined as the constant null.

Under the conditions posed in Theorem 1, it is possible to guarantee that a graph representation is E-invariant even when the training data contains just one environment. Then, by Proposition 1, we

can obtain a model with extrapolation power (assuming the target is independent of  $E$ ) by passing the E-invariant learnt representation to a downstream classifier such as a neural network or logistic regression. We investigate ways to achieve E-invariance for unattributed and attributed graphs.

# 3.1 EXTRAPOLATIONS FOR UNATTRIBUTED GRAPHS

We now define an E-invariant graph representation function  $\Gamma$  for all unattributed graph models satisfying the conditions in Theorem 1. Let  $F_{k}$  be an arbitrary  $k$ -vertex unattributed graph, and  $\mathrm{inj}(F,G)$  be the number of injective homomorphisms of  $F$  into a larger unattributed graph  $G$ , informally, the number of copies of  $F$  in  $G$  where we match the edges of  $F$  into  $G$  but not the nonedges. The injective homomorphism density over the  $n$ -vertex graph  $G_{n}$ ,  $n > k$  is defined as:

$$
t _ {\text {i n j}} \left(F _ {k}, G _ {n}\right) = \frac {\operatorname {i n j} \left(F _ {k} , G _ {n}\right)}{n ! / (n - k) !}. \tag {6}
$$

The following is a simple but effective representation (feature vector) of  $G_{n}$ . Let  $\mathcal{F}_{\leq k}$  denote a totally ordered set (w.l.o.g.) of all possible  $k'$ -vertex graphs  $(1 \leq k' \leq k)$  and  $\mathbf{1}_{\text{one-hot}}\{F_{k'}, \mathcal{F}_{\leq k}\}$  be the one-hot vector with a one at the index of  $F_{k'}$  in  $\mathcal{F}_{\leq k}$  and zeros elsewhere. The representation

$$
\Gamma_ {1 - \text {h o t}} \left(G _ {n}\right) = \sum_ {F _ {k ^ {\prime}} \in \mathcal {F} _ {\leq k}} t _ {\text {i n j}} \left(F _ {k ^ {\prime}}, G _ {n}\right) \mathbf {1} _ {\text {o n e - h o t}} \left\{F _ {k ^ {\prime}}, \mathcal {F} _ {\leq k} \right\}, \tag {7}
$$

is a vector containing the densities of each type of  $k'$ -sized ( $k' \leq k$ ) graph in  $G_{n}$ . The following theorem shows the ability of  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}(\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{\text{(obs)}}|W)$  to be an approximately E-invariant representation in a training dataset with input graphs  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{\text{(obs)}}|W$  as given in Theorem 1:

Theorem 2. Let  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{(obs)}|W$  and  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_{n'}^{(obs)}|W$  be two graphs of sizes  $n$  and  $n^{\prime}$ , respectively, satisfying Theorem 1. Note that  $n$  can be equal to  $n^\prime$ . Let  $\Gamma_{l - hot}(\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{(obs)}|W)$  be defined as in Equation (7) and  $\| \cdot \|_{\infty}$  denote the  $L$ -infinity norm.. Then, for any integer  $k\leq n$ $0 < \epsilon < 1$

$$
\operatorname * {P r} (| | \Gamma_ {1 - h o t} (\overline {{\mathcal {G}}} _ {n} ^ {(o b s)} | W) - \Gamma_ {1 - h o t} (\mathcal {G} _ {n ^ {\prime}} ^ {(o b s)} | W) | | _ {\infty} > \epsilon) \leq 2 | \mathcal {F} _ {\leq k} | (\exp (- \frac {\epsilon^ {2}}{8 k ^ {2}} n) + \exp (- \frac {\epsilon^ {2}}{8 k ^ {2}} n ^ {\prime})). \quad (8)
$$

Theorem 2 shows that for  $k \ll \min(n, n')$ , the representations  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}(\cdot)$  of two possibly different-sized graphs with the same  $W$  are nearly identical. Hence,  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}(\overline{\mathcal{G}}_{N^{\text{(obs)}}}|W)$  is an approximately E-invariant representation for  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_{N^{\text{(obs)}}}|W$ . Theorem 2 also exposes a trade-off, however. If the observed graphs tend to be relatively small, the required  $k$  for nearly E-invariant representations can be small, and, as a result, the expressiveness of  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}(\cdot)$  gets compromised. That is, the ability of  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}(\cdot)$  to extract information about  $W$  from  $\overline{\mathcal{G}}_{N^{\text{(obs)}}}|W$  reduces as  $k$  decreases. Finally, this guarantees that for appropriate  $k$ , passing the representation  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}(\overline{\mathcal{G}}_n^{\text{(obs)}}|W)$  to a downstream classifier provably approximates the classifier in Equation (5) of Proposition 1. We defer the choice of downstream model and respective bounds to future work and now turn our attention to attributed graphs.

# 3.2 EXTRAPOLATIONS FOR ATTRIBUTED GRAPHS

We now extend the representation  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}(\cdot)$  in Equation (7) to attributed graphs  $G_{n}$ . Attributed graph extrapolation models should also represent the attribute-definer variable  $C_E^\prime$  of Theorem 1, but be E-invariant if possible. Hence, we should not just extend Equation (7) by making  $F_{k^{\prime}}$  attributed and generalize the injective homomorphism density of Equation (6) to  $t_{\mathrm{a - inj}}(F_{k^{\prime}},G_n)$  which counts attributed graphs, as the representation would not be E-invariant.

To create attributed graph representations that are less sensitive to environments (but not E-invariant, unfortunately), we start with three observations: First,  $\Gamma_{1\mathrm{-hot}}(\cdot)$  in Equation (7) is still E-invariant for attributed graphs, but only carries information about the graph structure ( $W'$  of Theorem 1), not its attributes ( $C_E'$  of Theorem 1). Second, graph neural networks(GNNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017; You et al., 2019) learn representations that can capture information from vertex attributes (and edge attributes with some ingenuity). Third, in their Eric-Irma discussions, Arjovsky et al. (2019) observes that very expressive, over-parametrized, neural networks are more

prone to be E-invariant than low capacity representations, since low capacity representations prefer exploiting spurious correlations which tend to be easier to detect.

Hence, our proposal replaces the one-hot vector  $\mathbf{1}_{\mathrm{one - hot}}\{F_{k'},\mathcal{F}_{\leq k}\}$  with a GNN applied to  $F_{k'}$

$$
\Gamma_ {\mathrm {G N N}} \left(G _ {n}\right) = \sum_ {F _ {k ^ {\prime}} \in \mathcal {F} _ {\leq k}} t _ {\mathrm {a - i n j}} \left(F _ {k ^ {\prime}}, G _ {n}\right) \text {R E A D O U T} \left(\mathrm {G N N} \left(F _ {k ^ {\prime}}\right)\right), \tag {9}
$$

where READOUT is a permutation-invariant representation such as a sum, Deep Sets (Zaheer et al., 2017), or Janossy Pooling (Murphy et al., 2019a), and  $t_{\mathrm{a - inj}}(F_{k'}, G_n)$  is the injective homomorphism density defined over attributed graphs. Unfortunately, GNNs are not most-expressive representations of graphs (Morris et al., 2019; Murphy et al., 2019b; Xu et al., 2018a) and thus  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{GNN}}(\cdot)$  is less expressive than  $\Gamma_{1\mathrm{-hot}}(\cdot)$  for unattributed graphs. A representation with greater expressive power is

$$
\Gamma_ {\mathrm {G N N} ^ {+}} \left(G _ {n}\right) = \sum_ {F _ {k ^ {\prime}} \in \mathcal {F} _ {\leq k}} t _ {\text {a - i n j}} \left(F _ {k ^ {\prime}}, G _ {n}\right) \text {R E A D O U T} \left(\mathrm {G N N} ^ {+} \left(F _ {k ^ {\prime}}\right)\right), \tag {10}
$$

where  $\mathrm{GNN}^+$  is a most-expressive  $k$ -vertex graph representation, which can be achieved by any of the methods of Vignac et al. (2020); Maron et al. (2019a); Murphy et al. (2019b). Since  $\mathrm{GNN}^+$  is most expressive,  $\mathrm{GNN}^+$  can ignore attributes and map each  $F_{k'}$  to a one-hot vector  $\mathbf{1}_{\mathrm{one - hot}}\{F_{k'}, \mathcal{F}_{\leq k}\}$ ; therefore,  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{GNN}^+}(\cdot)$  generalizes  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}(\cdot)$  of Equation (7) and can choose to be E-invariant by disregarding information about the attributes.

# 3.3 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

While the literature does not offer fast algorithms to count all possible  $k$ -vertex injective homomorphism densities in a graph, there is a bijection between induced and injective homomorphism densities (Borgs et al., 2006). So, we can use induced homomorphism densities in our representations without losing expressiveness. While this remains expensive - taking at least  $n^{\Omega(k)}$  running time (Chen et al., 2005) if the Exponential Time Hypothesis (Impagliazzo et al., 2001) is true - efficient algorithms exist to estimate induced homomorphism densities over all possible connected  $k$ -vertex subgraphs (Ahmed et al., 2016; Bressan et al., 2017; Chen & Lui, 2018; Chen et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2014). Since the densities of disconnected  $k'$ -vertex subgraphs are likely very correlated with that of connected  $k''$ -vertex subgraphs,  $k'' < k'$ , there should be little information lost in restricting  $\mathcal{F}_{\leq k}$  in Equations (7), (9) and (10) to contain only connected  $F_{k'}$ .

For unattributed graphs and  $k \leq 5$ , we use ESCAPE (Pinar et al., 2017) to obtain exact induced homomorphism densities of each connected subgraph of size  $\leq k$ . For attributed graphs or unattributed graphs with  $k > 5$ , exact counting becomes intractable so we use R-GPM (Teixeira et al., 2018) to obtain unbiased estimates of induced homomorphism counts, from which we compute densities. Finally, Proposition 2 in the Appendix shows that certain biased estimators can be used without losing information in the representations in Equation (10) if READOUT is the sum of vertex embeddings.

# 4 RELATED WORK

This section presents an overview of the related work. Due to space constraints, a more in-depth discussion with further references are given in the Appendix. In particular, the Appendix gives a detailed description of environment-invariant methods that require multiple environments in training, including Independence of Causal Mechanism (ICM), Causal Discovery from Change (CDC) methods, and representation disentanglement methods. Also, none of these works focus on graphs.

Counterfactual mechanisms in graph classification/regression and other extrapolation work. There are two key sources of causal relationships on graph classification/regression tasks: Conterfactuals on graphs, interested in cause-effects events related to processes running on top of a graph, such as Eckles et al. (2016a;b). Conterfactuals of graphs, which is the topic of our work, where we want to ascertain a counterfactual relationship between graphs and their targets in the tasks. We are unaware of prior work in this topic. The parallel work of Xu et al. (2020) (already discussed) is interested in the narrower geometric definition of extrapolation. Previous works also examine empirically the ability of graph networks to extrapolate in physics (Battaglia et al., 2016; Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2018), mathematical and abstract reasoning (Santoro et al., 2018; Saxton et al., 2019), and graph algorithms (Bello et al., 2017; Nowak et al., 2017; Battaglia et al., 2018; Velickovic et al., 2018). These works offer little theoretical analysis for why these methods should extrapolate, or a proof

that the tasks are really extrapolation tasks over different environments. We hope our work will help guide future extrapolation analysis.

Graph classification/regression using induced homomorphism densities. A related interesting set of works look at induced homomorphism densities as graph features for a kernel (Shervashidze et al., 2009; Yanardag & Vishwanathan, 2015; Wale et al., 2008). Kriege et al. (2018) reports that these methods can perform poorly in some tasks. These works focus on generalization (interpolation) error only.

GNN-type representations and subgraph methods. Common GNN methods lack the ability to distinguish nonisomorphic graphs (Morris et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018a) and cannot count the number of subgraphs such as triangles (3-cliques) (Arvind et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020). Proposed solutions (e.g. Dasoulas et al. (2019); Chen et al. (2020)) focus on making substructures distinguishable and thus expressivity/universality rather than learning functions that extrapolate. Closer to our representations, other methods based on subgraphs have been proposed. Procedures like mGCMN (Li et al., 2020), HONE (Rossi et al., 2018), and MCN (Lee et al., 2018) learn representations for vertices by extending methods defined over traditional neighborhood (edge) structures to higher-order graphs based on subgraphs; for instance, mGCMN applies a GNN on the derived graph. These methods will not learn subgraph representations in a manner consistent with our extrapolation task. These and other related works (detailed in the Appendix) focus on generalization (interpolation) error only.

# 5 EMPIRICAL RESULTS

This section is dedicated to the empirical evaluation of our theoretical claims, including the ability of the representations in Equations (7), (9) and (10) to extrapolate in the manner predicted by Proposition 1 for tasks that abide by conditions 1 and 2 of Theorem 1. We also test their ability to extrapolate in tasks that do not perfectly fit conditions 1 and 2 of Theorem 1, and in a task with a real dataset. Our results report (i) interpolation test performance on held out graphs from the same environment used for training; and (ii) extrapolation test performance on held out graphs from different environments. Our code is available<sup>1</sup> and complete details are given in our Appendix.

Interpolation representations: We choose a few methods as examples of graph representation interpolations. While not an extensive list, these methods are representative of the literature. Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) (Xu et al., 2018a); Relational Pooling GIN (RPGIN) (Murphy et al., 2019b); The Weisfeiler Lehman kernel (WL Kernel) (Shervashidze et al., 2011) uses the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm (Weisfeiler & Lehman, 1968) to provide graph representations.

Extrapolation representations: We experiment with the three representations  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}$ ,  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{GNN}}$ , in Equations (7) and (9), and  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{RPGNN}}$ , where we use RPGIN as a method of  $\mathrm{GNN}^+$  in Equation (10). We also test Graphlet counting kernel (GC Kernel) (Shervashidze et al., 2009), which is a method that uses a  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}$  representation as input to a downstream classifier. We report  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}$  separately from GC Kernel since we wanted to add a better downstream classifier than the one used in Shervashidze et al. (2009). Per Section 3.3, we use connected induced subgraph (CIS) densities instead of induced homomorphisms. The CIS size  $k$  is a hyperparameter. Our attributed graph experiments rely on estimated CIS densities, an added source of error.

Extrapolation performance over unattributed graphs of varying size. For these unattributed graph experiments, the task is to extrapolate over environments with different graph sizes. These tasks fulfill the conditions imposed by Theorem 1, which allow us to test our theoretical results.

Schizophrenia task. We use the fMRI brain graph data on 71 schizophrenic patients and 74 controls for classifying individuals with schizophrenia (De Domenico et al., 2016). Vertices represent brain regions with edges as functional connectivity. We process the graph differently between interpolation and extrapolation data, where interpolation has exactly 264 vertices (a single environment) and extrapolation has in average  $40\%$  fewer vertices. The graphs are dense and processing approximate the conditions imposed by Theorem 1. The value of  $k \in \{4,5\}$  and chosen based on a separate validation error over the interpolation environment. Further details are provided in the Appendix.

Erdős-Rényi task. This is an easy interpolation task. We simulate Erdős-Rényi graphs (Gilbert, 1959; Erdős & Rényi, 1959) which by design perfectly satisfies the conditions in Theorem 1. There are two environments: we train and measure interpolation accuracy graphs of size in  $\{20\ldots 80\}$ ; we extrapolate to graphs from an environment with size in  $\{140\ldots 200\}$ . The task is to classify the edge probability  $p \in \{0.2, 0.5, 0.8\}$  of the generated graph. Further details are in the Appendix.

Unattributed graph results: Table 1 shows that our results perfectly follow Proposition 1 and Theorem 2, where representations  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}$  (GC Kernel and new classifier),  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{GNN}}$ ,  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{RPGNN}}$  are the only ones able to extrapolate, while displaying very similar—often identical—interpolation and extrapolation test accuracies in all experiments. All methods perform well in the easier interpolation task.

Extrapolation performance over attributed graphs over varying attributes. Next we try a significantly more challenging scenario, with conditions that clearly violate Theorem 1. Here, the attributed graph environments have a shift in observed attributes. We simulate Erdős-Rényi graphs with  $N^{(\mathrm{obs})} \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(20, \ldots, 25)$  for both interpolation and extrapolation environments. Vertices have red, green, or blue attributes (scheme in Appendix). Target  $Y \sim \# \{5\text{-cliques with no green vertices}\}$ . In the interpolation environment, 5-cliques are predominantly red, while in extrapolation their colors are more uniform. Representations  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}$ ,  $\Gamma_{\text{GNN}}$ ,  $\Gamma_{\text{RPGNN}}$  use estimates of attributed  $k' = 5$  CIS counts, rather than densities due to the task. A representation that learns to merge red and blue clique counts will perform well.

Attributed graph results: Table 2 shows the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) results. We include a train target average predictor to provide a reference for a bad MAE. The results show that interpolation representations and  $\Gamma_{1\text{-hot}}$  (GC Kernel and new classifier) get distracted by the easy relationship between  $Y$  and the density of red cliques, while  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{GNN}}$  and  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{RPGNN}}$  are significantly more robust, giving similar GNN representations to red and blue cliques.  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{GNN}}$  and  $\Gamma_{\mathrm{RPGNN}}$  show a gap between interpolation and extrapolation test errors, likely reflecting the deviation in Theorem 1 conditions.

# 6 CONCLUSIONS

Our work contributes to a growing literature by providing the first systematic counterfactual modeling framework for extrapolations in graph classification/regression tasks. We connected a family of graph extrapolation tasks with Lovász theory of graph limits, and introduced environment-invariant (E-invariant) representations that can provably extrapolate in such scenarios. Our experiments validated our theoretical results and the shortcomings of common (interpolation) methods.
