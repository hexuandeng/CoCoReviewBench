# ABSTRACT

Recovering sparse parameters from observational data is a fundamental problem in machine learning with wide applications. Many classic algorithms can solve this problem with theoretical guarantees, but the theoretical performances depend on choosing the correct hyperparameters. Besides, they do not fully exploit the particular problem distribution of interest. In this work, we propose PLISA (Provable Learning-based Iterative Sparse recovery Algorithm) to learn algorithms automatically from data. PLISA is designed by unrolling a classic path-following algorithm, with some components being more flexible and learnable. With this structure, we theoretically show the improved recovery accuracy achievable by PLISA. Furthermore, we analyze the empirical Rademacher complexity of PLISA to characterize its generalization ability to solve new problems outside the training set. This paper contains novel theoretical contributions to the area of learning-based algorithms in the sense that (i) PLISA is generically applicable to a broad class of sparse estimation problems, (ii) generalization analysis has received less attention so far, and (iii) our analysis makes novel connections between the generalization ability and algorithmic properties such as stability and convergence, which leads to a tighter bound that can explain the empirical observations. The techniques could potentially be applied to analyze other learning-based algorithms in the literature.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The problem of recovering a sparse vector  $\beta^{*}$  from finite observations  $Z_{1:n} \sim (\mathbb{P}_{\beta^{*}})^{n}$  is fundamental in machine learning, covering a broad family of problems including compressed sensing, sparse regression analysis, graphical model estimation, etc. It has also found applications in various domains. For example, in magnetic resonance imaging, sparse signals need to be reconstructed from measurements taken by a scanner. In computational biology, estimating a sparse graph structure from gene expression data is important for understanding gene regulatory networks.

Various classic algorithms are available for solving sparse recovery problems, and many of them come with theoretical guarantees for the recovery accuracy. However, the theoret-

ical performance often relies on choosing the correct hyperparameters, such as regularization parameters and the learning rate, which may depend on unknown constants. Furthermore, in practice, similar problems may need to be solved repeatedly, but it is hard for classic algorithms to fully utilize the information of the particular problem distribution of interest.

To alleviate these limitations, we consider the approach of learning-to-learn and propose a neural algorithm, called PLISA (Provable Learning-based Iterative Sparse recovery Algorithm). PLISA is a deep learning model that takes the observations  $Z_{1:n}$  as the input and outputs an estimation for  $\beta^{*}$ . To make use of classic techniques developed by domain experts, we design the architecture of PLISA by unrolling and modifying a classic path-following algorithm proposed by Wang et al. (2014). To benefit from learning, some components in this classic algorithm are made more flexible

with careful design and treated as learnable parameters in PLISA. These parameters can be learned by optimizing the performances on a set of training problems. The learned PLISA can then be used for solving other problems in the target distribution. With the algorithm design problem converted to a deep learning problem, we naturally ask the two important questions:

1. Capacity: What's the recovery accuracy achievable by PLISA? Can the flexible components in PLISA lead to an algorithm which effectively improves the recovery performance?  
2. Generalization: How well can the learned PLISA solve new problems outside the training set? Is the generalization behavior related to the algorithmic properties of PLISA?

Aiming at supplying rigorous answers to these questions, we conduct theoretical analysis of PLISA to provide guarantees for its recovery performance, measure its empirical Rademachar complexity, and characterize its generalization ability. The results and the techniques in our analysis can distinguish our work from existing studies on algorithm learning and deep unrolling, which has become an active research direction recently. To be more specific, we summarize our new and novel contributions into the following three aspects.

Theoretical understanding. In contrast to the plethora of empirical studies on algorithm learning, there have been relatively few studies devoted to the theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical efforts primarily focus on analyzing the convergence rate achievable by the neural algorithm (Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019a; Zhang & Ghanem, 2018; Wu et al., 2020), but the generalization error bound has received less attention so far. A substantial body of works only argue intuitively that algorithm unrolling architectures can generalize well because they contain a small number of parameters. In comparison, we provide theoretical guarantees for both the capacity and the generalization ability of PLISA, which are more solid arguments.

Novel connection. The algorithmic structure in the architecture of PLISA can make it behaves differently from conventional neural networks. Therefore, we largely utilize the analysis techniques in classic algorithms to derive its generalization bound. By combining the analysis tools of deep learning theory and optimization algorithms, our result reveals a novel connection between the generalization ability of PLISA and its algorithmic properties including the convergence rate and stability. Benefit from this connection, our generalization bound is tight in the sense that it matches the interesting behavior of PLISA observed in experiments - the generalization gap could decrease in the number of layers, which is rarely observed in conventional neural networks.

General setting. The problem setting in this paper is new and more challenging. Existing works mainly focus on a specific problem. For example, the compressed sensing problem with a fixed design matrix is the mostly investigated one. PLISA, however, is generic and is applicable to various sparse recovery problems as long as they satisfy certain conditions in Assumption 3.1. This is complementary to the literature of algorithm learning.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we elaborate on the proposed architecture of PLISA, and present the learning-to-learn setting under which we learn the parameters. Section 3 states our first theoretical result on the achievable recovery performance of PLISA. Section 4 is devoted to the generalization analysis of PLISA. In Section 5, we summarize the related works. Section 6 supplies results of numerical simulations. Proofs are contained in the Appendix.

# 2 PLISA: LEARNING TO SOLVE SPARSE ESTIMATION PROBLEMS

A sparse estimation problem is to recover  $\beta^{*}$  from finite observations  $Z_{1:n}$  sampled from  $\mathbb{P}_{\beta^{*}}$ . As a concrete example, in a sparse linear regression problem,  $n$  observations  $\{Z_i = (x_i,y_i)\}_{i = 1}^n$  are sampled from a linear model  $y = x^{\top}\beta^{*} + \epsilon$ , and an algorithm needs to estimate the vector  $\beta^{*}$  in this linear model from the  $n$  observations. Therefore, an oracle algorithm that perfectly recovers the true parameter can be view as a function that maps the observations  $Z_{1:n}$  to  $\beta^{*}$ :

# Oracle algorithm (function):  $Z_{1:n} \mapsto \beta^{*}$ .

Based on the equivalent view of algorithms and functions, we propose to approximate the oracle algorithm by a deep learning model, called  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$ . In this section, we will first describe the architecture of  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  and explain its design principles. After that, we will describe how to optimize the parameters in  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  under the learning-to-learn setting.

# 2.1 ARCHITECTURE OF  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$

A naive architecture could be a feed-forward or recurrent neural network that takes  $Z_{1:n}$  as the input and outputs a  $d$ -dimensional vector. However, a more favorable design choice in the literature of algorithm learning is algorithm unrolling, which unrolls and truncates a classic iterative algorithm to design the architecture. Based on this idea, we use a classic path-following algorithm proposed by Wang et al. (2014) as the basis to design  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$ .

The key idea of path-following algorithms is creating a sequence of surrogate objective functions to gradually approach the target objective function, which is supposed to be more difficult to solve. Following the similar design-logic of the path-following algorithm in Wang et al. (2014),  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  is designed to sequentially approximate the local minimizers of a sequence of objectives,

for  $t = 1,\dots ,T$

$$
\beta_ {t} \left(Z _ {1: n}; \theta\right) \approx \widehat {\beta} _ {\boldsymbol {\lambda} _ {t}} \in \arg \min  L _ {n} \left(Z _ {1: n}, \boldsymbol {\beta}\right) + P _ {\boldsymbol {w}} \left(\boldsymbol {\lambda} _ {t}, \boldsymbol {\beta}\right) \tag {1}
$$

with regularization parameters  $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_T$ . In this objective,  $L_n$  is an empirical loss that measures the "fit" between a parameter  $\beta$  and the observations  $Z_{1:n}$ . As an example, it can be the least squared loss for solving linear regression problems. The second term in the objective,  $P_w$ , is a sparsity penalty function, which is set to be  $\lambda \| \beta \|_1$  in many classic algorithms.

Consequently, as illustrated by Fig. 2 and Algorithm 1, the architecture of  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  contains  $T$  recurrent cells. The  $t$ -th cell corresponds to the  $t$ -th objective in Eq. 1, and it contains a  $K$ -step algorithm that iteratively minimizes the cell-specific objective.

While maintaining the overall structure of the pathfollowing algorithm,  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  is more flexible, as it contains learnable parameters  $\theta = \{\pmb {\eta},\pmb{\lambda}^{*},\pmb {w},\alpha \}$  that consist of (i) learnable decrease ratios  $\pmb{\eta}$  and learnable target regularization parameters  $\lambda^*$  that jointly determine the sequence of regularization pa

rameters  $\lambda_1,\dots ,\lambda_T$  ; (ii) a learnable sparsity penalty function  $P_{\pmb{w}}$  with parameters  $\pmb{w}$  ; and (iii) a learnable step size  $\alpha$  for the optimization steps in the cells.

We explain the details in the following. Red-colored symbols are used to indicate learnable parameters in  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$ . The concrete computations in  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  are presented in Algorithm 1.

(i) Entry-wise regularization parameters. Given input samples  $Z_{1:n}$ , the regularization parameters are initialized by a vector  $\lambda_0 \coloneqq \nabla_\beta L_n(Z_{1:n}, \mathbf{0})$ . Then  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  will update it sequentially by

$$
\boldsymbol {\lambda} _ {t} \leftarrow \max  \left\{\sigma (\boldsymbol {\eta}) \circ \boldsymbol {\lambda} _ {t - 1}, \boldsymbol {\lambda} ^ {*} \right\}, \quad \text {f o r} t = 1, \dots , T, \tag {2}
$$

where  $\sigma(\cdot)$  is the element-wise sigmoid function,  $\circ$  is element-wise multiplication,  $\max\{\cdot, \cdot\}$  is element-wise maximization, and  $\{\eta, \lambda^*\}$  are learnable parameters. This operation will create a decreasing sequence  $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_T$  through the entry-wise decrease ratio  $\sigma(\eta)$ , until they reach the entry values of the learnable target vector  $\lambda^*$ . It is worth mentioning that different from classic algorithms which employ a uniform regularization parameter  $\lambda$  across all entries of  $\beta$ , PLISA $_\theta$  always maintains a  $d$ -dimensional vector  $\lambda_t = [\lambda_{t,1}, \dots, \lambda_{t,d}]^\top$  to enforce different levels of sparse penalty to different entries.

(ii) Penalty function. Unlike classic algorithms that use a pre-defined penalty function such as the  $\ell_1$  regularizer,  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  parameterizes the penalty function as follows,

$$
P _ {\boldsymbol {w}} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}, \boldsymbol {\beta}) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {q} \widetilde {w _ {i}} \cdot P ^ {(i)} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}, \boldsymbol {\beta}), \quad \text {w h e r e} \widetilde {w _ {i}} = \frac {\exp \left(w _ {i}\right)}{\sum_ {i ^ {\prime} = 1} ^ {q} \exp \left(w _ {i ^ {\prime}}\right)}. \tag {3}
$$

key function  $P_{\pmb{w}}$  with parameters  $\pmb{w}$ ; and (iii) any cells.

(i) Entry-wise regularization parameters. Given input samples  $Z_{1:n}$ , the regularization parameters are initialized by a vector  $\lambda_0 \coloneqq \nabla_\beta L_n(Z_{1:n}, \mathbf{0})$ . Then  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  will update it sequentially by

where  $\sigma(\cdot)$  is the element-wise sigmoid function,  $\circ$  is element-wise multiplication,  $\max\{\cdot, \cdot\}$  is element-wise maximization, and  $\{\eta, \lambda^*\}$  are learnable parameters. This operation will create a decreasing sequence  $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_T$  through the entry-wise decrease ratio  $\sigma(\eta)$ , until they reach the entry values of the learnable target vector  $\lambda^*$ . It is worth mentioning that different from classic algorithms which employ a uniform regularization parameter  $\lambda$  across all entries of  $\beta$ , PLISA $_\theta$  always maintains a  $d$ -dimensional vector  $\lambda_t = [\lambda_{t,1}, \dots, \lambda_{t,d}]^\top$  to enforce different levels of sparse penalty to different entries.

In other words,  $P_{\mathbf{w}}$  is a convex combination of  $q$  penalty functions  $(P^{(1)}, \dots, P^{(q)})$ , in which the weights of these functions are determined by a learnable vector  $\mathbf{w} = [w_1, \dots, w_q]$ . In this paper, we focus on learning the combination of three well-known penalty functions:

$$
P ^ {(1)} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}, \boldsymbol {\beta}) = \| \boldsymbol {\lambda} \circ \boldsymbol {\beta} \| _ {1}, P ^ {(2)} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}, \boldsymbol {\beta}) = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {p} \operatorname {M C P} \left(\lambda_ {j}, \beta_ {j}\right), P ^ {(3)} (\boldsymbol {\lambda}, \boldsymbol {\beta}) = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {p} \operatorname {S C A D} \left(\lambda_ {j}, \beta_ {j}\right),
$$

where  $P^{(1)}$  is convex, and MCP (Zhang, 2010a) and SCAD (Fan & Li, 2001) are nonconvex penalties whose analytical forms are given in Appendix B. In fact, one can include any other penalty functions as long as they satisfy a set of conditions specified in Appendix B.

(iii)  $\mathsf{Cell}_{\boldsymbol{w},\alpha}^{K}$  and the step size. As mentioned earlier, each cell in  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  contains a  $K$ -step algorithm that iteratively minimizes the cell-specific objective in Eq. 1. Mathematically, given the inputs  $Z_{1:n}$ ,  $\beta_{t-1}$ , and  $\lambda_t$ , the  $t$ -th cell  $\mathsf{Cell}_{\boldsymbol{w},\alpha}^{K}$  initialize  $\widetilde{\beta}_t^0$  by the output of last cell  $\beta_{t-1}$ , and computes the following modified proximal gradient steps:

$$
\left. \right. \text {f o r} k = 1, \dots , K, \quad \widetilde {\boldsymbol {\beta}} _ {t} ^ {k} \leftarrow \mathcal {T} _ {\alpha \cdot \boldsymbol {\lambda} _ {t}} \left(\widetilde {\boldsymbol {\beta}} _ {t} ^ {k - 1} - \alpha \left(\nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\beta}} L _ {n} \left(Z _ {1: n}, \widetilde {\boldsymbol {\beta}} _ {t} ^ {k - 1}\right) + \nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\beta}} Q _ {\boldsymbol {w}} \left(\boldsymbol {\lambda} _ {t}, \widetilde {\boldsymbol {\beta}} _ {t} ^ {k - 1}\right)\right)\right). \tag {4}
$$

cell output:  $\mathsf{Cell}_{\pmb{w},\alpha}^{K}(Z_{1:n},\pmb{\beta}_{t-1},\pmb{\lambda}_t) = \pmb{\beta}_t = \widetilde{\pmb{\beta}}_t^K$  (5)

In the classic algorithm, the step size  $\alpha$  in Eq. 4 is obtained by performing line-search. In  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$ ,  $\alpha$  is a learnable parameter. Experimentally, we find this is much more efficient and effective.

For the notations in Eq. 4,  $\mathcal{T}_{\alpha \cdot \lambda_t}$  is the entry-wise soft-thresholding function, defined as  $[\mathcal{T}_{\delta}(\beta)]_j \coloneqq \mathrm{sign}(\beta_j)\max \{| \beta_j | - \delta_j, 0 \}$ . The function  $Q_{\pmb{w}}$  represents the concave component of the penalty function  $P_{\pmb{w}}$ , defined as  $Q_{\pmb{w}}(\pmb{\lambda}, \pmb{\beta}) \coloneqq P_{\pmb{w}}(\pmb{\lambda}, \pmb{\beta}) - \| \pmb{\lambda} \circ \pmb{\beta} \|_1$ . The analytical form of its gradient  $\nabla_{\beta} Q_{\pmb{w}}(\pmb{\lambda}_t, \pmb{\beta})$  can be found in Appendix B.

Discussion. We choose the path-following algorithm in (Wang et al., 2014) as the basis to design  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  because this algorithm is applicable to nonconvex losses  $L_{n}$  and nonconvex penalty functions  $P_{w}$ . This allows  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  to be applicable to a broader class of problems (e.g., nonlinear sparse regression problems may involve nonconvex loss). Furthermore, employing nonconvex  $L_{n}$  and  $P_{w}$  can potentially lead to better statistical properties (Fan & Li, 2001; Fan et al., 2009; Loh & Wainwright, 2015), for which we will explain more in Section 3 and in experiments.

# 2.2 LEARNING-TO-LEARN SETTING

Now we describe how to train the parameters  $\theta$  in  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  under the learning-to-learn setting.

Training set. Similar to other works in this domain, we assume the access to  $m$  problems from the target problem-space  $\mathcal{P}$ , and use them as the training set:

$$
\mathcal {D} _ {m} = \left\{\left(Z _ {1: n _ {1}} ^ {(1)}, \boldsymbol {\beta} ^ {* (1)}\right), \dots , \left(Z _ {1: n _ {m}} ^ {(m)}, \boldsymbol {\beta} ^ {* (m)}\right) \right\} \quad \text {w i t h} \quad \left(Z _ {1: n _ {i}} ^ {(i)}, \boldsymbol {\beta} ^ {* (i)}\right) \in \mathcal {P}.
$$

Here each estimation problem is represented by a pair of observations and the corresponding true parameter to be recovered. A different problem  $i$  can contain a different number  $n_i$  of observations.

Training loss. Since the intermediate outputs  $\beta_{t}(Z_{1:n};\theta)$  of  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  are also estimates of  $\beta^{*}$ , a common design of the training loss is the weighted sum of the intermediate estimation errors (Chen et al., 2021). More specifically, we employ the following training loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {t r a i n}} ^ {\gamma} \left(\mathcal {D} _ {m}; \theta\right) := \frac {1}{m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \gamma^ {T - t} \left\| \beta_ {t} \left(Z _ {1: n _ {i}} ^ {(i)}; \theta\right) - \beta^ {* (i)} \right\| _ {2} ^ {2}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\gamma < 1$  is a discounting factor. If  $\gamma = 0$  then the loss is only estimated at the last layer.

Generalization error. The ultimate goal of algorithm learning is to minimize the estimation error on expectation over all problems in the target problem distribution:

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {g e n}} \left(\mathbb {P} (\mathcal {P}); \theta\right) := \mathbb {E} _ {\left(Z _ {1: n}, \boldsymbol {\beta} ^ {*}\right) \sim \mathbb {P} (\mathcal {P})} \left\| \boldsymbol {\beta} _ {T} \left(Z _ {1: n}; \theta\right) - \boldsymbol {\beta} ^ {*} \right\| _ {2} ^ {2}, \tag {7}
$$

where  $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{P})$  is some distribution in the target problem-space  $\mathcal{P}$ . Similar to other machine learning problems, this generalization error depends on both the (i) empirical error (i.e., training loss) and the (ii) generalization gap. We will theoretically characterize them in Section 3 and Section 4.

# 3 CAPACITY OF PLISA

Can  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  recover the true parameters accurately within a small number of layers (cells)? In this section, we answer this question by theoretically showing that  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  can achieve a smaller training error compared to the classic algorithm. Moreover,  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  enjoys a fast convergence rate, and therefore the small training error can be obtained without using too many layers.

# 3.1 PROBLEM SPACE ASSUMPTIONS

Before stating the theorem, we follow the notations in Wang et al. (2014); Loh & Wainwright (2015) to describe some classic assumptions on the estimation problems.

Assumption 3.1 (Problem Space). Let  $s^*, \tilde{s}$  be positive integers and  $\rho_{-}, \rho_{+}$  be positive constants such that  $\tilde{s} > (121(\rho_{+} / \rho_{-}) + 144(\rho_{+} / \rho_{-})^{2})s^{*}$ . Assume for every estimation problem  $(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})$  in the space  $\mathcal{P}$ , the following conditions are satisfied.

(a)  $\| \beta^{*}\|_{0}\leq s^{*}$  and  $\| \beta^{*}\|_{\infty}\leq B_{1}$  
(b) For any nonzero  $\pmb{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  with sparsity  $\| \pmb{v} \|_0 \leq s^* + 2\tilde{s}$ , it holds  $\frac{\pmb{v}^\top \nabla_\beta^2 L_n(Z_{1:n}, \pmb{\beta}) \pmb{v}}{\|\pmb{v}\|_2^2} \in [\rho_{-}, \rho_{+}]$ ;  
(c)  $8\left|\left[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\boldsymbol{\beta}^{*})\right]_{j}\right| \leq \left|\left[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\mathbf{0})\right]_{j}\right| \leq B_{2}, \forall j = 1,\dots ,d.$

Condition (a) assumes  $\beta^{*}$  is  $s^{*}$ -sparse and  $B_{1}$ -bounded. Condition (b) is commonly referred to as 'sparse eigenvalue condition' (Zhang, 2010b; Wang et al., 2014), which is weaker than the well-known restricted isometry property (RIP) in compressed sensing (Candes & Tao, 2005). Note that the class of functions satisfying conditions of this type is much larger than the class of convex losses. In the special case when  $L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\beta)$  is strongly convex in  $\beta$ , condition (b) holds with  $\tilde{s} \to \infty$ . The last condition bounds the gradient of the empirical loss  $L_{n}$  at the true parameter  $\beta^{*}$  and  $\mathbf{0}$ .

# 3.2 FIRST MAIN RESULT: CAPACITY

Let  $\beta_{t}(Z_{1:n};\theta)$  be the output of the  $t$ -th cell in  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$ . Let  $\pmb{x} \vee a$  denote entry-wise maximal value  $\max \{\pmb{x}, a\}$ . Let  $(\pmb{x})_S$  denote the sub-vector of  $\pmb{x}$  with entries indexed by the set  $S$ .

Theorem 3.1 (Capacity). Assume the problem space  $\mathcal{P}$  satisfies Assumption 3.1 and  $\mathcal{D}_m \subseteq \mathcal{P}$ . Let  $T$  be the number of cells in  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  and let  $K$  be the number of layers in each cell. For any  $\varepsilon > 0$ , there exists a set of parameters  $\theta = \{\pmb{\eta}, \pmb{\lambda}^*, \pmb{w}, \alpha\}$  such that the estimation error of every problem  $(Z_{1:n}, \beta^{*}) \in \mathcal{D}_m$  is bounded as follows,  $\forall T > t_0$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left\| \boldsymbol {\beta} _ {T} \left(Z _ {1: n}; \theta\right) - \boldsymbol {\beta} ^ {*} \right\| _ {2} \leq \varepsilon^ {- 1} c _ {\theta} s ^ {*} \exp \left(- C _ {\theta} K \left(T - t _ {0}\right)\right) \quad \text {o p t i m i z a t i o n e r r o r} (8) \\ + c _ {\theta} ^ {\prime} \kappa_ {m} \| (\nabla_ {\beta} L _ {n} (Z _ {1: n}, \boldsymbol {\beta} ^ {*}) \vee \varepsilon) _ {S ^ {*}} \| _ {2}, \quad \text {s t a t i s t i c e r r o r} (9) \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $S^{*} \coloneqq \mathrm{supp}(\beta^{*})$  is the support indices of  $\beta^{*}$ ,  $c_{\theta}, c_{\theta}^{\prime}$ , and  $C_{\theta}$  are some positive values depending on the chosen  $\theta$ , and  $\kappa_{m}$  is a condition number which reveals the similarity of the problems in  $D_{m}$ . Note that  $K$  and  $t_0$  are required to be larger than certain values, but we will elaborate in Appendix  $D$  that the required lower bounds are small. See Appendix  $D$  for the proof of this theorem.

This estimation error can be interpreted as a combination of the optimization error (in Eq. 8) and the statistical error (in Eq. 9). Eq. 8 shows the optimization error decreases linearly in both  $K$  and  $T$ . This fast convergence rate allows us to use fewer layers and cells in  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$ , which is important because a deeper architecture could be more difficult and less efficient to train. The statistical error in Eq. 9 occurs because of the randomness in  $Z_{1:n}$ . The gradient at the true parameter  $\nabla_{\beta}L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})$  characterizes how well the finite samples  $Z_{1:n}$  can represent the distribution  $\mathbb{P}_{\beta^*}$ .

In the following, we will elaborate on how the design of entry-wise regularization and learnable penalty function have improved the statistical error.

(i) Impact of entry-wise regularization. In classic algorithms that use a uniform regularization parameter,  $\lambda^{*}$  is usually taken to be proportional to  $\| \nabla_{\beta}L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})\|_{\infty}$  in order to achieve the optimal statistical rate (Wang et al., 2014; Loh & Wainwright, 2015). In our case, restricting the regularization to be uniform across entries will lead to an error bound that replaces the norm  $\| (\nabla_{\beta}L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})\lor \varepsilon)_{S^{*}}\|_{2}$  in Eq. 9 by  $\sqrt{s^*} (\| \nabla_{\beta}L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})\|_{\infty}\lor \varepsilon)$ . To understand how the former has improved the latter, we can consider the sparse linear regression problem introduced

in Section 2 with  $L_{n}$  being the least square loss. If the design matrix is normalized such that  $\max_{1\leq j\leq d}\| ([\pmb {x}_1]_j,\dots ,[\pmb {x}_n]_j)\| _2\leq \sqrt{n}$ , then  $\| (\nabla_{\beta}L_n(Z_{1:n},\beta^*)\vee \varepsilon)_{S^*}\| _2\leq C\sqrt{s^* / n}$  with high probability. In comparison,  $\sqrt{s^{*}}\| \nabla_{\beta}L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})\|_{\infty}\leq C\sqrt{s^{*}\log d / n}$  with high probability is a slower statistical rate due to the term  $\log d$

(ii) Impact of learnable penalty function. To explain the benefit of using learnable penalty function, we give a more refined bound for the statistical error in Eq. 9 in the following lemma.

Lemma 3.1 (Refined bound). Assume the same conditions and parameters  $\theta$  in Theorem 3.1. Assume  $T\to \infty$  so that the optimization error can be ignored. For simplicity, assume  $\widetilde{w_3} = 0$  and only consider the weights  $\widetilde{w_1}$  and  $\widetilde{w_2}$  for  $\ell_{1}$  penalty and MCP. Then for every problem  $(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})\in \mathcal{D}_{m}$ :

$$

$$

where  $b > 1$  is a hyperparameter in MCP, and the index sets  $S_1^*$  and  $S_2^*$  are defined as  $S_1^* := \{j \in S^* : |\beta_j^*| \leq b\lambda_j^*\}$  and  $S_2^* := \{j \in S^* : |\beta_j^*| > b\lambda_j^*\}$ . See Appendix D for the proof.

This refined bound reveals the benefit of learning the penalty function because:

1. According to Lemma 3.1, which penalty can minimize the error bound is problem-dependent. More specifically, if  $(8(b\rho_{-} + 1)\kappa_{m} + 1)\| (\nabla_{\beta}L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})\vee \varepsilon)_{S_{1}^{*}}\|_{2}$  is larger than  $(8(b\rho_{-} - 1)\kappa_{m} - 1)\| (\nabla_{\beta}L_{n}(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})\vee \varepsilon)_{S_{2}^{*}}\|_{2}$ , choosing  $\widetilde{w_2} = 0$  can induce a smaller error bound. Otherwise,  $\widetilde{w_2} = 1$  is better. Therefore, learning is a more suitable way of choosing the penalty function.  
2. Apart from the statistical error, the convergence speed  $C_{\theta}$  in Eq. 8 is also affected by the weights, monotonely decreasing in  $\widetilde{w_2}$ . Through gradient-based training, we can automatically find the optimal combination of penalty functions to strike a nice balance between the statistical error and convergence speed.

# 4 GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS

How well can the learned  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  solve new problems outside the training set? In this section, we analyze the generalization gap between the expected loss  $\mathcal{L}_{gen}$  in Eq. 7 and the training loss  $\mathcal{L}_{train}^{\gamma = 0}$  in Eq. 6. In particular, our analysis is conducted in a novel way to focus on answering the questions:

How is the generalization bound of  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  related to its algorithmic properties? And how is it different from conventional neural networks?

# 4.1 SECOND MAIN RESULT: GENERALIZATION BOUND

To analyze the generalization properties of neural networks, many works have adopted the analysis framework of Bartlett & Mendelson (2002) to bound the Rademacher complexity via Dudley's integral (Bartlett et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019; Garg et al., 2020; Joukovsky et al., 2021). A key step in this analysis framework is deriving the robustness of the training loss to the small perturbation in model parameters  $\theta$ . In our case, we can view  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  as an iterative algorithm and therefore borrow the analysis tools of classic optimization algorithms to derive its robustness in  $\theta$ . The following lemma states this key intermediate result, which clearly connects the Lipschitz constant to algorithmic properties of  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$ .

Lemma 4.1 (Robustness to  $\theta$ ). Assume  $\mathcal{P}$  satisfies Assumption 3.1 and  $\mathcal{D}_m \sim \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{P})^m$ . Assume  $\mathsf{PLISA}_{\theta}$  contains  $T > t_0$  cells and  $K$  layers. Consider a parameter space  $\Theta$  in which the parameters satisfy (i)  $\alpha \in [\alpha_{\min}, \frac{1}{\rho_+}]$ , (ii)  $\eta_j \in [\sigma^{-1}(0.9), \eta_{\max}]$ , (iii)  $\widetilde{w_2\frac{1}{b}} + \widetilde{w_3\frac{1}{a - 1}} \leq \xi_{\max} < \rho_-$ , and (iv)  $\lambda_j^* \in [8\sup_{(Z_{1:n,\beta^*}) \in \mathcal{D}_m} |[\nabla_\beta L_n(Z_{1:n}, \beta^*)]_j| \vee \varepsilon, \lambda_{\max}]$  with some positive constants  $\alpha_{\min}$ ,  $\eta_{\max}$ ,  $\xi_{\max}$ , and  $\lambda_{\max}$ . Then for any  $\theta = \{\pmb{\eta}, \pmb{\lambda}^*, \pmb{w}, \alpha\}$  and  $\theta' = \{\pmb{\eta}', \pmb{\lambda}^{*,'}\pmb{w}', \alpha'\}$  in  $\Theta$ , and for

any recovery problem  $(Z_{1:n},\beta^{*})\in \mathcal{D}_{m}$ , the following inequality holds,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left\| \beta_ {T} \left(Z _ {1: n}; \theta\right) - \beta_ {T} \left(Z _ {1: n}; \theta^ {\prime}\right) \right\| _ {2} \leq c _ {1} K \left(T - t _ {0}\right) \sqrt {s ^ {*}} \left| \alpha - \alpha^ {\prime} \right| \underbrace {\exp \left(- C _ {\Theta} K \left(T - t _ {0}\right)\right)} _ {\text {c o n v e r g e n c e r a t e}} (12) \\ + \left(c _ {2} \| \boldsymbol {\eta} - \boldsymbol {\eta} ^ {\prime} \| _ {2} + c _ {3} \| \boldsymbol {\lambda} ^ {*} - \boldsymbol {\lambda} ^ {* \prime} \| _ {2} + c _ {4} \sqrt {d} \| \boldsymbol {w} - \boldsymbol {w} ^ {\prime} \| _ {2}\right) \underbrace {(1 - \exp (- C _ {\Theta} K T))} _ {\text {s t a b i l i t y r a t e}}, (13) \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, c_{4}$  and  $C_{\Theta}$  are some positive constants. Note that similar to Theorem 3.1,  $K$  and  $t_{0}$  are required to be larger than certain small values. See Appendix E.1 for the proof.

Convergence rate & step size perturbation. As indicated in Eq. 12, the Lipschitz constant in the step size  $\alpha$  scales at the same rate as the convergence rate of  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$ , decreasing exponentially in  $T$  and  $K$  (See Fig. 3 for a visualization). To understand this, consider when both step sizes  $\alpha$  and  $\alpha'$  are within the convergence region (i.e.,  $(0, \rho_{+}^{-1}]$ ). After infinitely many steps, their induced outputs will both converge to the same optimal point. This intuitively explains why the output perturbation caused by  $\alpha$ -perturbation has the same decrease rate as the optimization error. In the proof, we exploit the techniques for analyzing algorithm convergence to obtain this result.

# Stability rate & regularization perturbation.

In the literature of optimization, stability of an algorithm expresses its robustness to small perturbation in the optimization objective. This is clearly related to the robustness of  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$  to the perturbation in  $\eta, \lambda^{*}, w$ , because these parameters jointly play the role of learning the regularization  $P_{w}(\lambda_{t}, \beta)$ , which is a part of the optimization objective in Eq. 1. Therefore, we exploit the analysis techniques for algorithmic stability to derive the robustness in  $(\eta, \lambda^{*}, w)$ -perturbation and obtain the Lipschitz constant in Eq. 13, which is bounded but increasing in  $T$  and  $K$  (See Fig. 3 for a visualization).

Based on the key result in Lemma 4.1, we can apply Dudley's integral to measure the empirical

Rademachar complexity which immediately yields the following generalization bound.

Theorem 4.1 (Generalization gap). Assume the assumptions in Lemma 4.1. For any  $\epsilon >0$ , with probability at least  $1 - \epsilon$ , the generalization gap is bounded by

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\text {g e n}} (\mathbb {P} (\mathcal {P}); \theta) - \mathcal {L} _ {\text {t r a i n}} ^ {\gamma = 0} \left(\mathcal {D} _ {m}; \theta\right) \leq c _ {1} \sqrt {m ^ {- 1} \log \left(4 \epsilon^ {- 1}\right)} + \tag {14}
$$

$$
\sqrt{c_{2}m^{-1}\log\big(\sqrt{m}KT\underbrace{\exp(-C_{\Theta}K(T - t_{0}))}_{\text{convergence rate}}\vee 1\big) + c_{3}dm^{-1}\log \big(\sqrt{m}\underbrace{(1 - \exp(-C_{\Theta}KT))}_{\text{stability}}\big)},
$$

where  $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, C_{\Theta}$  are constants independent of  $d, m, K$  and  $T$ . See Appendix E for the proof.

Fig. 3 visualizes how the generalization bound in Theorem 4.1 grows when  $KT$  increases. The two sets of plots look slightly different by picking different constants  $C_{\Theta}$ . We have also tried varying the values of  $c_{2}, c_{3}, d, m$  in Theorem 4.1. Overall, they will lead to the two types of behaviors in Fig. 3. It will increase first and then decrease to a constant, but the speed can vary.

An important observation in Theorem 4.1 and Figure 3 is that the generalization gap could decrease in the number of layers, and this matches the empirical observations of PLISA as we reported in Section 6. It also distinguishes algorithm-unrolling based architectures from conventional neural networks, whose generalization gaps rarely decrease in the number of layers.

Remark. The above generalization results are conducted on a constrained parameter space (as described in Lemma 4.1) so that we can utilize the algorithmic properties of  $\mathrm{PLISA}_{\theta}$ . We focus on this space because the analysis contains more interesting and new ingredients. For parameters outside this space, the analysis procedure is similar to other conventional recurrent networks. Since the bound in Theorem 4.1 has matched the empirical observations, it is reasonable to believe that after training, the learned parameters are likely to be in this 'nice' constrained space.

# 5 RELATED WORK

Learning-to-learn and deep unrolling has become an active research direction in recent years (Franceschi et al., 2017; Niculae et al., 2018; Denevi et al., 2018; Pogancić et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019b; Berthet et al., 2020). Many works share the idea of unrolling an iterative algorithm to design the architecture (Yang et al., 2017; Borgerding et al., 2017; Corbineau et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019; Shrivastava et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020a; Wei et al., 2020). A well-known example is LISTA (Gregor & LeCun, 2010) which interprets ISTA (Daubechies et al., 2004) as layers of neural networks and has since then been an active research topic (Zhang & Ghanem, 2018; Kamilov & Mansour, 2016; Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019a; Wu et al., 2020; Kim & Park, 2020).

However, not many works have been conducted on the theoretical understanding of algorithm learning, especially the generalization ability. The only exceptions are several recent works of Chen et al. (2020b); Wang et al. (2021); Behboodi et al. (2020); Joukovsky et al. (2021). However, Chen et al. (2020b) and Wang et al. (2021) only consider learning to optimize quadratic losses. Behboodi et al. (2020); Joukovsky et al. (2021) do not connect the generalization analysis with algorithmic properties to provide tighter bounds as in our work.

We will refer the audience to Shlezinger et al. (2020); Chen et al. (2021) for a more comprehensive summary of related works in this area.

# 6 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we report the experimental results to validate the effectiveness of PLISA and our theoretical results. We create the synthetic data by sampling a set of linear sparse recovery problems  $\{((X^{(i)},Y^{(i)}),\beta^{*}(i),)\}$ . In each problem, the design matrix  $X^{(i)}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$  contains  $n = 64$  independent realizations of a random vector  $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^d$  with  $d = 256$ , 1024 in easy or difficult setting, respectively.  $\mathbf{x}$  follows a zero mean Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix  $(\Sigma)_{i,j} = 0.9\cdot 1_{\{i\neq j\}} + 1\cdot 1_{\{i = j\}}$ . The true parameter vector  $\beta^{*(i)}$  has a sparsity  $\| \beta^{*(i)}\| _0 = 16$  and its nonzero entries take values uniformly sampled from  $(-2, - \frac{1}{2})\cup (\frac{1}{2},2)$ . The support set of each  $\beta^{*(i)}$  is independently sampled from a union support set  $D$ , with  $|D| = 128$  to allow some similarity among the problems. The observation  $Y^{(i)}$  is sampled such that  $Y^{(i)} - X^{(i)}\beta^{*(i)}$  is a  $n$ -dimensional Gaussian random vector with zero mean and covariance matrix  $\mathbf{I}_n$ . In all the experiments,  $m = 2000$  such problems are used for training.

Recovery performance. In the first experiment, we compare PLISA with alternative methods including APF (Wang et al., 2014), ALISTA (Liu et al., 2019a), RNN (Andrychowicz et al., 2016), and RNN-  $\ell_1$ . APF is the classic approximate path-following algorithm that is used as the basis of our architecture. ALISTA is a representative of the algorithm unrolling based deep architecture, which is an advanced variant of LISTA. We have tried the vanilla LISTA, but it performs worse than ALISTA on our tasks so it is not reported. RNN refers to the LSTM-based model in Andrychowicz et al. (2016) which is applied to learning-to-learn. Besides, we add a soft-thresholding operator to this model to enforce sparsity, and include this variant as a baseline, called

RNN- $\ell_1$ , which reveals to perform better than RNN. Except for APF, all methods are trained on the same set of training problems and selected by the validation problems. For APF, we perform grid-search to choose its hyperparameters, which is also selected by the validation set. The detailed specification of each model can be found in Appendix G.

Figure 4: Convergence of recovery error. Since APF takes a long time to converge, its curve are outside the range of these plots. We use a dashline to represent the final  $\ell_2$  error it achieves.

![](images/a37d8ca977732f008b0505a6db969d5c27eab5fde079038645c79496bcdad394.jpg)

The comparison results are reported in Fig. 4, which shows the convergence of the recovery  $\ell_2$  error,  $\| \beta_t - \beta^*\| _2$ , in which the  $x$ -axis indicates the wall-clock time. It can be seen that in terms of the final recovery accuracy, PLISA outperforms all baseline methods. In the more difficult setting (i.e, when  $d = 1024$ ), its advantage is very obvious. Although PLISA is slightly slower than other

deep learning based models due to the computations of MCP and SCAD, PLISA achieves a better accuracy and it has been converging much faster than the classic algorithm APF.

Ablation study. In the second experiment, we perform an ablation study to verify the effectiveness of the designs in PLISA. We consider two variants of PLISA. One is PLISA-single which employs a single regularization parameter across different entries, i.e.,  $\eta_{1} = \dots = \eta_{d}$  and  $\lambda_1^* = \dots = \lambda_d^*$ . The other is PLISA- $\ell_1$  which does not learn the penalty function but uses the  $\ell_1$  norm as the penalty function, i.e.,  $P_{\boldsymbol{w}}(\boldsymbol{\lambda},\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \| \boldsymbol{\lambda}\circ \boldsymbol{\beta}\| _1$ . As reported in Fig. 5 and Table 1, the vanilla PLISA performs better than the alternatives. Especially, it has a much better accuracy than PLISA-single which does not use entry-wise regularization parameters. Therefore, this ablation study has validated the effectiveness of using entry-wise regularization parameters and learning the penalty function.

Generalization gap. We are interested in seeing what is the generalization behavior of PLISA experimentally. As this experiment is conducted for theoretical interest, we do not use the validation set to select the model. We vary the number of layers  $(K)$  and cells  $(T)$  in PLISA to create a set of models with different depths. For each depth, we train the model with 2000 training problems, and then test it on

a separate set of 100 problems to approximate the generalization gap. In Fig. 6, we observe the interesting behavior of the generalization gap, where the left one increases in  $KT$  at the beginning and then decreases to a constant, and the right one increases fast and then decreases very slowly. This surprisingly matches the two different visualizations in Fig. 3 of the predicted bound given by Theorem 4.1.

# 7 DISCUSSION

We proposed an algorithm-unrolling based architecture called PLISA for learning to solve sparse parameter recovery problems. We presented a theoretical analysis for both the capacity and generalization ability of PLISA. The results can shed new light on the relation between generalization and the algorithmic properties, and the techniques could be used to derive guarantees for other algorithm-unrolling based architectures. The current work can be extended in the future from several aspects. The model PLISA can be improved, for example, by using a more flexible penalty function (e.g., a conventional neural network) as long as it satisfies Assumption B.1. Theoretically, it will be interesting to extend the current result to the unsupervised learning scenario when the true parameters are unobserved.
