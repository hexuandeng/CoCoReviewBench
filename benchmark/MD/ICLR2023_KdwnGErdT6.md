# ABSTRACT

Although sparse training has been successfully used in various deep learning tasks to save memory and reduce inference time, the reliability of the produced sparse models remains unexplored. Previous research has shown that deep neural networks tend to be over-confident, and we find that sparse training exacerbates this problem. Therefore, calibrating the sparse models is crucial for reliable prediction and decision making. In this paper, we propose a new sparse training method to produce sparse models with improved confidence calibration. In contrast to previous research that uses only one mask to control the sparse topology, our method utilizes two masks, including a deterministic mask and a random mask. The former efficiently searches and activates important weights by exploiting the magnitude of weights and gradients. While the latter brings better exploration and finds more appropriate weight values by random updates. Theoretically, we prove our method can be viewed as a hierarchical variational approximation of a probabilistic deep Gaussian process. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, model architectures, and sparsities show that our method can reduce ECE values by up to  $47.8\%$  and simultaneously maintain or even improve accuracy with only a slight increase in computational and storage burden.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Sparse training is gaining increasing attention and has been used in various deep neural network (DNN) learning tasks (Evci et al., 2020; Dietrich et al., 2021; Sokar et al., 2021; Bibikar et al., 2022). In sparse training, a fraction of weights are set to zero to save memory and reduce inference time, enabling DNNs for resource-constrained situations. The sparse topology is usually controlled by a mask, and various sparse training methods have been proposed to find a suitable mask to achieve comparable or even higher accuracy compared to dense training (Evci et al., 2020; Jayakumar et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Ozdenizci & Legenstein, 2021; Schwarz et al., 2021). However, in order to deploy the sparse models in real-world applications, a key question remains to be answered: how reliable are these models?

There has been a line of work on studying the reliability of dense DNNs (Guo et al., 2017; Nixon et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021b), which means that DNNs should know what it does not know (Wang et al., 2021a). In other words, a model's confidence (the probability associated with the predicted class label) should reflect its ground truth correctness likelihood. However, previous research has shown that DNNs tend to be over-confident (Guo et al., 2017; Rahaman et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2022), suggesting that the model may be too confident to notice incorrect decisions, leading to safety issues in real-world applications such as automated healthcare and self-driving cars (Jiang et al., 2012; Bojarski et al., 2016).

In this work, we provide the first comprehensive study on the reliability of sparse training. We start with the question of how reliable the current sparse training is. We find that the over-confidence problem becomes even more pronounced when sparse training is applied. Figures 1 (a)-(b) show that the gap (blue area) between confidence and accuracy of the sparse model (95% sparsity) is larger than that of the dense model (0% sparsity), implying the sparse model is more over-confident than the dense model. Figure 1 (c) shows the test accuracy (pink curve) and ECE value (blue curve, a measure of reliability) (Guo et al., 2017) at different sparsities. When the accuracy is comparable to dense training (0%-95%), we observe that the ECE values increase with sparsity, implying that

From the high sparse model to the dense model, the ECE value first decreases, then increases, and then decreases again, showing a double descent pattern.  
(c) Test Accuracy and ECE Value

the problem of over-confidence becomes more severe at higher sparsity. And when the accuracy decreases sharply ( $>95\%$ ), the ECE value first decreases and then increases again. This leads to a double descent phenomenon (Nakkiran et al., 2021) when we view the ECE value curve from left to right ( $99.9\% - 0\%$ ) (see Section 6 for more discussion).

To improve the reliability, we propose a new sparse training method to produce well-calibrated predictions while maintaining a high accuracy performance. We call our method "The Calibrated Rigged Lottery" or CigL. Unlike previous sparse training methods with only one mask, our method employs two masks, including a deterministic mask and a random mask, to better explore the sparse topology and weight space. The deterministic one efficiently searches and activates important weights by exploiting the magnitude of weights/gradients. And the random one adds more exploration and leads to better convergence. When approaching the end of training, we collect weights and masks at each epoch, and use the designed weight & mask averaging procedure to combine the collected samples into one sparse model. From theoretical analysis, we show our method can be viewed as a hierarchical variational approximation (Ranganath et al., 2016) to a probabilistic deep Gaussian process (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), which leads to a large family of variational distributions and better Bayesian posterior approximations. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

- We conduct the first comprehensive study on the reliability of sparse training and find that sparse training exacerbates the over-confidence problem of DNNs.  
- We then propose CigL, a new sparse training method that improves confidence calibration with comparable and even higher accuracy.  
- We prove that CigL can be viewed as a hierarchical variational approximation to a probabilistic deep Gaussian process which improves the calibration by better characterizing the posterior.  
- We perform extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, model architectures, and sparsities. CigL reduces ECE values by up to  $47.8\%$  and simultaneously maintain or even improve accuracy with only a slight increase in computational and storage burden.

# 2.1 SPARSE TRAINING

As the scale of models continues to grow, there is an increasing attention to the sparse training which maintains sparse weights throughout the training process. Different sparse training methods have been investigated, and various pruning and growth criteria, such as weight/gradient magnitude, random selection, weight sign, and random selection, are designed (Mocanu et al., 2018; Bellec et al., 2018; Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Mostafa & Wang, 2019; Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2019; Evci et al., 2020; Jayakumar et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Ozdenizci & Legenstein, 2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Schwarz et al., 2021). However, sparse training is more challenging in fully exploring the

weight space because a large portion of the weights are fixed to zero, cutting off the update route and producing spurious local minima (Evci et al., 2019; Sun & Li, 2021; He et al., 2022). Existing sparse training methods use only one mask to determine the sparse topology, which is not sufficient to explore the space well enough to find a reliable model.

# 2.2 CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION IN DNNS

Many studies have been devoted to investigate whether the confidences of DNNs are well-calibrated (Guo et al., 2017; Nixon et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020), and existing research has found DNNs tend to be over-confident (Guo et al., 2017; Rahaman et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2022), which may mislead our choices and cause unreliable decisions in real-world applications. A number of methods have been developed to improve confidence calibration. A widely-used method is temperature scaling (Guo et al., 2017), which adds a scaling parameter to the softmax formulation and adjusts it on a validation set. Some other works incorporate regularization in the training, such as Mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) and label smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016). In addition, Bayesian methods have also shown the ability to improve calibration, such as Monte Carlo Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) and Bayesian deep ensembles (Ashukha et al., 2020). However, current confidence calibration methods have mainly focused on dense training, and how to obtain a well-calibrated DNN in sparse training is more challenging and remains unexplored.

# 3 METHOD

We propose a new sparse training method, CigL, to improve the confidence calibration of the produced sparse models, which simultaneously maintains comparable or even higher accuracy. Specifically, CigL starts with a random sparse network and uses two masks to control the sparse topology and explore the weight space, including a deterministic mask and a random mask. The former is updated periodically to determine the non-zero weights, while the latter is sampled randomly in each iteration to bring better exploration in the model update. Then, with the designed weight & mask averaging, we combine information about different aspects of the weight space to obtain a single output sparse model. Our CigL method is outlined in Algorithm 1.

# 3.1 DETERMINISTIC MASK & RANDOM MASK

In our CigL, we propose to utilize two masks, a deterministic mask  $M$  and a random mask  $Z$ , to search for a sparse model with improved confidence calibration and SOTA accuracy. We will first describe the two masks in detail and discuss how to set their sparsity.

The deterministic mask controls the entire sparse topology with the aim of finding a well-performing sparse model. That is, the mask determines which weights should be activated and which should not. Inspired by the widely-used sparse training method RigL (Evci et al., 2020), we believe a larger weight/gradient magnitude implies that the weight is more helpful for loss reduction and needs to be activated. Thus, CigL removes a portion of the weights with small magnitudes, and activates new weights with large gradient magnitudes at fixed time intervals  $\Delta T$ .

The random mask allows the model to better explore the weight space under sparsity constraints. In each iteration prior to backpropagation, the mask is randomly drawn from Bernoulli distribution. In this way, the mask randomly selects a portion of the non-zero weights to be temporarily deactivated and forces the model to explore more in other directions of the weight space, which adds more randomness in the weight update step and leads to a better exploration of the weight space. As a result, the model is more likely to jump out of spurious local minima while avoiding deviations from the sparse topology found by the deterministic mask.

The sparsity setting of the two masks is illustrated as below. On the one hand, the deterministic mask is responsible for the overall sparsity of the output sparse model. Suppose we want to train a network with  $95\%$  sparsity, the deterministic mask will also have the same sparsity, with only  $5\%$  of the elements being 1. On the other hand, the random mask deactivates some non-zero weights during the training process, producing some temporary models with increasing sparsity. Since highly sparse models (like  $95\%$  sparsity) are sensitive to further increases in sparsity, we set a low sparsity, such

as  $10\%$ , for the random mask so that no significant increases in sparsity and no dramatic degradation in performance occurs in these temporary models.

# 3.2 WEIGHT & MASK AVERAGING

With the two masks designed above, we propose a weight & mask averaging procedure to obtain one single sparse model with improved confidence calibration and comparable or even higher accuracy. We formalize this procedure as follows. We first iteratively update the two masks and model weights. Consistent with widely used sparse training methods (Evci et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021), the deterministic mask stops updating near the end of the training process. While we still continuously draw different random masks from the Bernoulli distribution and collect a pair of sparse weights and random masks  $\{Z^{(t)}, W^{(t)}\}$  at each epoch after the preset  $T^*$ . Then, with these samples, we can produce multiple temporary sparse models  $Z^{(t)} \odot W^{(t)}$  with different weight values and different sparse topologies, which contain more knowledge about the weight space than the single-mask training methods. Finally, inspired by a popular way of combining models (Izmailov et al., 2018; Wortsman et al., 2022), we obtain the single output sparse model by averaging the weights of these temporary sparse models, which can be viewed as a mask-based weighted averaging.

Algorithm 1 CigL  
Input: initialize  $W^{(0)}$ ,  $M$ , and  $W_{\mathrm{CigL}} =$  None, set epoch length  $m$ , update interval  $\Delta T$ , number of iterations  $T$ , start iteration for weight & mask averaging  $T^*$ , random mask rate  $p$ , and learning rate  $\alpha_t$   
for  $t = 1$  to  $T$  do  
Sample a mini-batch data  $B_t$  with size  $n$   
if  $t \mod \Delta T = 0$  then  
Update mask  $M$  using weights and gradients  
Prune and regrow weights  $W^{(t)}$  based on  $M$   
end if  
Sample mask  $Z^{(t)}$  and  $Z_{ij}^{(t)} =$  Bernoulli( $p$ )  
Update sparse weights:  $W^{(t)} = W^{(t-1)} - \alpha_t Z^{(t)} \odot \nabla L(Z^{(t)} \odot W^{(t-1)}; B_t)$   
if  $t \mod m = 0$  and  $t > T^*$  then  
if  $W_{\mathrm{CigL}} =$  None then  
 $W_{\mathrm{CigL}} = W^{(t)} \odot Z^{(t)}$ $n_{\mathrm{models}} = 1$   
else  
 $W_{\mathrm{CigL}} = \frac{W_{\mathrm{CigL}} \cdot n_{\mathrm{models}} + W^{(t)} \odot Z^{(t)}}{n_{\mathrm{models}} + 1}$ $n_{\mathrm{models}} = n_{\mathrm{models}} + 1$   
end if  
end if  
end for  
Output: Sparse Weights  $W_{\mathrm{CigL}}$

# 4.1 CIGL AS A HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN APPROXIMATION

We prove that training sparse neural networks with our CigL are mathematically equivalent to approximating the probabilistic deep GP (Damianou & Lawrence, 2013; Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) with hierarchical variational inference. To demonstrate the equivalence, we show that the objective of CigL is actually to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a hierarchical variational distribution and the posterior of a deep GP. During our study, we do not restrict the type of network architecture so that the results are applicable to a wide range of applications. Due to space constraints, the detailed derivation is shown in Appendix B.

We first present the minimisation objective function of CigL for a sparse neural network (NN) model with  $L$  layers and loss function  $E$ . The sparse weights and bias of the  $l$ -th layer are denoted by  $W_{l} \in \mathbb{R}^{K_{i} \times K_{i-1}}$  and  $b_{l} \in \mathbb{R}^{K_{i}}$  ( $l = 1, \dots, L$ ), and the output prediction is denoted by  $\widehat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{i}$ . Given data  $\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, y_{i}\}$ , we train the NN model by iteratively update the deterministic mask and the sparse weights. Since the random mask is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution, it has no parameters that need to be updated. For deterministic mask updates, we set the portion with the larger weight magnitude to 1 and the rest to 0. For the weight update, we minimise Eq. (1) which is composed of the difference between  $\widehat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{i}$  and the true label  $\boldsymbol{y}_{i}$  and a widely-used  $L_{2}$  regularisation.

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {C i g L}} := \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} E \left(y _ {i}, \widehat {y} _ {i}\right) + \lambda \sum_ {l = 1} ^ {L} \left(\left| \left| \boldsymbol {W} _ {l} \right| \right| _ {2} ^ {2} + \left| \left| \boldsymbol {b} _ {l} \right| \right| _ {2} ^ {2}\right), \tag {1}
$$

where the sparse topology of  $\{\pmb{W}_l, l = 1, \dots, L\}$  is controlled by  $\{M_l, l = 1, \dots, L\}$ .

Then, we derive the minimization objective function of Deep GP which is a flexible probabilistic NN model that can model the distribution of functions (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016). We assume that

$\mathbf{W}_l$  is a random matrix and  $\pmb{w} = \{\pmb{W}_l\}_{l=1}^L$ , and denote the prior by  $p(\pmb{w})$ . Then, the predictive distribution of the deep GP can be expressed as Eq. (2) given a precision  $\tau > 0$

$$
p (\boldsymbol {y} | \boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {X}, \boldsymbol {Y}) = \int p (\boldsymbol {y} | \boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {w}) p (\boldsymbol {w} | \boldsymbol {X}, \boldsymbol {Y}) d \boldsymbol {w}, \tag {2}
$$

$$
p (\boldsymbol {y} | \boldsymbol {x}, \boldsymbol {w}) = \mathcal {N} (\boldsymbol {y}; \widehat {\boldsymbol {y}}, \tau^ {- 1} \boldsymbol {I}), \quad \widehat {\boldsymbol {y}} = \sqrt {\frac {1}{K _ {L}}} \boldsymbol {W} _ {L} \sigma \left(\dots \sqrt {\frac {1}{K _ {1}}} \boldsymbol {W} _ {2} \sigma \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {1} \boldsymbol {x} + \boldsymbol {u} _ {1}\right)\right).
$$

The posterior distribution  $p(\boldsymbol{w}|\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{Y})$  is intractable, and one way of training the deep GP is variational inference where a family of tractable distributions  $q(\boldsymbol{w})$  is chosen to approximate the posterior. Specifically, we define the hierarchy of  $q(\boldsymbol{w})$  as Eq. (3)

$$
q \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {l i j} \mid \boldsymbol {Z} _ {l i j}, \boldsymbol {U} _ {l i j}, \boldsymbol {M} _ {l}\right) \sim \boldsymbol {Z} _ {l i j} \cdot \mathcal {N} \left(\boldsymbol {M} _ {l i j} \boldsymbol {U} _ {l i j}, \sigma^ {2}\right) + (1 - \boldsymbol {Z} _ {l i j}) \cdot \mathcal {N} (0, \sigma^ {2}),
$$

$$
q \left(\boldsymbol {M} _ {l} \mid \boldsymbol {U} _ {l}\right) \propto \exp \left(\boldsymbol {M} _ {l} \odot \left| \boldsymbol {U} _ {l} \right|\right), \quad \boldsymbol {U} _ {l i j} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(\boldsymbol {V} _ {l i j}, \sigma^ {2}\right), \quad \boldsymbol {Z} _ {l i j} \sim \operatorname {B e r n o u l l i} (p _ {l}), \tag {3}
$$

where  $l = 1, \dots, L$ ,  $i$  and  $j$  denote the row and column index,  $M_{l}$  is a matrix that takes the value 0 or 1, and the number of 1 is restricted,  $W_{l}$  is the sparse weights,  $U_{l}$  is the variational parameters, and  $V_{l}$  is the variational hyper parameters.

We iteratively update  $M_{l}$  and  $W_{l}$  to approximate the posterior. For the update of  $M_{l}$ , we obtain a point estimate by maximising  $q(M_{l}|U_{l})$  under the sparsity constraint, which is equivalent to setting the part with larger weight magnitude to 1 and the rest to 0. For the update of  $W_{l}$ , we minimise the KL divergence between  $q(\boldsymbol{w})$  and the posterior of deep GP as shown in Eq. (4)

$$
- \int q (\boldsymbol {w}) \log p (\boldsymbol {Y} | \boldsymbol {X}, \boldsymbol {w}) d \boldsymbol {w} + D _ {\mathrm {K L}} (q (\boldsymbol {w}) \| p (\boldsymbol {w})). \tag {4}
$$

For the first term in Eq. (4), we can first rewrite it as  $-\sum_{n=1}^{N} \int q(\boldsymbol{w}) \log p(y_n | \boldsymbol{x}_n, \boldsymbol{w})$ . Then, we can approximate each integration in the sum with a single estimate  $\hat{\boldsymbol{w}}$ . For the second term in Eq. (4), we can approximate it as  $\sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \frac{p_l}{2} \| \boldsymbol{U}_l \|_2^2 + \frac{1}{2} \| \boldsymbol{u}_l \|_2^2 \right)$ . As a result, we can derive the objective as

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {G P}} := \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \frac {- \log p (\boldsymbol {y} _ {n} | \boldsymbol {x} _ {n} , \hat {\boldsymbol {w}})}{\tau} + \sum_ {l = 1} ^ {L} \left(\frac {p _ {l}}{2} \| \boldsymbol {U} _ {l} \| _ {2} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{2} \| \boldsymbol {u} _ {l} \| _ {2} ^ {2}\right), \tag {5}
$$

which is shown to have the same form as the objective function in Eq. (1) with appropriate hyperparameters for the deep GP. This suggests that our CigL can be viewed as an approximation to the deep GP using hierarchical variational inference.

# 4.2 CIGL WITH BETTER CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION

Obtaining reliable DNNs is more challenging in sparse training, and we will show why our CigL provides a solution to this problem. Bayesian methods have shown the ability to improve confidence calibration (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Ashukha et al., 2020), but they become more difficult to fit the posterior well under sparse constraints, limiting their ability to solve unreliable problems. CigL can be viewed as a Bayesian method that can improve confidence calibration by performing better posterior approximations in two ways discussed below.

On the one hand, the model is more challenging to fully explore the weight space due to sparsity constraint, while inappropriate weight values can also negatively affect the mask search. A large percentage of weights are fixed to zero, which cuts off the update routes and thus narrows the family of Bayesian proposal distributions. This makes both optimization and sampling more difficult. Since our CigL adds a hierarchical structure to the variational distributions, we have a larger family of distributions, which makes it possible to capture more complex marginal distributions and reduces the difficulty of fitting the posterior.

On the other hand, the posterior landscape changes when sparsity constraints are added, such as an increased correlation between hidden variables. In CigL, there is a stronger correlation between  $Z$  and  $W$  (shown in the Appendix C). When in a dense model, the accuracy does not change much if we randomly draw  $Z$  and use  $Z \odot W$  instead of  $W$ . However, at high sparsity like 95%, we see a significant decrease in accuracy when  $Z \odot W$  is used instead of  $W$ . Thus, in CigL, the pairings of  $Z$  and  $W$  are collected to capture the correlation, leading to a better posterior approximation.

# 4.3 CONNECTION TO DROPOUT

Our CigL can be seen as a new version of Dropout, and our random mask  $Z$  is related to the Dropout mask. Dropout is a widely used method to overcome the overfitting problem (Hinton et al., 2012; Wan et al., 2013; Srivastava et al., 2014). Two widely used types are unit dropout and weight dropout, which randomly discard units (neurons) and individual weights at each training step, respectively. Both methods use dropouts only in the training phase and remove them in the testing phase, which is equivalent to discarding  $Z$  and only using  $W$  for prediction. However, simply dropping  $Z$  can be detrimental to the fit of the posterior. Thus, MC dropout collects multiple models by randomly selecting multiple dropout masks, which is equivalent to extracting multiple  $Z$  and using one  $W$  for prediction. However, only using one  $W$  neither fully expresses the posterior landscape nor captures the correlation between  $Z$  and  $W$ . In contrast, our CigL uses multiple pairings of  $Z$  and  $W$ , which can better approximate the posterior under sparsity constraints.

# 4.4 CONNECTION TO WEIGHT AVERAGING

Our weight & mask averaging can be seen as an extension of weight averaging (WA), which averages the weights of multiple model samples to produce a single output model (Izmailov et al., 2018; Wortsman et al., 2022). Compared to deep ensembles (Ashukha et al., 2020), WA outputs only one model, which reduces the forward FLOPs and speeds up prediction. When these model samples are located in one low error basin, it usually leads to wider optima and better generalization. However, although WA can produce better generalization, it does not improve the confidence calibration (Wortsman et al., 2022). In contrast to WA, our weight & mask averaging uses masks for weighted averaging and improves the confidence calibration with similar FLOPs in the prediction.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

We perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of CigL, comparing it with the popular baseline method RigL (Evci et al., 2020). RigL is a popular sparse training method that uses weights magnitudes to prune and gradient magnitudes to grow connections.

Datasets & Model Architectures: We follow the settings in Evci et al. (2020) for a comprehensive comparison. Our experiments are based on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and ImageNet-2012 (Russakovsky et al., 2015). For model architectures, we used ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) and Wide-ResNet-22-2 (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). We repeat all experiments 3 times and report the mean and standard deviation.

Sparse Training Settings: For sparse training, we check multiple sparsities, including  $80\%$ ,  $90\%$ ,  $95\%$ , and  $99\%$ , which can sufficiently reduce the memory requirement and is of more interest.

**Implementations:** We follow the settings in (Evci et al., 2020; Sundar & Dwaraknath, 2021). The parameters are optimized by SGD with momentum. For the learning rate, we use piecewise constant decay scheduler. For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we train all the models for 250 epochs with a batch size of 128. For ImageNet, we train all the models for 100 epochs with a batch size of 64.

# 5.1 COMPARISON BETWEEN POPULAR SPARSE TRAINING METHOD

Results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We first compare our CigL and RigL by the expected calibration error (ECE) (Guo et al., 2017), a popular measure of the discrepancy between a model's confidence and true accuracy, with a lower ECE indicating better confidence calibration and higher reliability. In Figure 2, the pink and blue curves represent CigL and RigL, respectively, where the colored ares represent the  $95\%$  confidence intervals. We can see that the pink curves are usually lower than the blue curves for different sparsities  $(80\%, 90\%, 95\%, 99\%)$ , which implies that our CigL can reduce the ECE and improve the confidence calibration of the produced sparse models.

Apart from ECE value, we also compare our CigL and RigL by the testing accuracy for multiple sparsities (80%, 90%, 95%, 99%). We summarize the results for sparse ResNet-50 in Table 1. It is observed that CigL tends to bring comparable or higher accuracy, which demonstrates that CigL can simultaneously maintain or improve the accuracy.

Results on ImageNet-2012. We also compare the ECE values and test accuracy of our CigL and RigL on a larger dataset, ImageNet-2012, where the sparsity of ResNet-50 is  $80\%$  and  $90\%$ . As shown in Figure 3, the pink and blue bars represent our CigL and RigL, respectively. For the comparison of ECE values in (a), the pink bars are shorter than the blue bars, indicating an improved reliability of the sparse model produced by CigL. For the test accuracy comparison in (b), the pink and blue bars are very similar in height, implying that the accuracy of CigL is comparable to that of RigL.

# 5.2 COMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT DROPOUT METHODS

In this section, since our CigL is related to dropout methods, we compare our CigL with RigL using existing popular dropout methods, namely weight dropout (W-DP) and MC dropout (MC-DP). The comparison of test accuracy is shown in Table 2. Our CigL usually provides a comparable or higher accuracy compared to RigL. However, using weight dropout and MC dropout in RigL usually result in a decrease in accuracy. We also summarize the comparison of the ECE value between CigL and different dropout methods in Table 3. For each sparsity and architecture, we have marked in bold those cases where the ECE value is significantly reduced ( $\geq 15\%$  reduction compared to RigL). Our CigL are always bolded, indicating its ability to reduce ECE value and increase reliability in sparse training. But RigL + weight dropout does not significantly reduce ECE values in almost all cases and RigL + MC dropout also does not improve the calibration in highly sparse cases (99% sparsity).

# 5.3 COMPARISON BETWEEN OTHER CALIBRATION METHODS

In this section, we compare our CigL with existing popular calibration methods, including mixup (Zhang et al., 2017), temperature scaling (TS) (Guo et al., 2017), and label smoothing (LS) (Szegedy et al., 2016). The testing ECE are depicted in Figure 4, where the pink and blue polygons represent CigL and other calibration methods, respectively. We can see that CigL usually gives smaller polygons, indicating a better confidence calibration.

# 5.4 ABLATION STUDIES

We do ablation studies to demonstrate the importance of each component in our CigL, where we train sparse networks using our CigL without random masks (CigL w/o RM) and CigL without weight & mask averaging (CigL w/o WMA), respectively. In CigL w/o RM, we search for sparse topologies using only the deterministic mask. In CigL w/o WMA, we collect multiple model samples and use prediction averaging during testing. Figures 5(a)-(b) show the effect of random masks on the test accuracy and ECE values, where the blue, green, and pink bars represent RigL, CigL w/o

Compared to (a)-(b) CigL w/o RM and (c)-(d) CigL w/o WMA, CigL more consistently produces sparse models with low ECE values and high accuracy.  
(c) Test accuracy (WMA)

RM, and CigL, respectively. We can see that if we remove the random mask, we can still obtain an improvement in accuracy compared to RigL. However, the ECE values do not decrease as much as CigL, indicating that the CigL w/o RM is not as effective as CigL in improving the confidence calibration. Figures 5(c)-(d) further show the effect of weight & mask averaging. We can see that without using weight & mask averaging, the accuracy decreases and the ECE value increases in high sparsity such as  $95\%$  and  $99\%$ , which demonstrates the importance of weight & mask averaging in sparsity training.

# 6 DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION

We provide the first comprehensive study on the reliability of sparse training and find that sparse training exacerbates the over-confidence problem of DNNs. We then develop a new sparse training method, CigL, to produce more reliable sparse models, which can simultaneously maintain or even improve accuracy with only a slight increase in computational and storage burden. Our CigL utilizes two masks, including a deterministic mask and a random mask, which allows the sparse model to better explore the weight space. Then, we design weight & mask averaging method to combine multiple sparse weights and random masks into a single model with improved reliability. We prove that CigL can be viewed as a hierarchical variational approximation to the probabilistic deep Gaussian process. Experiments results on multiple benchmark datasets, model architectures, and sparsities show that our CigL reduces ECE values by up to  $47.8\%$  with comparable or higher accuracy.

One phenomenon we find worth discussing is the double descent in reliability of sparse training. Nakkiran et al. (2021) first observed this double descent phenomenon in DNNs, where as the model size, data size, or training time increases, the performance of the model first improves, then gets worse, and then improves again. Consistent with the previous definition, we consider sparsity and reliability as the measures of model size and performance, respectively. Then, as shown in the Figure 1 (c), as the sparsity decreases (model size increases), the reliability (model performance) gets better, then gets worse, and then gets better again. To explain this phenomenon, we divide sparsity into four phases from left  $(99.9\%)$  to right  $(0\%)$ . (a) The sparse model starts as a poor model, which is too sparse to learn the data well (low reliability & accuracy). (b) It gradually becomes equivalent to a shallow model that can learn some patterns but is not flexible enough to learn all the data well (high reliability & moderate level of accuracy). (c) Then, it moves to a sparse deep model that can accommodate complex patterns but suffers from poor exploration (low reliability & high accuracy). (d) Finally, it reaches a dense deep model with over-confidence issues (moderate level of reliability & high accuracy). It is observed that at around  $95\%$  sparsity, the sparse model can achieve comparable accuracy and high sparsity at the same time, which makes it important in practical applications. However, the ECE value is at the peak of the double-descent curve at this point, which implies that the reliability of the sparse model is at a low level. Thus, our CigL smoothes the double descent curve and produce reliable models on those important high sparsity levels.
