# ABSTRACT

Although chain-of-thought prompting has shown impressive results on many natural language reasoning tasks, it often performs poorly on tasks which need to solve problems harder than the demonstration examples. To tackle such easy-to-hard generalization issues, we propose a novel prompting strategy, least-to-most prompting. It is implemented through two stage prompting: reducing a complex problem into a list of subproblems, and then sequentially solving these subproblems, whereby solving a given subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. Experiments on symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization and math reasoning show that least-to-most prompting can generalize to the examples that are harder than those seen in the prompt, and outperform chain-of-thought prompting by a large margin. A notable result is that the GPT-3 code-davinci-002 model with least-to-most-prompting solves the SCAN benchmark regardless of splits (such as length split) with an accuracy of  $99.7\%$  using 14 examples versus an accuracy of  $16.2\%$  by chain-of-thought prompting, and neural-symbolic models in the literature specialized for solving SCAN are trained with the full training set of more than 15,000 examples.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Despite the great success of deep learning in the past decade, there still remain huge differences between human intelligence and machine learning: (1) Given a new task, humans usually can learn to accomplish it from only a few demonstration examples, while machine learning requires a large amount of labeled data for model training; (2) Humans can clearly explain the underlying rationale for their predictions or decisions, while machine learning is essentially a black box; (3) Humans can solve problems more difficult than any they have seen before, while for machine learning, examples in training and testing are typically at the same level of difficulty.

The recently proposed chain-of-thought prompting approach (Wei et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022) has taken a significant step for narrowing the gap between human intelligence and machine intelligence. It combines the idea of natural language rationales (Ling et al., 2017; Cobbe et al., 2021) with few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020). By further integrating with the self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022b) rather than using the typical greedy decoding, few-shot chain-of-thought prompting largely outperforms the state-of-the-art results in the literature on many challenging natural language processing tasks obtained from specially designed neural models trained with hundreds of times more annotated examples, while being fully interpretable.

However, chain-of-thought prompting has a key limitation—it often performs poorly on tasks that require generalization of solving problems harder than those demonstration examples, such as compositional generalization (Lake & Baroni, 2018; Keysers et al., 2020). To tackle such easy-to-hard generalization issues, we propose least-to-most prompting. It consists of two stages: first reducing a complex problem into a list of easier subproblems, and then sequentially solving these subproblems, whereby solving a given subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. Both stages are implemented by few-shot prompting. So there is no training or finetuning in either stage. An example usage of least-to-most prompting is illustrated in Figure 1.

The term least-to-most prompting is borrowed from educational psychology (Libby et al., 2008), where it is used to denote the technique of using a progressive sequence of prompts to help a student to learn a new skill. Here we apply the technique for teaching humans to teach language models.

Empirical results on symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning show that least-to-most prompting can indeed generalize to problems harder than those demonstrated.

Figure 1: Least-to-most prompting solves a math word problem in two stages: (1) query the language model to reduce the problem into two subproblems; (2) query the language model to sequentially solve the subproblems. The answer to the second subproblem is built on the answer to the first subproblem. The demonstration examples for each stage's prompt is omitted in this illustration.

# 2 LEAST-TO-MOST PROMPTING

Least-to-most prompting teaches language models how to solve a complex problem by reducing it to a series of subproblems with increasing complexity to solve. It consists of two stages:

1. The first stage is for problem reduction. The prompt in this stage contains constant examples that demonstrate the reduction followed by the specific question to be reduced.  
2. The second stage is for problem solving—sequentially solve the generated subproblems from the first stage. The prompt in this stage consists of three parts: (1) constant examples demonstrating how subproblems are solved; (2) a potentially empty list of previously answered subquestions and generated solutions, and (3) the question to be answered next.

In the example shown in Figure 1, the language model is first asked to reduce the original problem into subproblems. The prompt that is passed to the model consists of examples that illustrates how to reduce complex problems (which is not shown in the figure) followed by the specific problem to be reduced (as shown in the figure). The language model's answer reflects that the original problem can be solved via solving an intermediate problem "How long does each trip take?"

In the next phase, we ask the language model to sequentially solve the subproblems from the former problem reduction stage. The original problem is appended as the final subproblem. The solving starts from passing to the language model a prompt that consists of examples that illustrates how problems are solved (not shown in the figure) followed by the first subproblem "How long does each trip take?" We then take the answer generated by the language model ("... each trip takes 5

minutes.") and construct the next prompt by appending the generated answer to the previous prompt followed by the next subproblem, which happens to be original problem in this example. The new prompt is then passed back to the language model, which returns the final answer.

Least-to-most prompting can be combined with other prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) and self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022b) but not necessary. In addition, for some tasks, the two stages in least-to-most prompting could be merged to form a single-pass prompting.

# 3 RESULTS

We present least-to-most prompting results for symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning tasks. We start with a symbolic manipulation task since it is quite simple while being able to illustrate the key ideas in least-to-most prompting. We will see that language models seem understanding recursion by only observing a two-step demonstration.

# 3.1 SYMBOLIC MANIPULATION

Consider the so-called last-letter-concatenation task (Wei et al., 2022). The input is a list of words, and the output is the concatenation of the last letters of the words in the list. For example, "thinking, machine" outputs "ge" since the last letter of "thinking" is "g" and the last letter of "machine" is "e". The technique that we present for solving last-letter-concatenation task can be directly adapted to solve other symbolic manipulation tasks such as reversing a list of words.

The experiment setup is as follows: (1) only two demonstration examples are provided; (2) the lists used in demonstration contain at most three words, while the test lists contain four or more words. This task is trivial for humans, but it is supposed to be impossible for even most advanced statistical learning methods: (1) models trained with two examples are not expected to generalize; (2) moreover, the length-based train-test split requires out-of-distribution generalization, while machine learning is essentially built on the assumption of identical distributions (Vapnik, 1999).

Table 1: Chain-of-thought (left column) and least-to-most (right column) prompts for the last-letterconcatenation task. Note that in least-to-most, the second example is built on the first one.  

<table><tr><td>Chain-of-thought prompting</td><td>Least-to-most prompting (solving stage)</td></tr><tr><td>Q: “think, machine”A: The last letter of “think” is “k”. The last letter of “machine” is “e”. Concatenating “k”, “e” leads to “ke”. So, “think, machine” outputs “ke”.</td><td>Q: “think, machine”A: The last letter of “think” is “k”. The last letter of “machine” is “e”. Concatenating “k”, “e” leads to “ke”. So, “think, machine” outputs “ke”.</td></tr><tr><td>Q: “learning, reasoning, generalization”A: The last letter of “learning” is “g”. The last letter of “reasoning” is “g”. The last letter of “generalization” is “n”. Concatenating “g”, “g”, “n” leads to “ggn”. So, “learning, reasoning, generalization” outputs “ggn”.</td><td>Q: “think, machine, learning”A: “think, machine” outputs “ke”. The last letter of “learning” is “g”. Concatenating “ke”, “g” leads to “keg”. So, “think, machine, learning” outputs “keg”.</td></tr></table>

Least-to-most prompting. We need to define the implementations for both the problem reduction and solving stages. Subproblems here are simply the prefixes of the list. For example, given a list "think, machine, learning, reasoning", the least-to-most subproblems are: "think, machine", "think, machine, learning" and "think, machine, learning, reasoning". Such a trivial reduction can be done straightforwardly by a manually written script or prompting language models with several demonstrations. The constant prompt context for solving the subproblems is presented in the right column of Table 1. Essentially, this prompt teaches a language model to build answers to new problems using the answers to previously solved problems: (1) the list in the second example ("think, machine, learning") is an extension of the list in the first example ("think, machine") rather than an independent example; (2) the answer to the second example copies the output from the first one by

starting with a sentence that says "think, machine" outputs "ke". Although this copy function is trivial for humans, we found that not all language models (e.g. text-curie-001 in GPT-3) are able to consistently support copying, which may cause least-to-most prompting to fail.

Q: "mind, emerge"

A: The last letter of "mind" is "d". The last letter of "emerge" is "e". Concatenating "d", "e" leads to "de". So, "mind, emerge" outputs "de".

Q: "mind, emerge, from"

A: “mind, emerge” outputs “de”. The last letter of “from” is “m”. Concatenating “de”, “m” leads to “dem”. So, “mind, emerge, from” outputs “dem”.

Q: "mind, emerge, from, neuron"

A: "mind, emerge, from" outputs "dem". The last letter of "neuron" is "n". Concatenating "dem", "n" leads to "denn". So, "mind, emerge, from, neuron" outputs "denn".

Table 3: Accuracies of different prompting methods with code-davinci-002 on the last-letterconcatenation task with the length of lists increasing from 4 to 12. All the methods are 2-shot.  

<table><tr><td>Method</td><td>L = 4</td><td>L = 6</td><td>L = 8</td><td>L = 10</td><td>L = 12</td></tr><tr><td>Standard prompting</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Chain-of-Thought</td><td>89.4</td><td>75.0</td><td>51.8</td><td>39.8</td><td>33.6</td></tr><tr><td>Least-to-Most</td><td>94.0</td><td>88.4</td><td>83.0</td><td>76.4</td><td>74.0</td></tr></table>

Results. Standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting are used as the baselines. The chain-of-thought and least-to-most prompts are listed in Table 1, and for standard prompting, its prompt is formed by removing the rationales from the chain-of-thought prompt. All the methods are 2-shot with a list of 2 words and a list of 3 words. We randomly sample words in Wiktionary<sup>1</sup> to construct testing lists with lengths varied from 4 to 12. For each given length, 500 lists are constructed. The accuracies of different methods with code-davinci-002 in GPT-3 are shown in Table 3. Standard prompting completely fails all test cases with an accuracy of 0. Chain-of-thought prompting greatly boosts the performance over standard prompting, but it still falls well behind least-to-most prompting, particularly when the lists are long. Both chain-of-thought prompting and least-to-most prompting perform worse on longer lists. However, the performance of chain-of-thought prompting drops much faster with the length increases. By adding two more examples (see Appendix A.1, the lists are still limited to contain 2 or 3 words), we obtain about 2 points higher accuracies for chain-of-thought prompting and least-to-most prompting, but the gain is diminishing when more examples are added. We also run the same promptings over text-davinci-002. We observe that when the length of lists is less than 10, text-davinci-002 is comparable to code-davinci-002. However, after the length of lists increases to 10, text-davinci-002 becomes much worse. We report these additional empirical results in Appendix A.2.

Error analysis. Although it significantly outperforms chain-of-thought prompting, least-to-most prompting is still far from achieving  $100\%$  accuracy for long lists. In Appendix A.3, we present a detailed error analysis for the results generated from code-davinci-002. We find that only very few of them are due to incorrect last letters, and most of them are concatenation errors, dropping or adding a letter. For example, given the list "gratified, contract, fortitude, blew", the model somehow drops the last letter in the concatenation of "dte" and "w", and thus predicts the outcome to be "dte" instead of "dtew". In another example "hollow, supplies, function, gorgeous", the model somehow duplicates the last letter "s" in the concatenation of "wsn" and "s", and thus the prediction becomes "wsnss" instead of "wsns". Those look somewhat reminiscent of careless mistakes from humans.

# 3.2 COMPOSITIONAL GENERALIZATION

SCAN (Lake & Baroni, 2018) is probably the most popular benchmark for evaluating compositional generalization. It requires mapping natural language commands to action sequences (Table 4). Sequence-to-sequence models perform poorly under length split where the action sequences in the training set (about  $80\%$  of the full set of over 20,000 commands) are shorter than the action sequences in the testing set. Many specialized neural-symbolic models have been proposed to solve SCAN (Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Nye et al., 2020; Shaw et al., 2021; Kim, 2021). Here we show how SCAN can be solved by least-to-most prompting with only several demonstrations.

Table 4: Example commands in SCAN and their corresponding action sequences. An agent successfully executes a natural language command by performing its corresponding action sequence.  
Table 5: Three demonstration examples taken from the least-to-most prompt for reducing a long command to a sequence of short commands.  

<table><tr><td>Command</td><td>Action Sequence</td></tr><tr><td>“look thrice after jump”</td><td>JUMP LOOK LOOK LOOK</td></tr><tr><td>“run left and walk”</td><td>TURN_LEFT RUN WALK</td></tr><tr><td>“look opposite right”</td><td>TURN_RIGHT TURN_RIGHT LOOK</td></tr></table>

Least-to-most prompting. It is implemented via two prompts: (1) command reduction prompt containing 8 examples to demonstrate how to reduce a long command to a list of short commands (see some of them in Table 5); and (2) command mapping prompt containing 14 examples to demonstrate how to map natural language commands to action sequences (see some of them in Table 6). See the full prompts in Appendix B. The demonstration examples in the command-mapping are supposed to be able to fully cover the semantics of various SCAN commands. For example, "look twice" maps to "LOOK" * 2, which illustrates how "twice" works, and "run and look twice" maps to "RUN" + "LOOK" * 2, which demonstrates the meaning of "and" and that "twice" has higher priority over "and". We use Python notation to make our prompts concise to meet the input size limit of language models (usually up to 2048 tokens). To generate the final results, we either run a postprocessing script or prompt language models to expand the Python expressions. It is straightforward to teach language models to expand Python expressions via a few demonstrations.

Q: "look opposite right thrice after walk"

A: "look opposite right thrice" can be solved by: "look opposite right", "look opposite right thrice". "walk" can be solved by "walk". So, "look opposite right thrice after walk" can be solved by: "look opposite right", "look opposite right thrice", "walk".

Q: "jump around right"

A: "jump around right" can be solved by: "jump right", "jump around right". So, "jump around right" can be solved by: "jump right", "jump around right".

Q: "look around right thrice and walk"

A: "look around right thrice" can be solved by: "look right", "look around right", "look around right thrice". "walk" can be solved by "walk". So, "look around right thrice and walk" can be solved by: "look right", "look around right", "look around right thrice", "walk".

Results. We compare least-to-most prompting with chain-of-thought prompting and standard prompting. All the prompting methods share the same example commands, but the regular prompting directly maps them to action sequences without explanations, and chain-of-thought prompting uses the same command-mapping context as least-to-most prompting but does not use command reduction. The accuracies of different prompting methods with different language models are presented in Table 8. Using code-davinci-002, least-to-most prompting achieves an accuracy of  $99.7\%$  under length split. We investigate more than 100 generated solutions which lead to correct outputs. There is no such a case where the solution is wrong while the final output is correct. A test case of least-to-most prompting is listed in Table 7. More example outputs can be found in Appendix B.3. We also test our method on all other splits and the full dataset. We find that the

Q: "jump left"

A: The output of "jump left" concatenates: the output of "turn left", the output of "jump". "turn left" outputs "TURN_LEFT". "jump" outputs "JUMP". So concatenating the output of "turn left" and the output of "jump" leads to "TURN_LEFT" + "JUMP". So the output of "jump left" is "TURN_LEFT" + "JUMP".

Q: "run and look twice"

A: The output of "run and look twice" concatenates: the output of "run", the output of "look twice". "run" outputs "RUN". "look twice" outputs "LOOK" * 2. So concatenating the output of "run" and the output of "look twice" leads to "RUN" + "LOOK" * 2. So the output of "run and look twice" is "RUN" + "LOOK" * 2.

Q: "walk opposite left"

A: The output of "walk opposite left" concatenates: the output of "turn opposite left", the output of "walk". "turn opposite left" outputs "TURN_LEFT" * 2. "walk" outputs "WALK". So concatenating the output of "turn opposite left" and the output of "walk" leads to "TURN_LEFT" * 2 + "WALK". So the output of "walk opposite left" is "TURN_LEFT" * 2 + "WALK".

Q: "jump right"

A: The output of "jump right" concatenates: the output of "turn right", the output of "jump". "turn right" outputs "TURN_RIGHT". "jump" outputs "JUMP". So concatenating the output of "turn right" and the output of "JUMP" leads to "TURN_RIGHT" + "JUMP". So the output of "jump right" is "TURN_RIGHT" + "JUMP".

Q: "jump right twice"

A: The output of "jump right twice" concatenates: the output of "jump right", the output of "jump right". "jump right" outputs "TURN_RIGHT" + "JUMP". So repeating the output of "jump right" two times leads to ("TURN_RIGHT" + "JUMP") * 2. So the output of "jump right twice" is ("TURN_RIGHT" + "JUMP") * 2.

Q: "jump right twice after walk"

A: The output of "jump right twice after walk" concatenates: the output of "walk", the output of "jump right twice". "walk" outputs "WALK". "jump right twice" outputs ("TURN_RIGHT" + "JUMP") * 2. So concatenating the output of "walk" and the output of "jump right twice" leads to "WALK" + ("TURN_RIGHT" + "JUMP") * 2. So the output of "jump right twice after walk" is "WALK" + ("TURN_RIGHT" + "JUMP") * 2.

Table 7: A test case of least-to-most prompting on SCAN. Generated with code-davinci-002. The outputs of longer commands are progressively built on the outputs of shorter commands.  
solving rate remains the same. In addition, it may be interesting to note that code-davinci-002 consistently performs better than text-davinci-002, regardless of prompting methods.  
Table 8: Accuracies (%) of different prompting methods on the test set of SCAN under length split. The results of text-davinci-002 are based on a random subset of 100 commands.

Error analysis. Under the test of length split, there are 13 failures in total from least-to-most prompting: 6 of them incorrectly interpret "twice" and "thrice" following "around", and the rest

incorrectly interpret "after" as "and". Let us show a failed examples for each category. In the example "walk opposite right twice after run around right thrice", code-davinci-002 correctly translates the expression "run around right" to ("TURN_RIGHT" + "RUN") * 4. Then it makes a mistake when applying "thrice" to this expression and produces ("TURN_RIGHT" + "RUN") * 9 instead of ("TURN_RIGHT" + "RUN") * 4 * 3 or ("TURN_RIGHT" + "RUN") * 12. In the example "run opposite left thrice after run around left twice", code-davinci-002 produces the correct translations for both sub-expressions that are connected by "after" but it combines them as if they were connected by "and". This means that the model produces ("TURN_LEFT" * 2 + "RUN") * 3 + ("TURN_LEFT" + "RUN") * 4 * 2 instead of ("TURN_LEFT" + "RUN") * 4 * 2 + ("TURN_LEFT" * 2 + "RUN") * 3. A detailed error analysis can be found in Appendix B.2.

We compare different prompting methods using the numerical reasoning subset in DROP (Dua et al., 2019). It contains 5,850 problems of which 1,862 problems are about football games. We design prompts respectively for football and non-football problems. The baseline methods include zero-shot, standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.

The prompts are listed in Appendix C.2 (for non-football problems) and Appendix C.3 (for football problems). An example in the least-to-most prompt is shown in Table 9, where the example on the left column shows how to reduce a problems to subproblems, and the example on the right column shows how the subproblems are sequentially solved. The chain-of-thought prompt is generated by merging the steps in the least-to-most prompt, and the prompt for standard prompting is generated by removing reasoning chains in the chain-of-thought prompt. All the prompting methods are 3-shot.

Postprocessing are applied to model outputs: (1) Normalize numerical answers (e.g., change  $1,234$  to 1234); (2) Re-calculate all equations with Python (e.g., change “ $123 - 22 = 100$ . So the answer is 100” to “ $123 - 22 = 101$ . So the answer is 101”); and (3) Round the predicted result to the same precision of the ground truth (e.g., if the ground truth is 16.7 and our prediction is 16.666, we consider the prediction correct). The accuracies of different methods with the GPT-3 code-davinci-002 model are listed in Table 10. We randomly pick 20 failures from least-to-most prompting and find that: (1) 4 are due to wrong problem reduction. Either the reductions are not helpful, or there is no reduction; (2) 13 are due to wrong answers to subproblems; (3) 3 are due to wrong “ground truth” (the predictions are correct). Example outputs and more results can be found in Appendix C.

We also conduct experiments on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). The results are on the last column of Table 10. The prompts and sampled results can be found in Appendix D. We expect that least-to-most prompting could outperform other prompting methods with a larger margin if these math reasoning tasks could take a split such that the test questions need more steps to solve than the

demonstration examples. In addition, we have considered a simplification for least-to-most prompting by unifying its two stages, that is, problem reducing and solving, to a single pass (see the prompt in Table 11). This reduces the inference cost but we do not observe accuracy improvements.

Q: Elsa has 5 apples. Anna has 2 more apples than Elsa. How many apples do they have together?

A: Let's break down this problem: 1. How many apples does Anna have? 2. How many apples do Elsa and Anna have together?

1. Anna has 2 more apples than Elsa. So Anna has  $2 + 5 = 7$  apples.  
2. Elsa and Anna have  $5 + 7 = 12$  apples together.

# 4 RELATED WORK

Compositional generalization. SCAN (Lake & Baroni, 2018) is a widely used benchmark to evaluate compositional generalization. Among all of its splits, length split, which requires a model to generalize to test sequences longer than training ones, is the most challenging. Prior work with good performance on SCAN mostly proposed neural-symbolic architectures (Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) and grammar induction techniques (Nye et al., 2020; Shaw et al., 2021; Kim, 2021). Chen et al. (2020) proposed the neural-symbolic stack machine, which contains a neural network as the controller to generate an execution trace for a given input, and a symbolic stack machine to execute the trace and produce the output. The execution trace consists of domain-specific primitives for sequence manipulation, which allows the machine to break down the input sentence into different components, translate them separately, and compose them together. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a framework that cooperatively learns two neural modules, a composer and a solver, to jointly learn the input structure and the symbolic grammar rules. Both Nye et al. (2020) and Shaw et al. (2021) inferred the symbolic grammar rules of SCAN, while Kim (2021) proposed to learn a latent neural grammar. While approaches with symbolic components are able to achieve  $100\%$  accuracy on SCAN (Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Nye et al., 2020; Shaw et al., 2021), they require complicated model training and grammar inference algorithms to search in a large grammar space. Another line of work on SCAN designs data augmentation schemes (Andreas, 2020; Akyurek et al., 2021; Lake, 2019). Both Andreas (2020) and Akyurek et al. (2021) construct synthetic training samples by recombining fragments occurred in different training samples, and Akyurek et al. (2021) further designs a sampling scheme that encourages the recombination model to produce rare samples. On the other hand, Lake (2019) proposed a meta training algorithm, which requires a meta-grammar space to construct training data, and the format of sampled grammars is similar to the SCAN grammar. While these data augmentation techniques improve the performance on several compositional generalization benchmarks, they fail to solve the length split of SCAN. Other prior works propose neural network architectures to improve compositional generalization, where they encourage the model to learn the word and span mapping (Russin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019), the alignment of input and output as span trees (Herzig & Berant, 2021), and the permutation equivariance of input and output words (Gordon et al., 2020). Still, these end-to-end neural networks without symbolic components do not generalize to longer test inputs. Unlike these existing work, we demonstrate that without

model architectures and symbolic components specially designed to improve compositional generalization, least-to-most prompting achieves  $99.7\%$  accuracy on any split (including length split) with only a handful of demonstration examples, and it does not require any training or finetuning.

Easy-to-hard generalization. In addition to compositional generalization, there are many other tasks where the test cases require more reasoning steps to solve than the training examples, for example, the last-letter-concatenation task where the test lists are longer than the demonstration examples. Dong et al. (2019) propose Neural Logic Machines (NLMs) for both inductive learning and logic reasoning. NLMs trained on small-scale tasks (such as small size blocks worlds) can perfectly generalize to large-scale tasks (such as larger size block worlds). Schwarzschild et al. (2021) show that recurrent networks trained to solve simple problems with few recurrent steps (such as small size mazes or chess puzzles) can solve more complex problems (such as larger size mazes or chess puzzles) by performing additional recurrences during inference. In our method, we achieve easy-to-hard generalization by reducing a complex problem into a series of easier problems.

Task decomposition. Perez et al. (2020) decompose a multi-hop question to a number of independent single-hop subquestions which are answered by an off-the-shelf question answering (QA) model. Then those answers are aggregated to form the final answer. Both question decomposition and answer aggregation are implemented by trained models. Wang et al. (2022a) conducts multi-hop QA by modeling prompts as continuous virtual tokens and progressively elicit relevant knowledge from language models via iterative prompting. Unlike these methods, our approach does not involve any training or finetuning. Moreover, the subquestions generated in least-to-most prompting are usually dependent and have to be sequentially solved in a specific order so that answers to some subquestions can be used to as building blocks to solve other subquestions. Yang et al. (2022) translate natural language questions to SQL queries by decomposing a question into a sequence of slot-filling natural language prompts corresponding to SQL clauses via a rule-based system. Wu et al. (2022) propose chaining large language model steps such that the output of one step becomes the input for the next and develop an interactive system for users to construct and modify chains. Least-to-most prompting chains the processes of problem reduction and subproblem solving.

# 5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

We proposed least-to-most prompting to enable language models to solve problems that are harder than those seen in the prompt context. It involves a top-down problem reduction process and a bottom-up problem solving process. Empirical results on symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning show that least-to-most prompting outperforms standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting by a large margin.

However, not all problems can be solved by least-to-most prompting. Some problems may not be reducible or at least not easy to reduce. For example, a math word problem which can be solved using variables and equations may not be that obvious to reduce to subproblems solvable within one arithmetic operation step. In this case, a possible workaround would be to first finetune the language model to give it knowledge of variables and equations. How to effectively combine prompting and finetuning should be a fascinating direction to explore.

Another limitation of least-to-most prompting stems from its natural language based solution construction. Natural language is expressive and generic but tends to be less precise than computer languages. For example, a learned computer program may be able to solve symbolic manipulation tasks at any length with an accuracy of  $100\%$ . So we may combine natural language and computer languages in our prompts to make them more powerful. This is just like writing a mathematical proof where both natural language texts and abstract symbol based equations are needed. In the prompt constructed to solve SCAN, we have actually used both natural language and Python notation.

Finally, prompting may not be the best way to enable large language models to reason. We can think of prompting as a one-way communication: teach a language model new skills without taking into account its response. It should be natural to extend prompting to full bidirectional conversations, which will be able to allow us to provide immediate feedback for language models such that they could learn better or faster. Least-to-most prompting can be considered as a step toward teaching language models through bidirectional conversations.
