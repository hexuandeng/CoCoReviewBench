# ABSTRACT

In this paper we propose to equip Generative Adversarial Networks with the ability to produce direct energy estimates for samples. Specifically, we propose a flexible adversarial training framework, and prove this framework not only ensures the generator converges to the true data distribution, but also enables the discriminator to retain the density information at the global optimal. We derive the analytic form of the induced solution, and analyze the properties. In order to make the proposed framework trainable in practice, we introduce two effective approximation techniques. Empirically, the experiment results closely match our theoretical analysis, verifying the discriminator is able to recover the energy of data distribution.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) represent an important milestone on the path towards more effective generative models. GANs cast generative model training as a minimax game between a generative network (generator), which maps a random vector into the data space, and a discriminative network (discriminator), whose objective is to distinguish generated samples from real samples. Multiple researchers Radford et al. (2015); Zhao et al. (2016) have shown that the adversarial interaction with the discriminator can result in a generator that produces compelling samples. The empirical successes of the GAN framework were also supported by the theoretical analysis of Goodfellow et al., who showed that, under certain conditions, the distribution produced by the generator converges to the true data distribution, while the discriminator converges to a degenerate uniform solution.

While GANs have excelled as compelling sample generators, their use as general purpose probabilistic generative models has been limited by the difficulty in using them to provide density estimates or even unnormalized energy values for sample evaluation.

It is tempting to consider the GAN discriminator as a candidate for providing this sort of scoring function. Conceptually, it is a trainable sample evaluation mechanism that – owing to GAN training paradigm – could be closely calibrated to the distribution modeled by the generator. If the discriminator could retain fine-grained information of the relative quality of samples, measured for instance by probability density or unnormalized energy, it could be used as an evaluation metric. Such data-driven evaluators would be highly desirable for problems where it is difficult to define evaluation criteria that correlate well with human judgment. Indeed, the real-valued discriminator of the recently introduced energy-based GANs Zhao et al. (2016) might seem like an ideal candidate energy function. Unfortunately, as we will show, the degenerate fate of the GAN discriminator at the optimum equally afflicts the energy-based GAN of Zhao et al..

In this paper we consider the questions: (i) does there exist an adversarial framework that induces a non-degenerate discriminator, and (ii) if so, what form will the resulting discriminator take? We introduce a novel adversarial learning formulation, which leads to a non-degenerate discriminator while ensuring the generator distribution matches the data distribution at the global optimum. We derive a general analytic form of the optimal discriminator, and discuss its properties and their relationship to the specific form of the training objective. We also discuss the connection between

the proposed formulation and existing alternatives such as the approach of Kim & Bengio (2016). Finally, for a specific instantiation of the general formulation, we investigate two approximation techniques to optimize the training objective, and verify our results empirically.

# 2 RELATED WORK

Following a similar motivation, the field of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) (Ng et al., 2000) has been exploring ways to recover the "intrinsic" reward function (analogous to the discriminator) from observed expert trajectories (real samples). Taking this idea one step further, apprenticeship learning or imitation learning (Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Ziebart et al., 2008) aims at learning a policy (analogous to the generator) using the reward signals recovered by IRL. Notably, Ho & Ermon draw a connection between imitation learning and GAN by showing that the GAN formulation can be derived by imposing a specific regularization on the reward function. Also, under a special case of their formulation, Ho & Ermon provide a duality-based interpretation of the problem, which inspires our theoretical analysis. However, as the focus of (Ho & Ermon, 2016) is only on the policy, the authors explicitly propose to bypass the intermediate IRL step, and thus provide no analysis of the learned reward function.

The GAN models most closed related to our proposed framework are energy-based GAN models of Zhao et al. (2016) and Kim & Bengio (2016). In the next section, We show how one can derive both of these approaches from different assumptions regarding regularization of the generative model.

# 3 ALTERNATIVE FORMULATION OF ADVERSARIAL TRAINING

# 3.1 BACKGROUND

Before presenting the proposed formulation, we first state some basic assumptions required by the analysis, and introduce notations used throughout the paper.

Following the original work on GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), our analysis focuses on the non-parametric case, where all models are assumed to have infinite capacities. While many of the non-parametric intuitions can directly transfer to the parametric case, we will point out cases where this transfer fails. We assume a finite data space throughout the analysis, to avoid technical machinery out of the scope of this paper. Our results, however, can be extended to continuous data spaces, and our experiments are indeed performed on continuous data.

Let  $\mathcal{X}$  be the data space under consideration, and  $\mathcal{P} = \{p\mid p(x)\geq 0,\forall x\in \mathcal{X},\sum_{x\in \mathcal{X}}p(x) = 1\}$  be the set of all proper distributions defined on  $\mathcal{X}$ . Then,  $p_{\mathrm{data}}\in \mathcal{P}:\mathcal{X}\mapsto \mathbb{R}$  and  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}\in \mathcal{P}:\mathcal{X}\mapsto \mathbb{R}$  will denote the true data distribution and the generator distribution.  $\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p}f(x)$  denotes the expectation of the quantity  $f(x)$  w.r.t.  $x$  drawn from  $p$ . Finally, the term "discriminator" will refer to any structure that provides training signals to the generator based on some measure of difference between the generator distribution and the real data distribution, which includes but is not limited to  $f$ -divergence.

# 3.2 PROPOSED FORMULATION

In order to understand the motivation of the proposed approach, it is helpful to analyze the optimization dynamics near convergence in GANs first.

When the generator distribution matches the data distribution, the training signal (gradient) w.r.t. the discriminator vanishes. At this point, assume the discriminator still retains density information, and views some samples as more real and others as less. This discriminator will produce a training signal (gradient) w.r.t. the generator, pushing the generator to generate samples that appear more real to the discriminator. Critically, this training signal is the sole driver of the generator's training. Hence, the generator distribution will diverge from the data distribution. In other words, as long as the discriminator retains relative density information, the generator distribution cannot stably match the data distribution. Thus, in order to keep the generator stationary as the data distribution, the discriminator must assign flat (exactly the same) density to all samples at the optimal.

From the analysis above, the fundamental difficulty is that the generator only receives a single training signal (gradient) from the discriminator, which it has to follow. To keep the generator stationary, this single training signal (gradient) must vanish, which requires a degenerate discriminator. In this work, we propose to tackle this single training signal constraint directly. Specifically, we consider providing an additional training signal to the generator, such that this additional signal can

- balance (cancel out) the discriminator signal at the optimum, so that the generator can stay stationary even if the discriminator assigns non-flat density to samples  
- cooperate with the discriminator signal to make sure the generator converges to the data distribution, and the discriminator retains the correct relative density information

Based on these guidelines, we propose the following adversarial learning formulation with an additional training signal to the generator,

$$
\max  _ {c} \min  _ {p _ {\text {g e n}} \in \mathcal {P}} \quad \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim p _ {\text {g e n}}} [ c (x) ] - \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim p _ {\text {d a t a}}} [ c (x) ] + K (p _ {\text {g e n}}), \tag {1}
$$

where  $c(x): \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  is the discriminator that assigns each data point a scalar cost, and  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}}): \mathcal{P} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  is some (functionally) differentiable, convex function of  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}$ . Similar to the original, the formulation has a minimax optimization objective, and can be understood as an augmented adversarial training criterion. Specifically, the first two terms are analogous to the original GAN criterion, which compute the divergence between  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}$  and  $p_{\mathrm{data}}$  based on expected cost assigned by the trainable discriminator. Effectively, this part is performing adversarial training. The second part  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  can be understood as an augmentation to the pure adversarial training, which provides a countervailing source of training signal for  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}$ . For now, the form of  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  has not been specified. But as we will see later, its choice will directly decide the form of the optimal discriminator  $c^*(x)$ .

With the specific optimization objective, we next provide theoretical characterization of both the generator and the discriminator at the global optimum.

Define  $L(p_{\mathrm{gen}}, c) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\mathrm{gen}}} [c(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\mathrm{data}}} [c(x)] + K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$ , then  $L(p_{\mathrm{gen}}, c)$  is the Lagrange dual function of the following optimization problem

$$
\min  _ {p _ {\text {g e n}} \in \mathcal {P}} K \left(p _ {\text {g e n}}\right) \tag {2}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {s . t .} & p _ {\text {g e n}} (x) - p _ {\text {d a t a}} (x) = 0, \forall x \in \mathcal {X} \end{array}
$$

where  $c(x), \forall x$  appears in  $L(p_{\mathrm{gen}}, c)$  as the dual variables introduced for the equality constraints. This duality relationship has been observed previously in (Ho & Ermon, 2016, equation (7)) under the adversarial imitation learning setting. However, in their case, the focus was fully on the generator side (induced policy), and no analysis was provided for the discriminator (reward function).

In order to characterize  $c^*$ , we first expand the set constraint on  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}$  into explicit equality and inequality constraints:

$$
\min  _ {p _ {\text {g e n}}} K (p _ {\text {g e n}})
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l l} \text {s . t .} & p _ {\text {g e n}} (x) - p _ {\text {d a t a}} (x) = 0, \forall x \end{array}
$$

$$
- p _ {\text {g e n}} (x) \leq 0, \forall x \tag {3}
$$

$$
\sum_ {x \in \mathcal {X}} p _ {\text {g e n}} (x) - 1 = 0.
$$

Notice that  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  is a convex function of  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x)$  by definition, and both the equality and inequality constraints are affine functions of  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x)$ . Thus, problem (2) is a convex optimization problem. What's more, since (i)  $\mathrm{dom}_K$  is open, and (ii) there exists a feasible solution  $p_{\mathrm{gen}} = p_{\mathrm{data}}$  to (3), by the refined Slater's condition (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004, page 226), we can further verify that strong duality holds for (3). With strong duality, a typical approach to characterizing the optimal solution is to apply the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which gives rise to this theorem:

Proposition 3.1. By the KKT conditions of the convex problem (3), at the global optimum, the optimal generator distribution  $p_{gen}^{*}$  matches the true data distribution  $p_{data}$ , and the optimal discriminative

inator  $c^* (x)$  has the following form:

$$
c ^ {*} (x) = - \frac {\partial K (p _ {g e n})}{\partial x} \bigg | _ {p _ {g e n} = p _ {d a t a}} - \lambda^ {*} + \mu^ {*} (x), \forall x \in \mathcal {X},
$$

$$
w h e r e \quad \mu^ {*} (x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 0, & p _ {d a t a} (x) > 0 \\ u _ {x}, & p _ {d a t a} (x) = 0 \end{array} , \right. \tag {4}
$$

$$
\lambda^ {*} \in \mathbb {R}, i s a n u n d e r - d e t e r m i n e d r e a l n u m b e r i n d e p e n d e n t o f x,
$$

$$
u _ {x} \in \mathbb {R} _ {+}, i s \text {a n u d e r - d e t e r m i n e d n o n - n e g a t i v e r e a l n u m b e r}.
$$

The detailed proof of proposition 3.1 is provided in appendix A.1. From (4), we can see the exact form of the optimal discriminator depends on the term  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$ , or more specifically its gradient. But, before we instantiate  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  with specific choices and show the corresponding forms of  $c^* (x)$ , we first discuss some general properties of  $c^* (x)$  that do not depend on the choice of  $K$ .

Weak Support Discriminator. As part of the optimal discriminator function, the term  $\mu^{*}(x)$  plays the role of support discriminator. That is, it tries to distinguish the support of the data distribution, i.e.  $\mathrm{SUPP}(p_{\mathrm{data}}) = \{x \in \mathcal{X} \mid p_{\mathrm{data}}(x) > 0\}$ , from its complement set with zero-probability, i.e.  $\mathrm{SUPP}(p_{\mathrm{data}})^{\complement} = \{x \in \mathcal{X} \mid p_{\mathrm{data}}(x) = 0\}$ . Specifically, for any  $x \in \mathrm{SUPP}(p_{\mathrm{data}})$  and  $x' \in \mathrm{SUPP}(p_{\mathrm{data}})^{\complement}$ , it is guaranteed that  $\mu^{*}(x) \leq \mu^{*}(x')$ . However, because  $\mu^{*}(\cdot)$  is under-determined, there is nothing preventing the inequality from degenerating into an equality. Therefore, we name it the weak support discriminator. But, in all cases,  $\mu^{*}(\cdot)$  assigns zero cost to all data points within the support. As a result, it does not possess any fine-grained density information inside of the data support. It is worth pointing out that, in the parametric case, because of the smoothness and the generalization properties of the parametric model, the learned discriminator may generalize beyond the data support.

Global Bias. In (4), the term  $\lambda^{*}$  is a scalar value shared for all  $x$ . As a result, it does not affect the relative cost among data points, and only serves as a global bias for the discriminator function.

Having discussed general properties, we now consider some specific cases of the convex function  $K$ , and analyze the resulting optimal discriminator  $c^*(x)$  in detail.

1. First, let us consider the case where  $K$  is the negative entropy of the generator distribution, i.e.  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}}) = -H(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$ . Taking the derivative of the negative entropy w.r.t.  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x)$ , we have

$$
c _ {\text {e n t}} ^ {*} (x) = - \log p _ {\text {d a t a}} (x) - 1 - \lambda^ {*} + \mu^ {*} (x), \forall x \in \mathcal {X}, \tag {5}
$$

where  $\mu^{*}(x)$  and  $\lambda^{*}$  have the same definitions as in (4).

Up to a constant, this form of  $c_{\mathrm{ent}}^* (x)$  is exactly the energy function of the data distribution  $p_{\mathrm{data}}(x)$ . This elegant result has deep connections to several existing formulations, which include max-entropy imitation learning (Ziebart et al., 2008) and the directed-generator-trained energy-based model (Kim & Bengio, 2016). The core difference is that these previous formulations are originally derived from maximum-likelihood estimation, and thus the minimax optimization is only implicit. In contrast, with an explicit minimax formulation we can develop a better understanding of the induced solution. For example, the global bias  $\lambda^{*}$  suggests that there exists more than one stable equilibrium the optimal discriminator can actually reach. Further,  $\mu^{*}(x)$  can be understood as a support discriminator that poses extra cost on generator samples which fall in zero-probability regions of data space.

2. When  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{x\in \mathcal{X}}p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x)^2 = \frac{1}{2}\| p_{\mathrm{gen}}\| _2^2$ , which can be understood as posing  $\ell_2$  regularization on  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}$ , we have  $\left.\frac{\partial K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})}{\partial x}\right|_{p_{\mathrm{gen}} = p_{\mathrm{data}}} = p_{\mathrm{data}}(x)$ , and it follows

$$
c _ {\ell_ {2}} ^ {*} (x) = - p _ {\text {d a t a}} (x) - \lambda^ {*} + \mu^ {*} (x), \forall x \in \mathcal {X}, \tag {6}
$$

with  $\mu^{*}(x),\lambda^{*}$  similarly defined as in (4).

Surprisingly, the result suggests that the optimal discriminator  $c_{\ell_2}^*(x)$  directly recovers the negative probability  $-p_{\mathrm{data}}(x)$ , shifted by a constant. Thus, similar to the entropy solution (5), it fully retains the relative density information of data points within the support.

However, because of the under-determined term  $\mu^{*}(x)$ , we cannot recover the distribution density  $p_{\mathrm{data}}$  exactly from either  $c_{\ell_2}^*$  or  $c_{\mathrm{ent}}^*$  if the data support is finite. Whether this ambiguity can be resolved is beyond the scope of this paper, but poses an interesting research problem.

3. Finally, let's consider a degenerate case, where  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  is a constant. That is, we don't provide any additional training signal for  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}$  at all. With  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}}) = \mathrm{const}$ , we simply have

$$
c _ {\mathrm {c s t}} ^ {*} (x) = - \lambda^ {*} + \mu^ {*} (x), \forall x \in \mathcal {X}, \tag {7}
$$

whose discriminative power is fully controlled by the weak support discriminator  $\mu^{*}(x)$ . Thus, it follows that  $c_{\mathrm{cst}}^{*}(x)$  won't be able to discriminate data points within the support of  $p_{\mathrm{data}}$ , and its power to distinguish data from  $\mathrm{SUPP}(p_{\mathrm{data}})$  and  $\mathrm{SUPP}(p_{\mathrm{data}})^{\complement}$  is weak. This closely matches the intuitive argument in the beginning of this section.

Note that when  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  is a constant, the objective function (1) simplifies to:

$$
\max  _ {c} \min  _ {p _ {\text {g e n}} \in \mathcal {P}} \quad \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim p _ {\text {g e n}}} [ c (x) ] - \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim p _ {\text {d a t a}}} [ c (x) ], \tag {8}
$$

which is very similar to the EBGAN objective (Zhao et al., 2016, equation (2) and (4)). As we show in appendix A.2, compared to the objective in (8), the EBGAN objective puts extra constraints on the allowed discriminator function. In spite of that, the EBGAN objective suffers from the single-training-signal problem and does not guarantee that the discriminator will recover the real energy function (see appendix A.2 for detailed analysis).

As we finish the theoretical analysis of the proposed formulation, we want to point out that simply adding the same term  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  to the original GAN formulation will not lead to both a generator that matches the data distribution, and a discriminator that retains the density information (see appendix A.3 for detailed analysis).

# 4 PARAMETRIC INSTANTIATION WITH ENTROPY APPROXIMATION

While the discussion in previous sections focused on the non-parametric case, in practice we are limited to a finite amount of data, and the actual problem involves high dimensional continuous spaces. Thus, we resort to parametric representations for both the generator and the discriminator. In order to train the generator using standard back-propagation, we do not parametrize the generator distribution directly. Instead, we parametrize a directed generator network that transforms random noise  $z \sim p_z(z)$  to samples from a continuous data space  $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Consequently, we don't have analytical access to the generator distribution, which is defined implicitly by the generator network's noise→data mapping. However, the regularization term  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  in the training objective (1) requires the generator distribution. Faced with this problem, we focus on the max-entropy formulation, and exploit two different approximations of the regularization term  $K(p_{\mathrm{gen}}) = -H(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$ .

# 4.1 NEAREST-NEIGHBOR ENTROPY GRADIENT APPROXIMATION

The first proposed solution is built upon an intuitive interpretation of the entropy gradient. Firstly, since we construct  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}$  by applying a deterministic, differentiable transform  $g_{\theta}$  to samples  $z$  from a fixed distribution  $p_{z}$ , we can write the gradient of  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  with respect to the generator parameters  $\theta$  as follows:

$$
- \nabla_ {\theta} H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {z \sim p _ {z}} \left[ \nabla_ {\theta} \log p _ {\text {g e n}} \left(g _ {\theta} (z)\right) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {z \sim p _ {z}} \left[ \frac {\partial g _ {\theta} (z)}{\partial \theta} \frac {\partial \log p _ {\text {g e n}} \left(g _ {\theta} (z)\right)}{\partial g _ {\theta} (z)} \right], \tag {9}
$$

where the first equality relies on the "reparametrization trick". Equation 9 implies that, if we can compute the gradient of the generator log-density  $\log p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x)$  w.r.t. any  $x = g_{\theta}(z)$ , then we can directly construct the Monte-Carlo estimation of the entropy gradient  $\nabla_{\theta}H(p_{\mathrm{gen}})$  using samples from the generator.

Intuitively, for any generated data  $x = g_{\theta}(z)$ , the term  $\frac{\partial \log p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x)}{\partial x}$  essentially describes the direction of local change in the sample space that will increase the log-density. Motivated by this intuition, we propose to form a local Gaussian approximation  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}^i$  of  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}$  around each point  $x_i$  in a batch of samples  $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$  from the generator, and then compute the gradient  $\frac{\partial \log p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x_i)}{\partial x_i}$  based on the Gaussian approximation. Specifically, each local Gaussian approximation  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}^i$  is formed by finding the  $k$  nearest neighbors of  $x_i$  in the batch  $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ , and then placing an isotropic Gaussian distribution at their mean (i.e. maximum likelihood). Based on the isotropic Gaussian approximation,

the resulting gradient has the following form

$$
\frac {\partial \log p _ {\text {g e n}} \left(x _ {i}\right)}{\partial x _ {i}} \approx \mu_ {i} - x _ {i}, \quad \text {w h e r e} \mu_ {i} = \frac {1}{k} \sum_ {x ^ {\prime} \in \mathrm {K N N} \left(x _ {i}\right)} x ^ {\prime} \text {i s} \tag {10}
$$

Finally, note the scale of this gradient approximation may not be reliable. To fix this problem, we normalize the approximated gradient into unit norm, and use a single hyper-parameter to model the scale for all  $x$ , leading to the following entropy gradient approximation

$$
- \nabla_ {\theta} H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}}\right) \approx \alpha \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {x _ {i} = g _ {\theta} \left(z _ {i}\right)} \left(\frac {\partial \log p _ {\text {g e n}} \left(x _ {i}\right)}{\partial x _ {i}} / \left| \frac {\partial \log p _ {\text {g e n}} \left(x _ {i}\right)}{\partial x _ {i}} \right|\right) \tag {11}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is the hyper-parameter and  $\frac{\partial\log p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x_i)}{\partial x_i}$  is defined as in equation (10).

An obvious weakness of this approximation is that it relies on Euclidean distance to find the  $k$  nearest neighbors. However, Euclidean distance is definitely not the correct metric to use when the effective dimension becomes very high.

# 4.2 VARIATIONAL LOWER BOUND ON THE ENTROPY

Another approach we consider relies on defining and maximizing a variational lower bound on the entropy  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x))$  of the generator distribution. We can define the joint distribution over observed data and the noise variables as  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x,z) = p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x\mid z)p_{\mathrm{gen}}(z)$ , where simply  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}(z) = p_z(z)$  is a fixed prior. Using the joint, we can also define the marginal  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x)$  and the posterior  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}(z\mid x)$ . We can also write the mutual information between the observed data and noise variables as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} I \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (x); p _ {\text {g e n}} (z)\right) = H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (x)\right) - H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (x \mid z)\right) \\ = H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (z)\right) - H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x)\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}}(.|.))$  denotes the conditional entropy. By reorganizing terms in this definition, we can write the entropy  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x))$  as:

$$
H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (x)\right) = H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (z)\right) - H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x)\right) + H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (x \mid z)\right) \tag {13}
$$

Since we aim only to maximize  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x))$ , the term  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x \mid z))$  can be dropped, because this conditional entropy is a constant when  $x$  is a deterministic function of  $z$ .  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}}(z))$  is also assumed to be fixed a priori. Hence, we can maximize  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x))$  by minimizing the conditional entropy:

$$
H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x)\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim p _ {\text {g e n}} (x)} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {z \sim p _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x)} \left[ - \log p _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x) \right] \right] \tag {14}
$$

Optimizing this term is still problematic, because (i) we do not have access to the posterior  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}(z \mid x)$ , and (ii) we cannot sample from it. Therefore, we instead minimize a variational upper bound defined by an approximate posterior  $q_{\mathrm{gen}}(z \mid x)$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} H \left(p _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x)\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim p _ {\text {g e n}} (x)} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {z \sim p _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x)} \left[ - \log q _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x) \right] + \mathrm {K L} \left(q _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x) \| p _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x)\right) \right] \\ \leq \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim p _ {\mathrm {g e n}} (x)} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {z \sim p _ {\mathrm {g e n}} (z | x)} \left[ - \log q _ {\mathrm {g e n}} (z \mid x) \right] \right] \tag {15} \\ = \mathcal {L} \left(q _ {\text {g e n}}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

We can also rewrite the variational upper bound as:

$$
\mathcal {L} \left(q _ {\text {g e n}}\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {x, z \sim p _ {\text {g e n}} (x, z)} \left[ - \log q _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {z \sim p _ {\text {g e n}} (z)} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {x \sim p _ {\text {g e n}} (x \mid z)} \left[ - \log q _ {\text {g e n}} (z \mid x) \right] \right], \tag {16}
$$

which can be optimized efficiently with standard back-propagation and Monte Carlo integration of the relevant expectations based on independent samples drawn from the joint  $p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x,z)$ . By minimizing this upper bound on the conditional entropy  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}}(z\mid x))$ , we are effectively maximizing a variational lower bound on the entropy  $H(p_{\mathrm{gen}}(x))$ .

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we verify our theoretical results empirically on several synthetic and real datasets. We focus on the entropy-regularized instantiation of our proposed Energy GAN formulation (EGAN-Ent) with the two entropy approximations described in Sections 4. In particular, we evaluate whether the discriminator can capture the density information (in the energy), while making sure the generator distribution matches the data distribution.

# 5.1 SYNTHETIC LOW-DIMENSIONAL DATA

First, we consider three synthetic datasets in 2-dimensional space, which are drawn from three different distributions: (i) Mixture of 4 Gaussians with equal mixture weights, (ii) Mixture of 200 Gaussians arranged as two spirals (100 components each spiral), and (iii) Mixture of 2 Gaussians with highly biased mixture weights,  $P(c_{1}) = 0.9$ ,  $P(c_{2}) = 0.1$ . We visualize the ground truth energy function of these distributions along with 100K training samples in Figure 1. Since the data

lies in 2-dimensional space, we can easily visualize both the learned generator (by drawing samples) and the discriminator for direct comparison and evaluation. We evaluate here the EGAN-Ent model using both approximations: the nearest-neighbor based approximation (EGAN-Ent-NN) and the variational-inference based approximation (EGAN-Ent-VI) and (EGAN-Ent-VI), and compare them with two baselines: the original GAN and the energy based GAN with no regularization (EGAN-Const).

Experiment results are summarized in Figure 2 for baseline models, and 3 for the proposed models. As we can see, all four models can generate perfect samples. However, for the discriminator, both GAN and EGAN-Const lead to degenerate solution, assigning flat energy inside the empirical data support. In comparison, EGAN-Ent-VI and EGAN-Ent-NN clearly capture the density information, though to different degrees. Specifically, on the equal weighted Gaussian mixture and the two spirals mixture datasets, EGAN-Ent-NN tends to give more accurate but slightly conservative solutions compared to EGAN-Ent-VI. However, on the biased weighted Gaussian mixture dataset, EGAN-Ent-VI actually fails to capture the correct mixture weights of the two modes, incorrectly assigning lower energy to the mode with lower probability (smaller weight). In contrast, EGAN-Ent-NN perfectly captures this bias in mixture weight, and obtains a smooth contour as in the other two cases.

It turns out this performance difference between EGAN-Ent-VI and EGAN-Ent-NN clearly reveals the training dynamics of the proposed formulation, and the limitation of the variational inference based approximation. Due to space considerationsn, we refer interested readers to the appendix B.1.

# 5.2 RANKING NIST DIGITS

In this experiment, we verify that the results in synthetic datasets can translate into data with higher dimensions. While visualizing the learned energy function is not feasible in high-dimensional data, we can still verify if the energy function learns the relative densities by inspecting the ranking of samples according to their assigned energies. We train on  $28 \times 28$  images of a single handwritten digit from the NIST dataset. We compare investigate the ability our EGAN-Ent-NN model, an EGAN-Const model and a GAN model on ranking 1000 images, where the first half are generated samples and the second one are test images. Figures 4 and Figure 5 show the top and bottom ranked images respectively for each model. We also show in Figure 7 the mean of all training samples, so we can get sense of what is the most common (highest density) style of the digit 1. We can notice that all of the top-ranked images by EGAN-Ent-NN look similar to the mean sample. In addition, the lowest-ranked images are clearly different from the mean image, with high rotation degrees, or a different thickness level. We do not see such clear distinction in the other models. We provide in the appendix the full set of ranked images.

# 5.3 SAMPLE QUALITY ON NATURAL IMAGE DATASETS

In this last set of experiments, we evaluate the visual quality of samples generated by our model in two datasets of natural images, namely CIFAR-10 and CelebA. We employ here only the variational-based approximation for entropy regularization, as it can scale well to high-dimensional data. Figure 6 shows samples generated by EGAN-Ent-VI model.

We validated the quality of our CIFAR-10 samples by computing the Inception score proposed by (Salimans et al., 2016)  ${}^{2}$  . Table 1 compares the score of our EGAN-Ent-VI with the best GAN

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this paper we have addressed a fundamental limitation in adversarial learning approaches, which is their inability of providing sensible energy estimates for samples. We proposed a novel adversarial learning formulation which results in a discriminator function that recovers the true data energy. We provided a rigorous characterization of the learned discriminator in the non-parametric setting, and proposed two methods for instantiating it in the typical parametric setting. Our experimental results verify our theoretical analysis about the discriminator properties, and show that we can also obtain samples of state-of-the-art quality.
