# ABSTRACT

We give a distributed protocol with nearly-optimal communication and number of rounds for Column Subset Selection with respect to the entrywise  $\ell_1$  norm  $(k\text{-CSS}_1)$ , and more generally, for the  $\ell_p$ -norm with  $1 \leq p < 2$ . We study matrix factorization in  $\ell_1$ -norm loss, rather than the more standard Frobenius norm loss, because the  $\ell_1$  norm is more robust to noise. This loss function arises naturally in a wide range of computer vision and robotics problems, such as 3D reconstruction and structure-from-motion. In the distributed setting, we consider  $s$  servers in the standard coordinator model of communication, where the columns of the input matrix  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  ( $n \gg d$ ) are distributed across the  $s$  servers. We give a protocol in this model with  $\tilde{O}(sdk)$  communication, 1 round, and polynomial running time, and which achieves a multiplicative  $k^{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{poly}(\log nd)$ -approximation to the best possible column subset. A key ingredient in our proof is the reduction to the  $\ell_{p,2}$ -norm, which corresponds to the  $p$ -norm of the vector of Euclidean norms of each of the columns of  $A$ . This enables us to use strong coreset constructions for Euclidean norms, which previously had not been used in this context. This naturally also allows us to implement our algorithm in the popular streaming model of computation. We further propose a greedy algorithm for selecting columns, which can be used by the coordinator, and show the first provable guarantees for a greedy algorithm for the  $\ell_{1,2}$  norm. Finally, we implement our protocol and give significant practical advantages on real data sets.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Column Subset Selection ( $k$ -CSS) is a widely studied approach for rank- $k$  approximation and feature selection. In  $k$ -CSS, one seeks a small subset  $U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$  of  $k$  columns of a data matrix  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ , typically  $n \gg d$ , for which there is a right factor  $V$  such that  $|UV - A|$  is small under some norm  $|\cdot|$ .  $k$ -CSS is a special case of low rank approximation for which the left factor is an actual subset of columns. The main advantage of  $k$ -CSS over general low rank approximation is that the resulting factorization is more interpretable, as columns correspond to actual features while general low rank approximation takes linear combinations of such features. In addition,  $k$ -CSS preserves the sparsity of the data matrix  $A$ .

$k$ -CSS has been extensively studied in the Frobenius norm (Guruswami & Sinop, 2012; Boutsidis et al., 2014; Boutsidis & Woodruff, 2017; Boutsidis et al., 2008) and operator norms (Halko et al., 2011; Woodruff, 2014). A number of recent works (Song et al., 2017; Chierichetti et al., 2017; Dan et al., 2019; Ban et al., 2019; Mahankali & Woodruff, 2020) studied this problem in the  $\ell_p$  norm ( $k$ - $\mathrm{CSS}_p$ ) for  $1 \leq p < 2$ . The  $\ell_p$  norm is less sensitive to outliers, and better at handling missing data and non-Gaussian noise, than the Frobenius norm, leading to improved performance in computer vision and image processing tasks, such as structure-from-motion (Ke & Kanade, 2005) and image denoising (Yu et al., 2012).

Despite the flurry of recent work on  $k$ -CSS $_p$ , this problem remains largely unexplored in the distributed setting. This should be contrasted to Frobenius norm column subset selection and low rank approximation, for which a number of results in the distributed model are known, see, e.g., Altschuler et al. (2016b); Balcan et al. (2015; 2016); Boutsidis et al. (2016). We consider a widely applicable model in the distributed setting, where  $s$  servers communicate to a central coordinator via 2-way channels. This model can simulate arbitrary point-to-point communication by having the coordinator

Figure 1: An overview of the proposed protocol for distributed  $k$ -CSS $_p$  in the column partition model. Step 1: Server  $i$  applies a dense  $p$ -stable sketching matrix  $S$  to reduce the row dimension of the data matrix  $A_i$ .  $S$  is shared between the servers. Step 2: Server  $i$  constructs a strong coreset for its sketched data matrix  $SA_i$  and sends the coreset  $SA_i T_i$  to the coordinator, as well as the corresponding unsketched columns  $A_i T_i$ . Step 3: The coordinator concatenates the  $SA_i T_i$  column-wise, and applies  $k$ -CSS $_{p,2}$  to the concatenated columns and computes the set of indices of the selected columns. Step 4: The coordinator concatenates  $A_i T_i$  column-wise. Step 5: The coordinator recovers the set of selected columns  $A_I$  on the concatenation of  $A_i T_i$ 's through previously computed indices.

forward a message from one server to another; this increases the total communication by a factor of 2 and an additive  $\log s$  bits per message to identify the destination server.

We consider the column partition model, in which each column of  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  is held by exactly one server. The column partition model is widely-studied and arises naturally in many real world scenarios such as federated learning (Farahat et al., 2013; Altschuler et al., 2016b; Liang et al., 2014). In the column partition model, we typically have  $n \gg d$ , i.e.,  $A$  has many more columns than rows. Hence, we desire a protocol for distributed  $k$ - $\mathrm{CSS}_p$  that has a communication cost that is only logarithmic in the large dimension  $n$ , as well as fast running time. In addition, it is important that our protocol only uses a small constant number of communication rounds (meaning back-and-forth exchanges between servers and the coordinator). Indeed, otherwise, the servers and coordinator would need to interact more, making the protocol sensitive to failures in the machines, e.g., if they go offline. Further, a 1-round protocol can naturally be adapted to an single pass streaming algorithm when we consider applications with limited memory and access to the data. In fact, our protocol can be easily extended to yield such a streaming algorithm<sup>1</sup>.

In the following, we denote the best rank- $k$  approximation error for  $A$  in  $\ell_p$  norm by  $\mathbf{OPT} := \min_{\mathrm{rank-k}} A_k |A - A_k|_p$ . Since general rank- $k$  approximation in  $\ell_1$  norm is NP hard (Gillis & Vavasis, 2015), we follow previous work and consider bi-criteria  $k$ -CSS algorithms which obtain polynomial runtime. Instead of outputting exactly  $k$  columns, such algorithms return a subset of  $\tilde{O}(k)$  columns of  $A$ , suppressing logarithmic factors. It is known that the best approximation factor to  $\mathbf{OPT}$  that can be obtained through the span of a column subset of size  $\widetilde{O}(k)$  is  $\Omega(k^{1/2 - \gamma})$  for  $p = 1$  (Song et al., 2017) and  $\Omega(k^{1/p - 1/2 - \gamma})$  for  $p \in (1, 2)$  (Mahankali & Woodruff, 2020), where  $\gamma$  is an arbitrarily small constant.

# 1.1 PREVIOUS APPROACHES TO  $k$ -CSS $_p$  IN THE DISTRIBUTED SETTING

If one only wants to obtain a good left factor  $U$ , and not necessarily a column subset of  $A$ , in the column partition model, one could simply sketch the columns of  $A_i$  by applying an oblivious sketching matrix  $S$  on each server. Each server sends  $A_i \cdot S$  to the coordinator. The coordinator then computes  $\sum_{i} A_i S = AS$  to obtain  $U = AS$ . Song et al. (2017) showed that  $AS$  achieves an  $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k})$  approximation to OPT, and this protocol only requires  $\tilde{O}(sdk)$  communication,  $O(1)$  rounds and polynomial running time. However, while  $AS$  is a good left factor, it does not correspond to an actual subset of columns of  $A$ .

Obtaining a subset of columns that approximates  $A$  well with respect to the  $p$ -norm in a distributed setting is non-trivial. One approach due to Song et al. (2017) is to take the matrix  $AS$  described above, sample rows according to the Lewis weights (Cohen & Peng, 2015) of  $AS$  to get a right factor

$V$ , which is in the row span of  $A$ , and then use the Lewis weights of  $V$  to in turn sample columns of  $A$ . Unfortunately, this protocol only achieves a loose  $\tilde{O}(k^{3/2})$  approximation to OPT (Song et al., 2017). Moreover, it is not known how to do Lewis weight sampling in a distributed setting. Alternatively, one could adapt existing single-machine  $k$ - $\mathrm{CSS}_p$  algorithms to the distributed setting under the column partition model. Existing works on polynomial time  $k$ - $\mathrm{CSS}_p$  (Chierichetti et al., 2017; Song et al., 2019b; Dan et al., 2019; Mahankali & Woodruff, 2020) give bi-criteria algorithms, and are based on a recursive framework with multiple rounds, which is as follows: in each round,  $\widetilde{O}(k)$  columns are selected uniformly at random, and with high probability, the selected columns can provide a good approximation to a constant fraction of all columns of  $A$ . Among the remaining columns that are not well approximated,  $\widetilde{O}(k)$  columns are recursively selected until all columns of  $A$  are well approximated, resulting in a total of  $O(\log n)$  rounds.

A naive extension of this bi-criteria  $k$ -CSS $_p$  framework to a distributed protocol requires  $O(\log n)$  rounds, as in each round, the servers and the coordinator need to communicate with each other in order to find the columns that are covered well and select from the remaining unselected columns. To reduce this to a single round, one might consider running the  $O(\log n)$  round selection procedure on the coordinator only. In order to do this, the coordinator needs to first collect all columns of  $A$  from the servers, but directly communicating all columns is prohibitive.

Alternatively, one could first apply  $k$ -CSS $_p$  on  $A_i$  to obtain factors  $U_i$  and  $V_i$  on each server, and then send the coordinator all of the  $U_i$  and  $V_i$ . The coordinator then column-wise stacks the  $U_i V_i$  to obtain  $U \cdot V$  and selects  $\tilde{O}(k)$  columns from  $U \cdot V$ . Even though this protocol applies to all  $p \geq 1$ , it achieves a loose  $O(k^2)$  approximation to OPT and requires a prohibitive  $O(n + d)$  communication cost $^2$ . One could instead try to just communicate the matrices  $U_i$  to the coordinator, which results in much less communication, but this no longer gives a good approximation. Indeed, while each  $U_i$  serves as a good approximation locally, there may be columns that are locally not important, but become globally important when all of the matrices  $A_i$  are put together. What is really needed here is a small coreset  $C_i$  for each  $A_i$  so that if one concatenates all of the  $C_i$  to obtain  $C$ , any good column subset of the coreset  $C$  corresponds to a good column subset for  $A$ . Unfortunately, coresets for the entrywise  $\ell_p$ -norm are not known to exist.

# 1.2 OUR CONTRIBUTIONS

Our Distributed Protocol We overcome these problems and propose the first efficient protocol for distributed  $k$ -CSS $_p$  ( $1 \leq p < 2$ ) in the column partition model that selects  $\widetilde{O}(k)$  columns of  $A$  achieving an  $\tilde{O}(k^{1/p-1/2})$ -approximation to the best possible subset of columns and requires only  $\tilde{O}(sdk)$  communication cost, 1 round and polynomial time. Figure 1 gives an overview of the protocol. We note that our subset of columns does not necessarily achieve an  $\tilde{O}(k^{1/p-1/2})$ -approximation to OPT itself, although it does achieve such an approximation to the best possible subset of columns. Using the fact that there always exists a subset of columns providing an  $\tilde{O}(k^{1/p-1/2})$ -approximation to OPT (Song et al., 2017), we conclude that our subset of columns achieves an  $\tilde{O}(k^{2/p-1})$ -approximation to OPT. Recently, and independently of our work, Mahankali & Woodruff (2020) show how to obtain a subset of columns achieving an  $\tilde{O}(k^{1/p-1/2})$ -approximation to OPT itself; however, such a subset is found by uniformly sampling columns in  $O(\log n)$  adaptive rounds using the recursive sampling framework above, and is inherently hard to implement in a distributed setting with fewer rounds. In contrast, our protocol achieves 1 round of communication, which is optimal.

We make use of a strong coreset, i.e., a sampled and reweighted subset of columns of each  $A_{i}$  that approximates the cost of all potential left factors of  $A_{i}$ , by first embedding all subspaces spanned by any subset of  $\tilde{O}(k)$  columns of  $A$  from  $\ell_{p}$ -space to Euclidean space, to bypass the lack of strong coresets for the  $\ell_{p}$  norm. We denote this new norm as  $\ell_{p,2}$  norm, which is the sum of the  $p$ -th powers of the  $\ell_{2}$  norms of the columns. To reduce the error incurred by switching to the  $\ell_{p,2}$ -norm, we reduce the row dimension of  $A$  by left-multiplying by an oblivious sketching matrix  $S$  shared across servers, resulting in an overall approximation factor of only  $\tilde{O}(k^{1/p-1/2})$ . Afterwards, each server sends its strong coreset to the coordinator. The coordinator, upon receiving the coresets from each server, runs an  $O(1)$ -approximate bi-criteria  $k$ -CSS $_{p,2}$  algorithm to select the final column subset, giving an overall  $\tilde{O}(k^{1/p-1/2})$  approximation to the best column subset.

We introduce several new technical ideas in the analysis of our protocol. Our work is the first to apply a combination of oblivious sketching in the  $p$ -norm via  $p$  stable random variables and strong coresets in the  $\ell_{p,2}$  norm (Huang & Vishnoi, 2020) to distributed  $k$ -CSS. Furthermore, to show that our oblivious sketching step only increases the final approximation error by a logarithmic factor, we combine a net argument with a union bound over all possible subspaces spanned by column subsets of  $A$  of size  $\tilde{O}(k)$ . Previous arguments involving sketching, such as those by Song et al. (2017); Ban et al. (2019); Mahankali & Woodruff (2020), only consider a single subspace at a time. To obtain our optimal 1 round of communication with the optimal  $\tilde{O}(sdk)$  communication, we need a coreset which has a linear dependence in  $k$ , and we use the only known and recent one of (Huang & Vishnoi, 2020).

Theoretical Guarantees and Empirical Benefits for Greedy  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub> We also propose a greedy algorithm to select columns in the  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub> step of our protocol, and show the first additive error guarantee compared to the best possible subset  $A_S$  of columns, i.e., our cost is at most  $(1 - \epsilon) \min_V |A_S V - A|_{1,2} + \epsilon |A|_{1,2}$ . Similar error guarantees were known for the Frobenius norm (Altschuler et al., 2016b), though nothing was known for the  $\ell_{1,2}$  norm. We also implement our protocol and experiment with distributed  $k$ -CSS<sub>1</sub> on various real-world datasets. We compare the  $O(1)$ -approximate bi-criteria  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub> and the greedy  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub> as different possible subroutines in our protocol, and show that greedy  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub> yields an improvement in practice.

# 2 PROBLEM SETTING

# 2.1 NORMS AND LOW RANK APPROXIMATION

Let the data matrix be  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ , and  $A_{i*}$  and  $A_{*j}$  denote the  $i$ -th row and  $j$ -th column of  $A$  respectively, for  $i \in [d], j \in [n]$ . Let  $A_T$  be the subset of columns of  $A$  with indices in  $T \subseteq [n]$ .

**Norms.** The entrywise  $\ell_p$ -norm of  $A$  is  $|A|_p = (\sum_{i=1}^d \sum_{j=1}^n |A_{ij}|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}$ . The  $\ell_{p,2}$  norm is defined as  $|A|_{p,2} = (\sum_{j=1}^d |A_{*j}|_2^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}$ . We consider  $1 \leq p < 2$ .

rank- $k$  factorization/approximation in  $\ell_p$  norm. Given an integer  $k > 0$ , we say  $U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$ ,  $V \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$  are the left and right factors of a rank- $k$  factorization for  $A$  in the  $\ell_p$  norm with approximation factor  $\alpha$  if  $|UV - A|_p \leq \alpha \cdot \mathbf{OPT}$ .

# 2.2 THE COLUMN PARTITION MODEL

We consider a model where there are  $s$  servers, the  $i^{th}$  of which holds  $A_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n_{i}}$ , and a coordinator which initially does not hold any data. Each server talks only to the coordinator, via a 2-way communication channel. The communication cost is the total number of words transferred between the servers and the coordinator over the course of the protocol. Each word is  $O(\log (snd))$  bits. The overall data matrix  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  is  $A = [A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{s}]$  (the column-wise concatenation of the  $A_{i}$ 's). Here,  $n$  is defined to be  $\sum_{i=1}^{s} n_{i}$ . Typically, in the column partition model,  $n \gg d$ .

# 3 PRELIMINARIES FOR OUR PROTOCOL

We first note a standard relationship between the  $\ell_p$  norm and the  $\ell_{p,2}$  norm.

Lemma 1. For a matrix  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  and  $p \in [1,2)$ ,  $|A|_{p,2} \leq |A|_p \leq d^{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{2}}|A|_{p,2}$ .

# 3.1  $\ell_{p}$ -NORM OBLIVIOUS SKETCHING

We left-multiply  $A$  by an oblivious sketching matrix  $S$  with  $p$ -stable random variables so that we lose only an  $\tilde{O}(k^{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{2}})$  approximation factor when we switch to the  $\ell_{p,2}$  norm.  $p$ -stable random variables exist for  $p \in (0,2]$ . Though there is no closed form expression for the  $p$ -stable distribution in general except for a few values of  $p$ , we can efficiently generate  $p$ -stable random variables using the following method due to Chambers et al. (1976): if  $\theta \in [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$  and  $r \in [0,1]$  are sampled uniformly at random, then,  $\frac{\sin(p\theta)}{\cos^{1/p}\theta} \left( \frac{\cos(\theta(1-p))}{\ln(\frac{1}{r})} \right)^{\frac{1-p}{p}}$  follows a  $p$ -stable distribution.

The purpose of the next two lemmas is to show that we can perform oblivious sketching while preserving the costs of all possible column subsets up to logarithmic factors. We first show a lower bound on the approximation error for a sketched subset of columns,  $|SA_{T}V - SA|_{p}$ , which holds simultaneously for any arbitrary subset  $A_{T}$  of chosen columns, and for any arbitrary right factor  $V$ .

Lemma 2 (Sketched Error Lower Bound). Let  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  and  $k \in \mathbb{N}$ . Let  $t = k \cdot \text{poly}(\log(nd))$ , and let  $S \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times d}$  be a matrix whose entries are i.i.d. standard  $p$ -stable random variables, rescaled by  $\Theta(1 / t^{\frac{1}{p}})$ . Then, with probability  $1 - o(1)$ , for all  $T \subset [n]$  with  $|T| = k \cdot \text{poly}(\log k)$  and for all  $V \in \mathbb{R}^{|T| \times n}$ ,  $|A_T V - A|_p \leq |SA_T V - SA|_p$ .

Next, we show an upper bound on the approximation error of  $k$ -CSS $_p$  on a sketched subset of columns,  $|SA_T V - SA_T|_p$ , which holds for a fixed subset of columns  $A_T$  and a fixed right factor  $V$ .

Lemma 3 (Sketched Error Upper Bound). Let  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  and  $k \in \mathbb{N}$ . Let  $t = k \cdot \text{poly}(\log(nd))$ , and let  $S \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times d}$  be a matrix whose entries are i.i.d. standard  $p$ -stable random variables, rescaled by  $\Theta(1/t^{\frac{1}{p}})$ . Then, for a fixed subset  $T \subset [n]$  of columns with  $|T| = k \cdot \text{poly}(\log k)$  and a fixed  $V \in \mathbb{R}^{|T| \times n}$ , with probability 0.999, we have  $\min_V |SA_T V - SA|_p \leq \min_V O(\log^{1/p}(nd)) |A_T V - A|_p$ .

# 3.2 STRONG CORESITS IN THE  $\ell_{p,2}$  NORM

To enable sub-linear communication cost in the number  $n$  of columns, the  $i$ -th server sends the coordinator a strong coreset of columns of  $SA_{i}$ , which is a reweighted subset of the columns of  $SA_{i}$ . Such strong coresets preserve the error incurred by any rank-  $k$  projection, up to a constant factor, in the  $\ell_{p,2}$  norm.

Lemma 4 (Strong Coreset in  $\ell_{p,2}$  norm). Let  $A\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ ,  $k\in \mathbb{N}$ ,  $p\in [1,2)$ , and  $\epsilon, \delta \in (0,1)$ . Then, in polynomial time, one can find a sampling and reweighting matrix  $T$  with  $\widetilde{O}(k)\cdot \mathrm{poly}(1 / \epsilon)\cdot \log(1 / \delta)$  columns such that, with probability  $1 - \delta$ , for all rank- $k$  matrices  $U$ , if  $P_U$  is the projection onto the column span of  $U$ , the following two equivalent conditions hold:

$$
\left. \left| A T - P _ {U} A T \right| _ {p, 2} = (1 \pm \epsilon) \right| A - P _ {U} A | _ {p, 2}
$$

$$
\min  _ {\text {r a n k -} k V} | U V - A T | _ {p, 2} = (1 \pm \epsilon) \min  _ {\text {r a n k -} k V} | U V - A | _ {p, 2}
$$

$AT$  is called a strong coreset of  $A$ .

# 3.3 POLYNOMIAL TIME,  $O(1)$ -APPROXIMATE BI-CRITERIA  $k$ - $\mathbf{CSS}_{p,2}$

After server  $i$  sends a strong coreset to the coordinator, the coordinator does  $k$ -CSS on a column-wise concatenation of these coresets, in the  $\ell_{p,2}$  norm rather than the  $\ell_p$  norm. We give a polynomial time,  $O(1)$ -approximate bi-criteria  $k\text{-CSS}_{p,2}$  algorithm for  $p\in [1,2)$ .

Theorem 5 (Bicriteria  $O(1)$ -Approximation Algorithm for  $k$ - $\mathrm{CSS}_{p,2}$ ). Let  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  and  $k \in \mathbb{N}$ . There exists an algorithm that runs in polynomial time and outputs a rescaled subset of columns  $U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times \widetilde{O}(k)}$  of  $A$  and a right factor  $V \in \mathbb{R}^{\widetilde{O}(k) \times n}$  such that with probability  $1 - o(1)$ ,

$$
| U V - A | _ {p, 2} \leq O (1) \cdot \min  _ {A _ {k} r a n k k} | A _ {k} - A | _ {p, 2}
$$

Our polynomial time bi-criteria  $k$ -CSS $_{p,2}$  algorithm is based on that of Clarkson & Woodruff (2015). The main difference is that the algorithm of Clarkson & Woodruff (2015) outputs a subset with  $O(k^2)$  columns due to the usage of  $\ell_p$  leverage scores — we reduce the number of selected columns to  $\widetilde{O}(k)$  by using  $\ell_p$  Lewis weights. Details are given in Appendix C.

# 4 AN EFFICIENT PROTOCOL FOR DISTRIBUTED  $k$ -CSS<sub>p</sub>

Theorem 6 (A Protocol for Distributed  $k$ -CSS $_p$ ). In the column partition model, let  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  be the data matrix whose columns are partitioned across  $s$  servers and suppose server  $i$  holds a subset of columns  $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n_i}$ , where  $n = \sum_{i \in [s]} n_i$ . Then, given  $p \in [1,2)$  and a desired rank  $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , Algorithm 1 outputs a subset of columns  $A_I \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times t}$  and a corresponding right factor  $V \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times d}$ , where  $t = k \cdot \text{polylog}(k)$ , in polynomial time, such that with probability  $1 - o(1)$ ,

$$
\left| A _ {I} V - A \right| _ {p} \leq \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {1 / p - 1 / 2}\right) \min  _ {S \subset [ n ], | S | = k} \left| A _ {S} V - A \right| _ {p}
$$

Algorithm 1 uses 1 round of communication and  $\widetilde{O} (sdk)$  words of communication.

Algorithm 1 An efficient protocol for bi-criteria  $k$ -CSS $_p$  in the column partition model  
Initial State: Server  $i$  holds matrix  $A_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times n_{i}},\forall i\in [s]$    
Coordinator:   
Generate a dense  $p$  -stable sketching matrix  $S\in \mathbb{R}^{k\mathrm{poly}(\log (nd))\times d}$  . Send  $S$  to all servers.   
Server  $i$  ..   
Compute  $SA_{i}$  . Construct a coreset of  $SA_{i}$  under the  $\ell_{p,2}$  norm by applying a sampling and reweighting matrix  $T_{i}$  with  $O(k$  poly(log(nd)) columns. Record the columns of  $A_{i}$  selected by  $T_{i}$  Send  $SA_{i}T_{i}$  to the coordinator, along with  $A_{i}T_{i}$    
Coordinator:   
Column-wise stack  $SA_{i}T_{i}$  to obtain  $SAT = [SA_{1}T_{1},SA_{2}T_{2},\dots ,SA_{s}T_{s}]$  . Apply  $k$  -CSSp,2 on SAT to obtain a subset O of columns of the  $SA_{i}T_{i}$  with size  $O(k\cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log k))$  . Since the  $T_{i}$  are sampling matrices, this is also a subset of columns of the  $SA_{i}$  , which we can denote by SA. Finally, the coordinator can recover  $A_{I}$  since the servers sent the corresponding unsketched columns of A to the coordinator as well (in the form of  $A_{i}T_{i}$    
Coordinator:   
Send  $A_{I}$  to all servers.   
Server  $i$  ..   
Solve  $\min_V_i|A_IV_i - A_i|_p$  to obtain the right factor  $V_{i}$  .  $A_{I}$  and  $V$  will be factors of a rank $k\cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log k)$  factorization of A, where  $V$  is the (implicit) column-wise concatenation of the  $V_{i}$

Proof. Approximation Factor. In the following proof, let  $L \subset [n]$  denote the subset of indices of the optimal column subset for  $A$  in the  $\ell_p$  norm. Now, let the column-wise concatenation of the  $SA_i$  be  $SA = [SA_1, \ldots, SA_s]$ . Since the  $T_i$  are reweighting and sampling matrices, we can rewrite  $(SAT)_O$  as  $(SA)_I W$ , where  $W$  is the associated diagonal weight matrix. We thus have

\min  _ {M} | (S A T) _ {O} M - S A T | _ {p, 2} = \min  _ {M} | (S A) _ {I} W M - S A T | _ {p, 2} = \min  _ {M} | S A _ {I} M - S A T | _ {p, 2} \tag {1}
$$

Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \min  _ {V} \left| A _ {I} V - A \right| _ {p} \\ \leq \left| A _ {I} V ^ {\prime} - A \right| _ {p} \\ \leq \left| S A _ {I} V ^ {\prime} - S A \right| _ {p} \\ = \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) | S A _ {I} V ^ {\prime} - S A | _ {p, 2} \\ = \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) | S A _ {I} M - S A T | _ {p, 2} \\ = \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) | (S A T) _ {O} M ^ {\prime} - S A T | _ {p, 2} \\ \leq \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) | S A T - (S A T) ^ {*} | _ {p, 2} \\ = \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) \left| \left(I - P _ {1} ^ {*}\right) S A T \right| _ {p, 2} \\ \leq \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) \left| (I - P _ {2} ^ {*}) S A T \right| _ {p, 2} \\ \leq \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) | (I - P _ {2} ^ {*}) S A | _ {p, 2} \\ \leq \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) \left| (I - P _ {S A _ {L}}) S A \right| _ {p, 2} \\ \leq \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) \left| S A _ {L} V _ {O P T, L} - S A \right| _ {p, 2} \\ \leq \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) \left| S A _ {L} V _ {O P T, L} - S A \right| _ {p} \\ = \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) \min  _ {V} | S A _ {L} V - S A | _ {p} \\ \leq \widetilde {O} \left(k ^ {\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}}\right) \cdot \log^ {1 / p} (n d) \min  _ {V} | A _ {L} V - A | _ {p} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
V ^ {\prime} := \underset {V} {\arg \min } | S A _ {I} V - S A | _ {p}
$$

By Lemma 3

By Lemma 2, and  $S$  has  $k\cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log (nd))$  rows

By Lemma 5,  $M \coloneqq \underset{M}{\arg \min} |SA_{I}M - SAT|_{p}$

By Eq. equation 1,  $M^{\prime}:= \arg \min_{M}|(SAT)_{O}M - SAT|_{p}$

Algorithm 4 is  $O(1)$ -approximate

$$
\begin{array}{l} P _ {1} ^ {*} := \underset {\operatorname {r a n k - k p o l y} (\log k) P} {\arg \min } | (I - P) S A T | _ {p, 2} \\ P_{2}^{*}:= \operatorname *{arg  min}_{\text{rank - }k\text{poly} (\log k)P}|(I - P)SA|_{p,2} \\ \end{array}
$$

By Lemma 5

$P_{S A_{L}}$  is the projection matrix onto column span of  $SA_{L}$

$$
V _ {O P T, L} := \underset {V} {\arg \min } | S A _ {L} V - S A | _ {p}
$$

By Lemma 2

By Lemma 4

Thus, we have shown that the output  $A_{I}$  of our protocol  $A_{I}$  achieves an  $\tilde{O}(k^{1/p - 1/2})$  approximation to the best possible subset of columns.

Communication Cost. Sharing the dense  $p$ -stable sketching matrix  $S$  with all servers costs  $O(sdk \cdot \text{poly}(\log(nd)))$  communication (this can be removed with a shared random seed). Sending all coresets  $SA_i T_i$  ( $\forall i \in [s]$ ) to the coordinator costs  $\widetilde{O}(sdk)$  communication. Since each coreset contains  $\widetilde{O}(k)$  columns, sending  $A_i T_i$  for all  $i \in [s]$  to the coordinator also has a cost of  $\widetilde{O}(sdk)$  words. Finally, the coordinator needs  $\widetilde{O}(sdk)$  words of communication to send the  $\widetilde{O}(k)$  selected columns to each server. Therefore, the overall communication cost is  $\widetilde{O}(sdk)$ .

Runtime. Since generating a single  $p$ -stable random variable takes  $O(1)$  time, generating the dense  $p$ -stable sketching matrix  $S$  takes  $O(dt \cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log(nd)))$  time. Computing  $SA_{i}$  takes  $O(ndk \cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log(nd)))$  time. By Lemma 5, computing the coreset  $SA_{i}T_{i}$  takes polynomial time. The  $k$ -CSS $_{p,2}$  algorithm given in Theorem 5 takes polynomial time to find  $A_{I}$ . By Lemma 1 in Chierichetti et al. (2017), solving  $\min_{V_{i}} |A_{I}V_{i} - A_{i}|_{p}$  takes polynomial time. Therefore, the overall runtime of Algorithm 1 is (a low-degree) polynomial.

# 5 GreEDy  $k$  -CSS1,2

We propose a greedy algorithm, Algorithm 2, which performs  $k$ -CSS $_{1,2}$  by selecting the column that reduces the approximation error the most at each iteration. Our analysis is inspired by the analysis of Greedy  $k$ -CSS $_2$  for the Frobenius norm in Altschuler et al. (2016a); here we provide the first additive approximation guarantee, compared to the best possible subset of columns, for the greedy  $k$ -CSS $_{1,2}$  algorithm. We denote the set of selected columns by  $A_T$  and the set of unselected columns by  $A_{\overline{T}}$ .

Algorithm 2 Greedy  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub>  
```txt
Input: The data matrix  $A\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$  , the number of iterations  $r\leq n$    
Output: A subset of columns  $A_{T}$  from  $A$  , where  $|T| = r$ $A_{T}\gets \emptyset$    
for  $i = 1$  to  $r$  do Column  $j^{*}\gets \arg \min_{j\in A_{\overline{T}}}(\min_V|A_{T\cup j}V - A|_{1,2})$ $A_{T}\gets A_{T\cup j^{*}}$    
end for
```

Theorem 7. Let  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$  be the data matrix and  $k \in \mathbb{N}$  be the desired rank. Let  $A_S$  be the best possible subset of  $k$  columns, i.e.,  $A_S = \arg \min_{A_S} \min_V |A_S V - A|_{1,2}$ . Let  $\sigma$  be the minimum non-zero singular value of the matrix  $B$  of normalized columns of  $A_S$ , (the  $j$ -th column of  $B$  is  $B_{*j} = (A_S)_{*j} / |(A_S)_{*j}|_2$ ). Then, if  $T \subset [n]$  is the subset of columns selected by Greedy  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub>, the following holds with  $|T| = \Omega(\frac{k}{\sigma^2 \epsilon^2})$ :

$$
\min  _ {V} | A _ {T} V - A | _ {1, 2} \leq (1 - \epsilon) \min  _ {S \subset [ n ], | S | = k, V \in \mathbb {R} ^ {k \times n}} | A _ {S} V - A | _ {1, 2} + \epsilon | A | _ {1, 2}
$$

Since the error upper bound for greedy  $k$ -CSS $_{p,2}$  depends on  $|A|_{1,2}$ , it is not directly comparable to the error upper bound for the proposed  $k$ -CSS $_{p,2}$  from Subsection 3.3, which achieves a multiplicative  $O(1)$ -approximation to the best rank- $k$  approximation. We empirically compare the two versions of  $k$ -CSS $_{p,2}$  for  $p = 1$  in Section 6.

# 6 EXPERIMENTS

We implement our protocol for distributed  $k$ -CSS $_p$  in Algorithm 1, setting  $p = 1$ , which enables us to compare two subroutines on the coordinator: Regular  $k$ -CSS $_{1,2}$  from Algorithm 4 and Greedy  $k$ -CSS $_{1,2}$  from Algorithm 2. We use a commonly applied baseline for  $\ell_p$  low rank approximation (Song et al., 2019a; Chierichetti et al., 2017), rank- $k$  Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Notice we are only comparing the approximation error from our protocol against that of SVD. SVD does not output a subset of columns and has very high communication cost in a distributed setting. Comprehensive reporting of our results is given in Appendix G.

Datasets. We present a summary of the datasets used in the experiments in Table 1. We report the number of servers  $s$ , the column distribution across servers and the rank  $k$  we consider for each dataset. Synthetic-counter is a synthetic dataset where we construct a data matrix  $M \in \mathbb{R}^{(k + n) \times (k + n)}$

such that the top left  $k \times k$  submatrix is the identity matrix multiplied by  $n^{\frac{3}{2}}$ , and the bottom right  $n \times n$  submatrix has all 1's. The optimal rank-  $k$  left factor consists of one of the last  $n$  columns along with  $k - 1$  of the first  $k$  columns, incurring an error of  $n^{\frac{3}{2}}$  in the  $\ell_1$  norm and an error  $n^3$  in the squared  $\ell_2$  norm. SVD, however, will not cover any of the last  $n$  columns, and thus will get an error of  $n^2$  in both the  $\ell_1$  and squared  $\ell_2$  norms. We set  $n = 2000$  and apply i.i.d. Gaussian noise to each entry with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.01. Different values of  $k$  for synthetic-counter result in datasets of different ranks. The other datasets, bcsstk13, isolet and caltech-101 are all open-source, real-world datasets. For caltech-101, we use 5 gray scale images.

Hyperparameters. We present the hyperparameters used in the experiments in Table 2. We denote the number of rows in our 1-stable (Cauchy) sketching matrix by cauchy size, and the strong coreset size by coreset size. We have two additional hyperparameters for regular  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub>. We denote the number of rows in the sparse embedding matrix of  $\tilde{O}(k)$  rows by sketch size, and the number of non-zero entries in each column of the sparse embedding matrix by sparsity.

Setup. We run 15 trials for each experiment. We report the minimum error  $\min_V |A_T V - A|_1$  out of these trials, where  $A_T$  is the selected subset of columns and  $A$  is the data matrix, on all datasets except caltech-101. On caltech-101, since we use 5 gray images of similar but different sizes and each has a different  $\ell_1$  norm, we report the mean percentage of the minimum error  $\frac{\min_V |A_T V - A|_1}{|A|_1}$  of the 5 images.

Results. We present our empirical results in Figure 2. The distributed protocol performs better using GreEDy  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub> than REGULAR  $k$ -CSS<sub>1,2</sub> on all four datasets, and in other settings we include in the supplementary material. For bcsstk13s, the improvement is more than 20% for 60 selected columns. We also observe that the size of the 1-stable matrix and coresets makes a large difference — in the settings used for isolet and the Caltech101 images, SVD outperformed our protocol, but for the settings used in bcsstk13s and synthetic-counter, our protocol vastly outperformed SVD.
