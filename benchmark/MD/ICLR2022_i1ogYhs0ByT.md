# ABSTRACT

Multi-head attention is a driving force behind state-of-the-art transformers which achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. It has been observed that for many applications, those attention heads learn redundant embedding, and most of them can be removed without degrading the performance of the model. Inspired by this observation, we propose Transformer with a Mixture of Gaussian Keys (Transformer-MGK), a novel transformer architecture that replaces redundant heads in transformers with a mixture of keys at each head. These mixtures of keys follow a Gaussian mixture model and allow each attention head to focus on different parts of the input sequence efficiently. Compared to its conventional transformer counterpart, Transformer-MGK accelerates training and inference, has fewer parameters, and requires less FLOPs to compute while achieving comparable or better accuracy across tasks. Transformer-MGK can also be easily extended to use with linear attentions. We empirically demonstrate the advantage of Transformer-MGK in a range of practical applications including language modeling and tasks that involve very long sequences. On the Wikitext-103 and Long Range Arena benchmark, Transformer-MGKs with 4 heads attain comparable or better performance to the baseline transformers with 8 heads.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have become the state-of-the-art model for sequence processing tasks, solving many challenging problems in natural language processing and computer vision (Al-Rfou et al., 2019a; Dai et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Brown & et al., 2020; Howard & Ruder, 2018; Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Dehghani et al., 2018; So et al., 2019; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2020). These models can also transfer the learned knowledge from a pre-trained model to task that involves different data modalities and has limited supervision (Radford et al., 2018; 2019; Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). The success of transformers is rooted in the self-attention mechanism as their fundamental building blocks for modeling. (Cho et al., 2014; Parikh et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017). For each token, self-attention computes a weighted average of the feature representations of other tokens where the weight is proportional to a similarity score between each pair of tokens. This mechanism allows a token to pay attention to other tokens in the sequence and attain a contextual representation (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017). It has been shown that the representation capacity of the attention mechanism (Tenney et al., 2019) and its capability of capturing diverse syntactic and semantic relationships (Tenney et al., 2019; Vig & Belinkov, 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019a; Hewitt & Liang, 2019) is keyed to the impressive performance of transformers in practice.

# 1.1 SELF-ATTENTION

For a given input sequence  $\mathbf{X} \coloneqq [\pmb{x}_1, \dots, \pmb{x}_N]^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D_x}$  of  $N$  feature vectors, self-attention transforms  $\mathbf{X}$  into the output sequence  $\mathbf{H}$  in the following two steps:

Step 1. The input sequence  $\mathbf{X}$  is projected into the query matrix  $\mathbf{Q}$ , the key matrix  $\mathbf{K}$ , and the value matrix  $\mathbf{V}$  via three linear transformations

$$
\mathbf {Q} = \mathbf {X W} _ {Q} ^ {\top}; \mathbf {K} = \mathbf {X W} _ {K} ^ {\top}; \mathbf {V} = \mathbf {X W} _ {V} ^ {\top},
$$

where  $\mathbf{W}_Q, \mathbf{W}_K \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D_x}$ , and  $\mathbf{W}_V \in \mathbb{R}^{D_v \times D_x}$  are the weight matrices. We denote  $\pmb{Q} := [\pmb{q}_1, \dots, \pmb{q}_N]^\top$ ,  $\mathbf{K} := [\pmb{k}_1, \dots, \pmb{k}_N]^\top$ , and  $\mathbf{V} := [\pmb{v}_1, \dots, \pmb{v}_N]^\top$ , where the vectors  $\pmb{q}_i, \pmb{k}_i, \pmb{v}_i$  for  $i = 1, \dots, N$  are the query, key, and value vectors, respectively.

Step 2. The output sequence  $\mathbf{H} \coloneqq [h_1, \dots, h_N]^\top$  is then computed as follows

$$
\mathbf {H} = \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\frac {\mathbf {Q K} ^ {\top}}{\sqrt {D}}\right) \mathbf {V} := \mathbf {A V}, \tag {1}
$$

where the softmax function is applied to each row of the matrix  $(\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^{\top}) / \sqrt{D}$ . For each query vector  $q_{i}$  for  $i = 1,\dots ,N$ , an equivalent form of Eqn. (1) to compute the output vector  $h_i$  is given by

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {i} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \operatorname {s o f t m a x} \left(\frac {\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} ^ {\top} \boldsymbol {k} _ {j}}{\sqrt {D}}\right) \boldsymbol {v} _ {j} := a _ {i j} \boldsymbol {v} _ {j}. \tag {2}
$$

The matrix  $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$  and its component  $a_{ij}$  for  $i, j = 1, \dots, N$  are the attention matrix and attention scores, respectively. The self-attention computed by Eqn. (1) and (2) is called the scaled dot-product attention or softmax attention. In our paper, we call a transformer that uses this attention the softmax transformer. The structure that the attention matrix  $\mathbf{A}$  learns from training determines the ability of the self-attention to capture contextual representation for each token.

Multi-head Attention Each output sequence  $\mathbf{H}$  forms an attention head. In multi-head attention, multiple heads are concatenated to compute the final output. Let  $H$  be the number of heads and  $W^{O} \in \mathbb{R}^{HD \times HD}$  be the projection matrix for the output. The multi-head attention is defined as

$$
\operatorname {M u l t i H e a d} \left(\{\mathbf {Q} \} _ {i = 1} ^ {H}, \left. \{\mathbf {K} \} _ {i = 1} ^ {H}, \{\mathbf {V} \} _ {i = 1} ^ {H}\right) = \operatorname {C o n c a t} \left(\mathbf {H} _ {1}, \mathbf {H} _ {2}, \dots , \mathbf {H} _ {H}\right) \mathbf {W} ^ {O}. \right. \tag {3}
$$

Even though multi-head attention extends single-head attention to capture diverse attention patterns and improve the performance of transformers, it has been shown that transformers for practical tasks including sequence classification and language modeling learn redundant heads (Michel et al., 2019). These redundant heads compute similar attention mappings. Having many of them in the model limits the representation capacity of the transformer while wasting parameters, memory and computation, impeding the application of transformers to many important large-scale tasks.

# 1.2 CONTRIBUTION

We establish the correspondence between self-attention in transformer and a Gaussian mixture model and propose Transformer with a Mixture of Gaussian Keys (Transformer-MGK), a novel class of transformers that can avoid the head redundancy. At the core of Transformer-MGK is replacing the attention key  $\pmb{k}_j$  in each head by a Gaussian mixture model to allow the query  $\pmb{q}_i$ , as well as its associated token, to attend to more diverse positions in the input sequence, thereby increasing the representation of each attention head and reducing the chance of learning redundant heads. In summary, our contribution is four-fold:

1. We construct a Gaussian mixture model and show that attention scores in self-attention match posterior distribution in our model, providing a probabilistic framework to study self-attention in transformers.  
2. Under our probabilistic framework for self-attention, we introduce an additional mixture of Gaussian to model each attention key. We empirically show that this mixture of Gaussian keys (MGK) can capture a diversity of attention patterns, thus alleviating head redundancy.  
3. We extend our MGK to use with linear attentions and propose the mixture of linear keys (MLK) for efficient computation and better memory footprint.  
4. We empirically show that Transformer-MGK and Transformer-MLK are comparable or better than the corresponding baseline transformers with softmax and linear attentions while only using half the number of attention heads and reducing both model complexity measured by the number of parameters and computational cost in terms of FLOPs.

# 1.3 ORGANIZATION

We structure this paper as follows: In Section 2, we establish the connection between Gaussian mixture model and self-attention and then present our Transformer-MGK and its extensions including Transformer-MLK. In Section 3, we validate and empirically analyze the efficiency and accuracy of Transformer-MGK/MLK. We discuss related works in Section 4. The paper ends up with concluding remarks. More experimental details are provided in the Appendix.

# 2 TRANSFORMER WITH A MIXTURE OF GAUSSIAN KEYS

# 2.1 ATTENTION SCORE AS A POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION

We first consider a query  $\mathbf{q}_i \in \mathbf{Q}$  and a key  $\mathbf{k}_j \in \mathbf{K}$ . Let  $\mathbf{t}$  be a  $K$ -dimensional binary random variable having a 1-of-  $K$  representation in which a particular element  $\mathbf{t}_j$  is equal to 1 and all other elements are equal to 0. We use  $\mathbf{t}_j$  to indicate the position  $j$  of the key  $\mathbf{k}_j$ . In particular, let  $\mathbf{I}$  be the unit matrix, we model the distribution  $p(\mathbf{q}_i | \mathbf{t}_j = 1)$  by the following Gaussian distribution:

$$
p \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \mid \boldsymbol {t} _ {j} = 1\right) = \mathcal {N} \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \mid \boldsymbol {k} _ {j}, \sigma_ {j} ^ {2} \mathbf {I}\right). \tag {4}
$$

Let  $\pi_j$  be the prior  $p(\pmb{t}_j = 1)$ . Given the query  $\pmb{q}_i$ , how likely  $\pmb{q}_i$  matches the key  $\pmb{k}_j$  is given by posterior  $p(\pmb{t}_j = 1|\pmb{q}_i)$ . This posterior is computed as follows

$$
\begin{array}{l} p (\boldsymbol {t} _ {j} = 1 | \boldsymbol {q} _ {i}) = \frac {\pi_ {j} \mathcal {N} (\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \mid \boldsymbol {k} _ {j} , \sigma_ {j} ^ {2})}{\sum_ {j ^ {\prime}} \pi_ {j ^ {\prime}} \mathcal {N} (\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \mid \boldsymbol {k} _ {j ^ {\prime}} , \sigma_ {j ^ {\prime}} ^ {2})} \\ = \frac {\pi_ {j} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j} ^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j ^ {\prime}} \pi_ {j ^ {\prime}} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j ^ {\prime}} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}\right)} \\ = \frac {\pi_ {j} \exp \left[ - \left(\| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \| ^ {2} + \| \boldsymbol {k} _ {j} \| ^ {2}\right) / 2 \sigma_ {j} ^ {2} \right] \exp \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \boldsymbol {k} _ {j} ^ {\top} / \sigma_ {j} ^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j ^ {\prime}} \pi_ {j ^ {\prime}} \exp \left[ - \left(\| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \| ^ {2} + \| \boldsymbol {k} _ {j ^ {\prime}} \| ^ {2}\right) / 2 \sigma_ {j ^ {\prime}} ^ {2} \right] \exp \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \boldsymbol {k} _ {j ^ {\prime}} ^ {\top} / \sigma_ {j ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}\right)}. \tag {5} \\ \end{array}
$$

We further assume that the query  $\mathbf{q}_i$  and the key  $\mathbf{k}_j$  are normalized, and the prior  $\pi_j$  is uniform. We will justify these assumptions in our Remarks at the end of this section. We also let  $\sigma_j^2 = \sigma^2$ ,  $j = 1, 2, \ldots, K$ . Then the posterior  $p(\mathbf{t}_j = 1 | \mathbf{q}_i)$  can be written as

$$
p \left(\boldsymbol {t} _ {j} = 1 \mid \boldsymbol {q} _ {i}\right) = \frac {\exp \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \boldsymbol {k} _ {j} ^ {\top} / \sigma^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j ^ {\prime}} \exp \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \boldsymbol {k} _ {j ^ {\prime}} ^ {\top} / \sigma^ {2}\right)}. \tag {6}
$$

The right-hand side of Eqn. (6) matches the attention score given in Eqn. (2) when  $\sigma^2 = \sqrt{D}$ . Thus, we show that under right assumptions, the attention score between the query  $q_{i}$  and the key  $k_{j}$  in an attention unit of a transformer is the posterior  $p(t_{j} = 1|q_{i})$ , which indicates the responsibility that key  $k_{j}$  takes for 'explaining' the query  $q_{i}$ , which in turn decide, for example, how much a token at position  $i$  pays attention to a token at position  $j$  in the input sequence.

Remark 1 The assumption that the query  $\mathbf{q}_i$  and the key  $\mathbf{k}_j$  are normalized is realistic and not artificial. In many applications, those two vectors are normalized. Schlag et al. (2021) points out that such normalization is to avoid instability occurring during the training.

Remark 2 In practice, the prior is chosen to be uniform when there is no prior knowledge available.

# 2.2 TRANSFORMER WITH A MIXTURE OF GAUSSIAN KEYS: EACH KEY IS AGAIN A GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL

As we have seen from Eqn. (6), the key  $k_{j}$  is used to explain the query  $q_{i}$  via the posterior  $p(t_{j} = 1|q_{i})$ . Via this simple connection, each key  $k_{j}$  at position  $j$  is modelled as Gaussian distribution  $\mathcal{N}(k_j,\sigma_j^2\mathbf{I})$ . To further improve the explanation power of each key  $k_{j}$ , increase the representation of each attention head, and reducing the chance of learning redundant heads, we would like to model it as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. We refer to this model as Transformer with a Mixture of Gaussian Keys (Transformer-MGK). In particular, in Transformer-MGK we model each key  $k_{j}$  at position  $j$  as a mixture of  $M$  Gaussians  $\mathcal{N}(\pmb{k}_{jr},\sigma_{jr}^{2}\mathbf{I})$ ,  $r = 1,2,\dots ,M$ . Here we are abusing the notation a little bit and use  $k_{jr}$  and  $\sigma_{jr}^{2}\mathbf{I}$  to denote the mean and covariance matrix of the  $r^{th}$  Gaussian at position  $j$ . Let  $z$  be a  $M$ -dimensional binary random variable having a 1-of-  $M$  representation. We use  $z_{r}$  to indicate the  $r^{th}$  Gaussian in the mixture. Let  $\pi_{jr} \equiv p(z_{r} = 1|t_{j} = 1)$ , our MGK can be written as

$$
p \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \mid \boldsymbol {t} _ {j} = 1\right) = \sum_ {r} p \left(\boldsymbol {z} _ {r} = 1 \mid \boldsymbol {t} _ {j} = 1\right) p \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \mid \boldsymbol {z} _ {r} = 1, \boldsymbol {t} _ {j} = 1\right) = \sum_ {r} \pi_ {j r} \mathcal {N} \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \mid \boldsymbol {k} _ {j r}, \sigma_ {j r} ^ {2} \mathbf {I}\right). \tag {7}
$$

Similar to the derivation above, the posterior  $p(\pmb{t}_j = 1|\pmb{q}_i)$  in Transformer-MGK can be written as

$$
p \left(\boldsymbol {t} _ {j} = 1 \mid \boldsymbol {q} _ {i}\right) = \frac {\sum_ {r} \pi_ {j r} \exp \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \boldsymbol {k} _ {j r} ^ {\top} / \sigma_ {j r} ^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j ^ {\prime}} \sum_ {r} \pi_ {j ^ {\prime} r} \exp \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} \boldsymbol {k} _ {j ^ {\prime} r} ^ {\top} / \sigma_ {j ^ {\prime} r} ^ {2}\right)}. \tag {8}
$$

Furthermore, in Transformer-MGK, we relax the assumption that the queries and keys are normalized. Thus, when computing  $p(\pmb{t}_j = 1|\pmb{q}_i)$ , we compute the Gaussian kernels between the queries and keys instead of their dot products. The posterior  $p(\pmb{t}_j = 1|\pmb{q}_i)$  in Transformer-MGK is then given by

$$
p \left(\boldsymbol {t} _ {j} = 1 \mid \boldsymbol {q} _ {i}\right) = \frac {\sum_ {r} \pi_ {j r} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j r} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j r} ^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j ^ {\prime}} \sum_ {r ^ {\prime}} \pi_ {j ^ {\prime} r ^ {\prime}} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j ^ {\prime} r ^ {\prime}} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j ^ {\prime} r ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}\right)}. \tag {9}
$$

As proven in Section 2.1, this posterior corresponds to the attention score. Thus, Eqn. (9) is the formula for computing the attention score in Transformer-MGK. We compute the output vector  $\pmb{h}_i$  of the self-attention in Transformer-MGK as follows

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {i} = \sum_ {j} \left(\frac {\sum_ {r} \pi_ {j r} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j r} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j r} ^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j ^ {\prime}} \sum_ {r ^ {\prime}} \pi_ {j ^ {\prime} r ^ {\prime}} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j ^ {\prime} r ^ {\prime}} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j ^ {\prime} r ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}\right)}\right) \boldsymbol {v} _ {j}. \tag {10}
$$

# 2.3 INFERENCE AND LEARNING VIA THE EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM

Let  $\gamma_{ir} \equiv p(\pmb{z}_r = 1|\pmb{q}_i, \pmb{t}_j = 1)$ , in MGK, we apply the E-step inference in the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate this posterior given the query  $\pmb{q}_i$ . The posterior  $\gamma_{ir}$  is also known as the responsibility that the component  $\mathcal{N}(\pmb{k}_{jr}, \sigma_{jr}^2\mathbf{I})$  takes to account for the observation, which in MGK is the query  $\pmb{q}_i$ . Below we propose two approaches to estimate this responsibility.

Soft E-step Using soft E-step inference, the EM algorithm makes a soft assignment, in which each query is associated with all clusters. The responsibilities are then given by

$$
\gamma_ {i r} = \frac {\pi_ {j r} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j r} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j r} ^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {r ^ {\prime}} \pi_ {j r ^ {\prime}} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j r ^ {\prime}} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j r ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}\right)} \tag {11}
$$

At learning, the responsibilities estimated by Eqn. (11) are used to update the prior  $\pi_{jr}$ , i.e.  $\pi_{jr} = N_{jr} / N$ , where  $N$  is the number of queries and  $N_{jr} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \gamma_{ir}$ . These updated priors  $\pi_{jr}$  are then used in Eqn. (9) to compute attention scores.

Hard E-step Hard E-step performs a hard assignment of queries to key clusters, in which each query is associated uniquely with one cluster. This is similar to the  $K$ -means algorithm (Lloyd, 1982) and corresponds to the MGK at the limit when the variance parameter  $\sigma_{jr}^2$  goes to 0. Following the derivation of  $K$ -means from a Gaussian mixture model in (Bishop, 2006), Eqn. (9) becomes

$$
p \left(\boldsymbol {t} _ {j} = 1 \mid \boldsymbol {q} _ {i}\right) = \frac {\max  _ {r} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j r} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j r} ^ {2}\right)}{\sum_ {j ^ {\prime}} \max  _ {r ^ {\prime}} \exp \left(- \| \boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j ^ {\prime} r ^ {\prime}} \| ^ {2} / 2 \sigma_ {j ^ {\prime} r ^ {\prime}} ^ {2}\right)}. \tag {12}
$$

Remark 3 The hard  $E$ -step inference allows the attention score to be computed more efficiently because the priors  $\pi_{jr}$  no longer play an active role in the algorithm and can be completely ignored.

Learning via Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) In the M-step of the EM algorithm, the cluster mean  $k_{jr}$  and variance  $\sigma_{jr}^2$  can be updated as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol {k} _ {j r} ^ {\text {n e w}} = \frac {1}{N _ {j r}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \gamma_ {i r} \boldsymbol {q} _ {i}, \sigma_ {j r} ^ {2 \text {n e w}} = \frac {1}{N _ {j r}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \gamma_ {i r} \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j r} ^ {\text {n e w}}\right) ^ {\top} \left(\boldsymbol {q} _ {i} - \boldsymbol {k} _ {j r} ^ {\text {n e w}}\right) \tag {13}
$$

The M-step update in Eqn. (13) is computational costly when using transformers. In order to increase the efficiency of the model, in MGK, we fix the variance parameter  $\sigma_{jr}^2$  to be  $\sqrt{D}$  as in the standard softmax attention and make only the keys  $k_{jr}$  learnable. We also make the prior  $\pi_{jr}$  learnable parameters as one of the design options. In that case, both  $k_{jr}$  and  $\pi_{jr}$  are learned via SGD. This update via SGD can be considered as a generalized M-step (Bishop, 2006).

Design Options for Keys We follow the standard setting in the softmax transformer and make the keys  $\pmb{k}_{jr}$  a linear projection of the input  $\pmb{x}$ , i.e.  $\pmb{k}_{jr} = \pmb{x}\mathbf{W}_{k_{jr}}$ . Alternatively, we also make the keys  $\pmb{k}_{jr}$  shifted version of each other to save computation, i.e.  $\pmb{k}_{jr} = \pmb{x}\mathbf{W}_{k_j} + \pmb{b}_r$ .

# 2.4 TRANSFORMER WITH A MIXTURE OF LINEAR KEYS

The MGK can be easily extended to use with linear attentions. We call that model Transformer with a Mixture of Linear Keys (Transformer-MLK). In this section, we adopt the formulation of linear attentions from (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) to derive Transformer-MLK. Similar approach can be taken to derive Transformer-MLK when using with other linear attentions such as those in performers (Choromanski et al., 2021) and fast-weight transformers (Schlag et al., 2021). In Transformer-MLK, the Gaussian kernel in Eqn. (10) is linearized as the product of feature maps  $\phi(\cdot)$  on the vectors  $q_{i}$  and  $k_{j}$ . The associative property of matrix multiplication is then utilized to derive the following efficient computation of the attention map

$$
\boldsymbol {h} _ {i} = \frac {\sum_ {j} \sum_ {r} \pi_ {j r} \phi (\boldsymbol {q} _ {i}) ^ {\top} \phi (\boldsymbol {k} _ {j r}) \boldsymbol {v} _ {j}}{\sum_ {j} \sum_ {r} \pi_ {j r} \phi (\boldsymbol {q} _ {i}) ^ {\top} \phi (\boldsymbol {k} _ {j r})} = \frac {\phi (\boldsymbol {q} _ {i}) ^ {\top} \sum_ {j} \sum_ {r} \pi_ {j r} \phi (\boldsymbol {k} _ {j r}) \boldsymbol {v} _ {j} ^ {\top}}{\phi (\boldsymbol {q} _ {i}) ^ {\top} \sum_ {j} \sum_ {r} \pi_ {j r} \phi (\boldsymbol {k} _ {j r})}. \tag {14}
$$

Replacing  $\sum_{j}\sum_{r}\pi_{jr}\phi (\pmb{q}_i)^\top \phi (\pmb{k}_{jr})\pmb{v}_j$  with  $\phi (\pmb {q}_i)^\top \sum_j\sum_r\pi_{jr}\phi (\pmb {k}_{jr})\pmb {v}_j^\top$ , as in linear transformers, reduces the memory and computational cost of computing the attention map in Transformer-MLK from  $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$  to  $\mathcal{O}(N)$ , making Transformer-MLK scalable to very long sequences.

# 3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, we numerically justify the efficiency of Transformer-MGK/MLK and empirically study the advantage of using mixture of keys on various benchmarks, including different tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) (Section 3.1) and language modeling on Wikitext-103 (Merit et al., 2017) (Section 3.2). We aim to show that: (i) Transformer-MGK/MLK with half the number of heads is comparable or better than the baseline softmax and linear transformers with full the number of heads while being more efficient in both computational cost and memory footprints; (ii) Mixture of keys helps reduce the redundancy in multi-head transformers and benefits learning of the long-term dependency in long input sequences; (iii) Using the same number of heads, Transformer-MGK/MLK significantly outperforms the baseline softmax and linear transformers. Especially in the case of Transformer-MLK, it helps reduce the performance gap between softmax and linear transformers while still maintaining linear memory and computational complexities.

Throughout this section, we compare Transformer-MGK/MLK with the softmax and linear transformers that have the same or double the number of attention heads. Among the design options for Transformer-MGK mentioned in Section 2.3, we use the one with Soft-E step but make the parameter  $\pi_{jr}$  and  $k_{jr}$  learnable and fix the variance  $\sigma_{jr}^2$  to be constants. We study both implementations for keys: (A)  $k_{jr}$  is a linear projection of the input  $\mathbf{x}$ , i.e.,  $k_{jr} = \mathbf{x}\mathbf{W}_{k_{jr}}$  and (B)  $k_{jr}$  are shifted version of each other, i.e.,  $k_{jr} = \mathbf{x}\mathbf{W}_{k_j} + b_r$ .

In this section, we refer to the Transformer-MGK/MLK whose keys are implemented by (A) as Transformer-MGK/MLK, and whose keys are implemented by (B) as Transformer-sMGK/sMLK. We empirically compare these models with other design options for Transformer-MGK in Section 3.3. All experiments are conducted on a server with 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Details on datasets, models, and training are provided in the Appendix.

# 3.1 LONG RANGE ARENA (LRA) BENCHMARK

Datasets and metrics We consider the following tasks in the LRA benchmark: Listops (Nangia & Bowman, 2018), byte-level IMDb reviews text classification (Maas et al., 2011), and byte-level document retrieval (Radev et al., 2013). These tasks involve long sequences of length  $2K$ ,  $4K$ , and  $4K$ , respectively. We follow the setup/evaluation protocol in (Tay et al., 2021) and report the test accuracy for individual task and the average result across all tasks.

Models and baselines We compare our 1-head, 2-head, 4-head Transformer-MGK and MLK with the baseline softmax (Vaswani et al., 2017) and linear transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) that have 1 head, 2 heads, 4 heads, and 8 heads. Each model consists of two layers, and we adopt the model and training setting from (Xiong et al., 2021) in our experiments.

Results We summarize our results in Table 1. Transformer-MGKs with half the number of heads consistently achieve better test accuracy than the baseline softmax attention across tasks. Since fewer heads are needed, transformer-MGKs use less parameters and need less FLOPs to compute than the baselines. We provide a detailed efficiency analysis for Transformer-MGKs in Figure 3. More interestingly, these efficiency advantages of Transformer-MGK over the baseline becomes more

Table 1: Test Accuracy  $(\%)$  of Transformer-MGK compared with the baseline softmax transformer on the LRA benchmark.

significant as the number of heads in the baseline model grows. Also, when using the same number of heads as the baseline models, Transformer-MGKs further improve over those baselines. Among the models, Transformer-sMGK performs the best across LRA tasks.

We also compare the performance of Transformer-MLK with the baseline linear transformers in Table 2. Like Transformer-MGK, Transformer-MLK yields comparable or better results than the baseline using only half the number of heads with less parameters and FLOPs. When using the same number of heads, Transformer-MLK helps improve the linear transformer further.

In Figure 1, we compare the training loss and test accuracy curves of our 1-head and 2-head Transformer-MGK/MLK with the 2-head softmax and 2-head linear transformers on the document retrieval task. This retrieval task has the longest average sequence-length and attention span among the LRA tasks (Tay et al., 2021). On this task, as shown in Figure 1, our Transformer-MGKs/MLKs are always better than the baseline models throughout the training. This observation corroborates our models's capability of capturing long-range dependencies in very long input sequences.

# 3.2 LANGUAGE MODELING ON WIKITEXT-103

Next we confirm the advantage of our models on a large-scale application. We consider the word-level language modeling task on WikiText-103 (Merit et al., 2017) for our experiments in this section..

Datasets and metrics. WikiText-103 consists of articles from Wikipedia and is a dataset with long contextual dependencies. The training set is made up of about  $28K$  articles containing  $103M$  running words; this corresponds to text blocks of about 3600 words. The validation and test sets are composed of  $218K$  and  $246K$  running words, respectively. Each of them contains 60 articles and about  $268K$  words. Our experiment follows the standard setting (Merit et al., 2017; Schlag et al., 2021) and splits the training data into  $L$ -word independent long segments. For evaluation, we use a batch size of 1, and go through the text sequence with a sliding window of size  $L$ . We consider only the last position for computing perplexity (PPL) except in the first segment, where all positions are evaluated as in (Al-Rfou et al., 2019b; Schlag et al., 2021).

Models and baselines We compare the 4 and 8-head Transformer-MGK/MLK with the 8-head softmax (Vaswani et al., 2017) and linear transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Each model consists of 16 layers. Our experiments follow the setting from (Schlag et al., 2021).

Results As shown in Table 3, our Transformer-MGKs outperform the baseline softmax transformers. Even when using only half the number of attention heads (i.e., 4 heads vs. 8 heads as in the baselines), the Transformer-MGK still achieves better test perplexities than the baseline. Adding more heads into our Transformer-MGKs improves their performance. Similarly, Transformer-MLKs attain comparable test and validation perplexities to the baseline linear transformers when using half the number of attention heads. When using the same number of attention heads as in the baseline, Transformer-MLKs consistently achieve better performance.

# 3.3 EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

In this section, we conduct empirical analysis based on the Transformer-MGK trained for the document retrieval tasks. Results for Transformer-MLKs and the language modeling task are provided in the Appendix.

Transformer-MGK helps avoid learning redundant heads We visually compare attention matrices learned by Transformer-MGKs and the baseline softmax transformer on the document retrieval task in Figure 2. In particular, we randomly select an attention matrix at each head in each layer and visualize that attention matrix for each model in comparison. Figure 2(Left) shows that the queries in Transformer-MGKs can attend to a variety of keys and equivalently to other tokens at different positions in the input sequence. This diversity in attention pattern helps reduce the chance that the model learns similar and redundant attention matrices at different heads significantly.

Another metric to measure the representation capacity of an attention matrix is its rank. Attention matrices with high ranks can capture more diverse attention patterns compared to those with low ranks (Nguyen et al., 2021). We study the rank of the attention matrix from the Transformer-MGK and the softmax transformer trained for the document retrieval task. In particular, we randomly select 1000 different attention matrices at each layer from each model. Then, we perform singular value decomposition (SVD) to compute the rank of each matrix and threshold the singular values smaller than  $10^{-6}$ . Figure 2(Right) presents the distribution of the rank of attention matrices at each layer of the Transformer-MGK and the softmax transformer. We observe that attention matrices in Transformer-MGK has higher rank than those in the softmax transformer. Thus, our attention with

Figure 2: (Left) Visualization of attention matrices in the baseline 4-head softmax transformer (left), 4-head Transformer-MGK (middle), and 2-head Transformer-MGK (right) trained on the document retrieval task. Attention matrices from our Transformer-MGKs have more diverse pattern than those from the baseline softmax transformer. This diversity implies that queries in Transformer-MGKs can attend to more positions in the input sequence, reducing the risk of learning redundant heads. (Right) Rank distribution of attention matrices in Transformer-MGK and softmax transformer. This distribution shows that attention matrices in Transformer-MGK have higher rank than those in the softmax transformer and thus can capture more diverse attention patterns.

MGK is capable of capturing more diverse and complex attention patterns than the baseline softmax attention.

Transformer-MGK reduces model complexity and computational cost We empirically analyze the efficiency of Transformer-MGK. Figure 3 compares the computational cost, measured in FLOPS, and model complexity, measured in the number of parameters, between our Transformer-MGK that has half the number of heads and the full-head softmax transformer. The more heads being used, the more advantage Transformer-MGK has over the softmax transformer. For much larger transformer models, this saving is significant.

Figure 3: Computational cost (FLOPs) and the number of parameters of Transformer-MGK vs. the baseline softmax transformer. Transformer-MGK is more efficient in both metrics than the softmax transformer, and this advantage of Transformer-MGK grows with the number of head.

# Comparing different inference and learning techniques

Table 4 compares the performance of Transformer-MGKs using different design options mentioned in Section 2.3. In particular, we consider the following three design options: A) Soft-E step, parameters  $\pi_{jr}$  and  $k_{jr}$  are learnable via SGD, and variance  $\sigma_{jr}^{2}$  are constants, B) Soft-E step, parameter  $\pi_{jr}$  is updated according to the M-step update,  $k_{jr}$  are learnable via SGD, and variance  $\sigma_{jr}^{2}$  are constants, and C) Hard-E step,  $\pi_{jr}$  and  $k_{jr}$  are learnable via SGD, and variance  $\sigma_{jr}^{2}$  are constants. Note that Transformer-MGKs with setting A are the default models we use in all experiments above. Table 4 summarizes our comparison results on tasks in the LRA benchmark. In Table 4, Transformer-MGK + Hard-E is the Transformer-MGK with setting C, Transformer-MGK + Soft-E is the Transformer-MGK with setting B, and Transformer-MGK only is the Transformer-MGK with setting A. It is worth noting that Transformer-sMGK + Hard-E obtains comparable results to the models with the best performance in each task even though it is the most efficient model in our study.

# 4 RELATED WORK

Efficient Transformers. Efficient transformers can be classified into several categories, as summarized in (Roy et al., 2021). Among these categories are models with fixed patterns, which design the attention matrix to have sparse structure (Parmar et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Qiu et al., 2019; Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020). Another category includes models that combine two or more different access patterns to improve the coverage (Child et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2019). Access patterns can also make learnable to in a data-driven fashion (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021; Tay et al., 2020). Other efficient transformers take advantage of a side memory module to access multiple tokens at once (Lee et al., 2019; Sukhbaatar et al., 2019; Asai & Choi, 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020). Finally, low-rank and kernelization approximation are utilized to enhance the memory and computational efficiency of computing self-attention, see e.g., (Tsai et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2021). Our MLK approach is complementary to those efficient transformers and can be easily incorporated into those architectures to further improve their accuracy and efficiency.

Redundancy in Transformers Latest works suggest that most of the neurons and heads in the pre-trained transformer are redundant and can be removed when optimizing towards a downstream task (Dalvi et al., 2020; Michel et al., 2019; Durrani et al., 2020). Some other works also study the contextualized embeddings in pretrained networks under this redundancy due to overparameterization and show that the representations learned within these models are highly anisotropic (Mu & Viswanath, 2018; Ethayarajh, 2019). From these observation, an emerging body of work is proposed to either distill or prune the model, including (Sanh et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019b; Sajjad et al., 2020). Our MGK/MLK approach can be combined with these distilling and pruning methods to improve their accuracy and efficiency.

Mixture Models for Transformers Recently, several works have used mixture models to study and enhance transformers. Switch transformers (Fedus et al., 2021) employ the routing algorithm in Mixture of Experts (MoE) to reduce the communication and computational costs in transformers. (Nguyen et al., 2018; Patel et al., 2016) derive a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian mixture models for deep neural networks that can be extended to study transformers and attention-based architectures. Other works that use mixture models with transformers include (Cho et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020).

# 5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we proposed Transformer-MGK, a class of transformers that use Gaussian mixture model to represent the key vectors in self-attention. Transformer-MGK reduces the redundancy among heads in transformer. Furthermore, attention heads in the Transformer-MGK have better representation capability than those in the baseline, allowing the Transformer-MGK to achieve comparable or better performance than the baseline softmax Transformer while using only half of the number of heads. As a result, comparing to the baseline, the Transformer-MGK uses less parameters and requires the smaller amount of FLOPs. Furthermore, we extend the Transformer-MGK into the Transformer-MLK to use linear attentions for better efficiency. We empirically validate the advantage of the Transformer-MGK/MLK over the baseline softmax and linear attentions on various benchmarks including tasks in the LRA benchmark and WikiText-103 language modeling. In our work, we make the means and the variance of the cluster learnable variables and constants, respectively. It is interesting to explore how to leverage the M-step update in the EM algorithm to update those parameters. Furthermore, we leave the application of Transformer-MGK/MLK for improving the vision transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2020) as future work.
