# ABSTRACT

Recent advances at the intersection of dense large graph limits and mean field games have begun to enable the scalable analysis of a broad class of dynamical sequential games with large numbers of agents. So far, results have been largely limited to graphon mean field systems with continuous-time diffusive or jump dynamics, typically without control and with little focus on computational methods. We propose a novel discrete-time formulation for graphon mean field games as the limit of non-linear dense graph Markov games with weak interaction. On the theoretical side, we give extensive and rigorous existence and approximation properties of the graphon mean field solution in sufficiently large systems. On the practical side we provide general learning schemes for graphon mean field equilibria by either introducing agent equivalence classes or reformulating the graphon mean field system as a classical mean field system. By repeatedly finding a regularized optimal control solution and its generated mean field, we successfully obtain plausible approximate Nash equilibria in otherwise infeasible large dense graph games with many agents. Empirically, we are able to demonstrate on a number of examples that the finite-agent behavior comes increasingly close to the mean field behavior for our computed equilibria as the graph or system size grows, verifying our theory. More generally, we successfully apply policy gradient reinforcement learning in conjunction with sequential Monte Carlo methods.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Today, reinforcement learning (RL) finds application in various application areas such as robotics (Kober et al., 2013), autonomous driving (Kiran et al., 2021) or navigation of stratospheric balloons (Bellemare et al., 2020) as a method to realize effective sequential decision-making in complex problems. RL remains a very active research area, and there remain many challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as a generalization of RL such as learning goals, non-stationarity and scalability of algorithms (Zhang et al., 2021). Nonetheless, potential applications for MARL are manifold and include e.g. teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (Tožicka et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2018) or video games (Berner et al., 2019; Vinyals et al., 2017). While the domain of MARL is somewhat empirically successful, problems quickly become intractable as the number of agents grows, and methods in MARL typically miss a theoretical foundation. A recent tractable approach to handling the scalability problem in MARL are competitive mean field games and cooperative mean field control (Gu et al., 2021). Instead of considering generic multi agent Markov games, one considers many agents under the weak interaction principle, i.e. each agent alone has a negligible influence on all other agents. This class of models naturally contains a large number of real world scenarios and can find application e.g. in analysis of power network resilience (Bagagiolo & Bauso, 2014), smart heating (Kizilkale & Malhame, 2014), edge computing (Banez et al., 2019) or flocking (Perrin et al., 2021). See also Djehiche et al. (2017) for a review of other engineering applications.

Mean field games. Mean field games (MFGs) were first popularized in the independent seminal works of Huang et al. (2006) and Lasry & Lions (2007) for the setting of differential games with diffusion-type dynamics given by stochastic differential equations. See also Guéant et al. (2011); Bensoussan et al. (2013) for a review. Since then, extensions have been manifold and include e.g. discrete-time (Saldi et al., 2018), partial observability (Saldi et al., 2019), major-minor formulations (Nourian & Caines, 2013) and many more. In the learning community, there has been recent interest

in finding learning-based solutions for mean field equilibria (Cardaliaguet & Hadikhanloo, 2017; Mguni et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2019; Subramanian & Mahajan, 2019; Pasztor et al., 2021) or applying related approximations directly to MARL (Yang et al., 2018). Recently, there has also been an increased focus on the cooperative case of mean field control (Carmona et al., 2019b), for which dynamic programming holds on an enlarged state space, resulting in a high-dimensional Markov decision process (Pham & Wei, 2018; Motte & Pham, 2019; Gu et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2021).

Graph mean field systems. For mean field systems on dense graphs, prior work mostly considers mean field systems without control (Vizuete et al., 2020) or time-dynamics, i.e. the static case (Parise & Ozdaglar, 2019; Carmona et al., 2019a). There have been efforts to control cooperative graphon mean field systems with continuous-time diffusive linear dynamics using spectral methods (Gao & Caines, 2019a,b). Caines & Huang (2019) consider continuous-time diffusion-type model with many clusters of agents as well as an approximate Nash property as the number of clusters and agents grows. Bayraktar et al. (2020); Bet et al. (2020) consider large non-clustered systems in a continuous-time diffusion-type setting without control, and Aurell et al. (2021b) consider the continuous-time linear quadratic case. To the best of our knowledge, no prior works study discrete-time graphon mean field games or computational methods, except for Aurell et al. (2021a) with computational methods for continuous-time jump processes with control over rate matrices. Finally, for the not-so-dense, sparse graph case there exist various preliminary results (Gkogkas & Kuehn, 2020; Lacker & Soret, 2020), though the setting largely remains to be developed.

Our contribution. In this work, we propose a dense graph limit extension of MFGs in discrete-time, combining graphon mean field systems with mean field games. More specifically, we consider limits of many-agent systems with discrete-time graph-based dynamics and weak neighbor interactions. In contrast to prior works, we consider both the first general discrete-time formulation as well as its controlled case, which is a natural setting for many problems that are inherently discrete in time or to be solved at discrete decision times. Our contribution can be summarized as: (i) formulating to the best of our knowledge the first general discrete-time graphon MFG framework for approximating otherwise intractable large dense graph games; (ii) providing an extensive theoretical analysis of existence and approximation properties in such systems; (iii) providing general learning schemes for finding graphon mean field equilibria, and (iv) empirically evaluating our proposed approach with verification of theoretical results in the finite  $N$ -agent graph system, finding plausible approximate Nash equilibria for otherwise infeasible large dense graph games with many agents.

# 2 DENSE GRAPH MEAN FIELD GAMES

We begin by giving a short overview on graph-theoretical preliminaries. For a review, see Lovász (2012). The study of dense large graph limits deals with the limiting representation of adjacency matrices called graphons. Define  $\mathcal{I} \coloneqq [0,1]$  and  $\mathcal{W}_0$  as the space of all bounded, symmetric and measurable functions (graphons)  $W \in \mathcal{W}_0$ ,  $W \colon \mathcal{I} \times \mathcal{I} \to \mathbb{R}$  bounded by  $0 \leq W \leq 1$ . For any simple graph  $G = (\{1,\dots,N\},\mathcal{E})$ , we define its step-graphon a.e. uniquely by

$$
W _ {G} (x, y) = \sum_ {i, j \in \{1, \dots , N \}} \mathbf {1} _ {(i, j) \in \varepsilon} \cdot \mathbf {1} _ {x \in \left(\frac {i - 1}{N}, \frac {i}{N} \right]} \cdot \mathbf {1} _ {y \in \left(\frac {j - 1}{N}, \frac {j}{N} \right]}, \tag {1}
$$

see e.g. Figure 1. We equip  $\mathcal{W}_0$  with the cut (semi-)norm  $\| \cdot \|_{\square}$  and cut (pseudo-)metric  $\delta_{\square}$

$$
\| W \| _ {\square} := \sup  _ {S, T} \left| \int_ {S \times T} W (x, y) \mathrm {d} x \mathrm {d} y \right|, \quad \delta_ {\square} \left(W, W ^ {\prime}\right) := \inf  _ {\varphi} \| W - W _ {\varphi} ^ {\prime} \| _ {\square}, \tag {2}
$$

for graphons  $W, W' \in \mathcal{W}_0$  and  $W_{\varphi}'(x,y) \coloneqq W'(\varphi(x), \varphi(y))$ , where the supremum is over all measurable subsets  $S, T \subseteq \mathcal{I}$  and the infimum is over measure-preserving bijections  $\varphi \colon \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{I}$ .

To provide motivation, note that convergence in  $\delta_{\square}$  is equivalent to e.g. convergence of probabilities of locally encountering any fixed subgraph by randomly sampling a subset of nodes. Many such properties of graph sequences  $(G_N)_{N\in \mathbb{N}}$  converging to some graphon  $W\in \mathcal{W}_0$  can then be described by  $W$ , and we point to Lovász (2012) for details. In this work, we will primarily use the analytical fact that for converging graphon sequences  $\| W_{G_N} - W\| _\square \to 0$ , we equivalently have

$$
\left\| W _ {G _ {N}} - W \right\| _ {L _ {\infty} \rightarrow L _ {1}} = \sup  _ {\| g \| _ {\infty} \leq 1} \int_ {\mathcal {I}} \left| \int_ {\mathcal {I}} \left(W _ {G _ {N}} (\alpha , \beta) - W (\alpha , \beta)\right) g (\beta) \mathrm {d} \beta \right| \mathrm {d} \alpha \rightarrow 0 \tag {3}
$$

under the operator norm of operators  $L_{\infty}\rightarrow L_1$  , see e.g. Lovasz (2012), Lemma 8.11.

By Lovász (2012), Theorem 11.59, the above is equivalent to convergence in the cut metric  $\delta_{\square}(W_N,W)\to 0$  up to relabeling. In the following, we will therefore assume sequences of simple graphs  $G_{N} = (\mathcal{V}_{N},\mathcal{E}_{N})$  with vertices  $\mathcal{V}_N = \{1,\ldots ,N\}$ , edge sets  $\mathcal{E}_N$ , edge indicator variables  $\xi_{i,j}^{N}\coloneqq \mathbf{1}_{(i,j)\in \mathcal{E}_N}$  for all nodes  $i,j\in \mathcal{V}_N$ , and associated step graphons  $W_{N}$  converging in cut norm.

Assumption 1. The sequence of step-graphons  $(W_N)_{N\in \mathbb{N}}$  converges in cut norm  $\| \cdot \| _0$  or equivalently in operator norm  $\| \cdot \|_{L_{\infty}\to L_1}$  as  $N\rightarrow \infty$  to some graphon  $W\in \mathcal{W}_0$ , i.e.

$$
\left\| W _ {N} - W \right\| _ {\square} \rightarrow 0, \quad \left\| W _ {N} - W \right\| _ {L _ {\infty} \rightarrow L _ {1}} \rightarrow 0. \tag {4}
$$

Next, we define  $W$ -random graphs to consist of vertices  $\mathcal{V}_N \coloneqq \{1, \dots, N\}$  with adjacency matrices  $\pmb{\xi}^N$  generated by sampling graphon indices  $\alpha_i$  uniformly from  $\mathcal{I}$  and edges  $\xi_{i,j}^N \sim$  Bernoulli  $(W(\alpha_i, \alpha_j))$  for all vertices  $i, j \in \mathcal{V}_N$ . For experiments, by Lovász (2012), Lemma 10.16, we can thereby generate a.s. converging graph sequences by sampling  $W$ -random graphs for any fixed graphon  $W \in \mathcal{W}_0$ . In principle, one could also consider arbitrary graph generating processes whenever a valid relabeling function  $\varphi$  is known.

In our work, the usage of graphons enables us to find mean field systems on dense graphs and to extend the expressiveness of classical MFGs. As examples, we will use the limiting graphons of uniform attachment, ranked attachment and  $p$ -Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graphs given by  $W_{\mathrm{unif}}(x,y) = 1 - \max(x,y)$ ,  $W_{\mathrm{att}}(x,y) = 1 - xy$  and  $W_{\mathrm{er}}(x,y) = p$  respectively (Borgs et al., 2011; Lovász, 2012), each of which exhibits different node connectivities as shown in Figure 2.

# 2.1 FINITE AGENT GRAPH GAME

In the following, we give a dense graph  $N$ -agent model as well as its corresponding mean field system. For simplicity of analysis, we consider finite state and action spaces  $\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{U}$  as well as times  $\mathcal{T} \coloneqq \{0,1,\dots,T - 1\}$ . On a metric space  $\mathcal{A}$ , define the spaces of all Borel probability measures  $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A})$  and all Borel measures  $\mathcal{B}_1(\mathcal{A})$  bounded by 1, equipped with the  $L_1$  norm. For simplified notation, we denote both a measure  $\nu$  and its probability mass function by  $\nu(\cdot)$ . Define the space of

policies  $\Pi \coloneqq \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{U})^{\mathcal{T}\times \mathcal{X}}$ , i.e. agents apply Markovian feedback policies  $\pi^i = (\pi_t^i)_{t\in \mathcal{T}}\in \Pi$  that act on local state information. This allows for the definition of agent state and action random variables

$$
X _ {0} ^ {i} \sim \mu_ {0}, \quad U _ {t} ^ {i} \sim \pi_ {t} ^ {i} (\cdot | X _ {t} ^ {i}), \quad X _ {t + 1} ^ {i} \sim P (\cdot | X _ {t} ^ {i}, U _ {t} ^ {i}, \mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {i}), \quad \forall t \in \mathcal {T}, \forall i \in \mathcal {V} _ {N} \tag {5}
$$

under some transition kernel  $P\colon \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{U}\times \mathcal{B}_1(\mathcal{X})\to \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})$  , where the empirical neighborhood mean field  $\mathbb{G}_t^i$  of agent  $i$  is defined as the (unnormized) neighborhood state distribution

$$
\mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {i} := \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {j \in \mathcal {V} _ {N}} \xi_ {i, j} ^ {N} \delta_ {X _ {t} ^ {j}} \in \mathcal {B} _ {1} (\mathcal {X}), \tag {6}
$$

where  $\delta$  is the Dirac measure. Finally, for each agent  $i$  we define separate, competitive objectives

$$
J _ {i} ^ {N} \left(\pi^ {1}, \dots , \pi^ {N}\right) := \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {T - 1} r \left(X _ {t} ^ {i}, U _ {t} ^ {i}, \mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {i}\right) \right] \tag {7}
$$

to be maximized over  $\pi^i$ , where  $r: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{U} \times \mathcal{B}_1(\mathcal{X}) \to \mathbb{R}$  is an arbitrary reward function.

Remark 1. Note that we can also consider the infinite-horizon objective  $\tilde{J}_i^N (\pi^1,\dots ,\pi^N)\equiv$ $\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t = 0}^{\infty}\gamma^{t}r(X_{t}^{i},U_{t}^{i},\mathbb{G}_{t}^{i})\right]$  with similar results. One may also extend to neighborhood state-action distributions and time-dependent  $r$ ,  $P$ , though we avoid this for expositional simplicity.

With this, we can give a typical notion of multi-agent solution as found e.g. in Saldi et al. (2018). For technical reasons, we will slightly weaken optimality to a fraction  $1 - p$  of agents.

Definition 1. An  $(\varepsilon, p)$ -Markov-Nash equilibrium (almost Markov-Nash equilibrium) for  $\varepsilon, p > 0$  is defined as a tuple of policies  $(\pi^1, \ldots, \pi^N) \in \Pi^N$  such that for any  $i \in \mathcal{W}_N$ , we have

$$
J _ {i} ^ {N} \left(\pi^ {1}, \dots , \pi^ {N}\right) \geq \sup  _ {\pi \in \Pi} J _ {i} ^ {N} \left(\pi^ {1}, \dots , \pi^ {i - 1}, \pi , \pi^ {i + 1}, \dots , \pi^ {N}\right) - \varepsilon , \tag {8}
$$

for some set  $\mathcal{W}_N\subseteq \mathcal{V}_N$  containing at least  $\lfloor (1 - p)N\rfloor$  agents, i.e.  $|\mathcal{W}_N|\geq \lfloor (1 - p)N\rfloor$

The minimal such  $\varepsilon > 0$  for any fixed policy tuple (and  $p = 0$ ) is also called its exploitability. Whilst we ordain  $\varepsilon$ -optimality only for a fraction  $1 - p$  of agents, if the fraction  $p$  is negligible, it will have negligible impact on other agents as a result of the weak interaction property. Thus, the solution will be nonetheless approximately optimal for almost all agents for sufficiently small  $p$ , regardless of the behavior of that fraction  $p$  of agents. In the following, we will give a limiting formulation that shall provide  $(\varepsilon, p)$ -Markov-Nash equilibria with  $\varepsilon, p \to 0$  as  $N \to \infty$ .

# 2.2 GRAPHON MEAN FIELD GAME

The formal  $N\to \infty$  limit of the  $N$ -agent game constitutes its graphon mean field game (GMFG), which shall be rigorously justified in Section 3. We define the space of measurable state marginal ensembles  $\mathcal{M}_t\coloneqq \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})^{\mathcal{I}}$  and measurable mean field ensembles  $\mathcal{M}\coloneqq \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})^{\mathcal{T}\times \mathcal{I}}$ , i.e. measurable maps  $\alpha \mapsto \mu_t^\alpha (x)$  for any  $\pmb {\mu}\in \mathcal{M}$ ,  $t\in \mathcal{T}$ ,  $x\in \mathcal{X}$ . Similarly, we define the space of measurable policy ensembles  $\Pi \subseteq \Pi^{\mathcal{I}}$ , i.e. measurable  $\alpha \mapsto \pi_t^\alpha (u\mid x)$  for any  $\pmb {\pi}\in \Pi$ ,  $t\in \mathcal{T}$ ,  $x\in \mathcal{X}$ ,  $u\in \mathcal{U}$ .

In the GMFG, we will consider infinitely many agents  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$  instead of the finitely many  $i \in \mathcal{V}_N$ . As a result, we will have infinitely many policies  $\pi^{\alpha} \in \Pi$  - one for each agent  $\alpha$  - through some measurable policy ensemble  $\pi \in \Pi$ . We again define state and action random variables

$$
X _ {0} ^ {\alpha} \sim \mu_ {0}, \quad U _ {t} ^ {\alpha} \sim \pi_ {t} ^ {\alpha} (\cdot \mid X _ {t} ^ {\alpha}), \quad X _ {t + 1} ^ {\alpha} \sim P (\cdot \mid X _ {t} ^ {\alpha}, U _ {t} ^ {\alpha}, \mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {\alpha}), \quad \forall (\alpha , t) \in \mathcal {I} \times \mathcal {T} \tag {9}
$$

where we introduce the (now deterministic) neighborhood mean field of each agent  $\alpha$  as

$$
\mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {\alpha} := \int_ {\mathcal {I}} W (\alpha , \beta) \mu_ {t} ^ {\beta} \mathrm {d} \beta \in \mathcal {B} _ {1} (\mathcal {X}) \tag {10}
$$

for some deterministic  $\pmb{\mu} \in \mathcal{M}$ . Under fixed  $\pi \in \Pi$ ,  $\mu_t^\alpha$  should be understood as the law of  $X_t^\alpha$ ,  $\mu_t^\alpha \equiv \mathcal{L}(X_t^\alpha)$ . Finally, define the maximization objective of agent  $\alpha$  over  $\pi^\alpha$  for fixed  $\pmb{\mu} \in \mathcal{M}$  as

$$
J _ {\alpha} ^ {\mu} \left(\pi^ {\alpha}\right) \equiv \mathbb {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {T - 1} r \left(X _ {t} ^ {\alpha}, U _ {t} ^ {\alpha}, \mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {\alpha}\right) \right]. \tag {11}
$$

To formulate the limiting version of Nash equilibria, we define a map  $\Psi \colon \Pi \to \mathcal{M}$  mapping from a policy ensemble  $\pi \in \Pi$  to the corresponding generated mean field ensemble  $\mu = \Psi(\pi) \in \mathcal{M}$  by

$$
\mu_ {0} ^ {\alpha} \equiv \mu_ {0}, \quad \mu_ {t + 1} ^ {\alpha} \left(x ^ {\prime}\right) \equiv \sum_ {x \in \mathcal {X}} \mu_ {t} ^ {\alpha} (x) \sum_ {u \in \mathcal {U}} \pi_ {t} ^ {\alpha} (u \mid x) P \left(x ^ {\prime} \mid x, u, \mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {\alpha}\right), \quad \forall \alpha \in \mathcal {I} \tag {12}
$$

where integrability in (10) holds by induction, and note how then  $\mu_t^\alpha = \mathcal{L}(X_t^\alpha)$ .

Similarly, let  $\Phi \colon \mathcal{M} \to 2^{\Pi}$  map from a mean field ensemble  $\pmb{\mu}$  to the set of optimal policy ensembles  $\pi$  characterized by  $\pi^{\alpha} \in \arg \max_{\pi \in \Pi} J_{\alpha}^{\mu}(\pi^{\alpha})$  for all  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$ , which is particularly fulfilled if  $\pi_t^\alpha(u|x) > 0 \Rightarrow u \in \arg \max_{u' \in \mathcal{U}} Q_\alpha^\mu(t,x,u')$  for all  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$ ,  $t \in \mathcal{T}$ ,  $x \in \mathcal{X}$ ,  $u \in \mathcal{U}$ , where  $Q_\alpha^\mu$  is the optimal action value function under fixed  $\pmb{\mu} \in \mathcal{M}$  following the Bellman equation

$$
Q _ {\alpha} ^ {\mu} (t, x, u) = r \left(x, u, \mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {\alpha}\right) + \sum_ {x ^ {\prime} \in \mathcal {X}} P \left(x ^ {\prime} \mid x, u, \mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {\alpha}\right) \underset {u ^ {\prime} \in \mathcal {U}} {\arg \max } Q _ {\alpha} ^ {\mu} \left(t + 1, x ^ {\prime}, u ^ {\prime}\right) \tag {13}
$$

with  $Q_{\alpha}^{\mu}(T,x,u)\equiv 0$  and general time-dependence, see Puterman (2014) for a review.

We can now define the GMFG version of Nash equilibria as policy ensembles  $\pi$  generating mean field ensembles  $\mu$  under which they are optimal, as  $\mu_t^\alpha = \mathcal{L}(X_t^\alpha)$  if all agents  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$  follow  $\pi^\alpha$ .

Definition 2. A Graphon Mean Field Equilibrium (GMFE) is a pair  $(\pi, \mu) \in \Pi \times \mathcal{M}$  such that  $\pi \in \Phi(\mu)$  and  $\mu = \Psi(\pi)$ .

# 3 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

To obtain meaningful optimality results beyond empirical mean field convergence, we will need a Lipschitz assumption as in the uncontrolled, continuous-time case (cf. Bayraktar et al. (2020), Condition 2.3) and typical in mean field theory (Huang et al., 2006).

Assumption 2. Let  $r, P, W$  be Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constants  $L_{r}, L_{P}, L_{W} > 0$ .

Note that all proofs but Theorem 1 also hold for only block-wise Lipschitz continuous  $W$ , see Appendix A.1. Since  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{U} \times B_1(\mathcal{X})$  is compact,  $r$  is bounded by the extreme value theorem.

Proposition 1. Under Assumption 2,  $r$  will be bounded by  $|r| \leq M_r$  for some constant  $M_r > 0$ .

We then obtain existence of a GMFE by reformulating the GMFG as a classical MFG and applying existing results from Saldi et al. (2018). More precisely, we consider the equivalent MFG with extended state space  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{I}$ , action space  $\mathcal{U}$ , policy  $\tilde{\pi} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{U})^{\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{I}}$ , mean field  $\tilde{\mu} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{I})^{\mathcal{T}}$ , reward function  $\tilde{r}((x, \alpha), u, \tilde{\mu}) := r(x, u, \int_{\mathcal{I}} W(\alpha_t, \beta) \tilde{\mu}_t(\cdot, \beta) \mathrm{d}\beta)$  and transition dynamics such that the states  $(\tilde{X}_t, \alpha_t)$  follow  $(\tilde{X}_0, \alpha_0) \sim \tilde{\mu}_0 := \mu_0 \otimes \mathrm{Unif}([0, 1])$  and

$$
\tilde {U} _ {t} \sim \tilde {\pi} _ {t} (\cdot | \tilde {X} _ {t}, \alpha_ {t}), \quad \tilde {X} _ {t + 1} \sim P (\cdot | \tilde {X} _ {t}, \tilde {U} _ {t}, \int_ {\mathcal {I}} W (\alpha_ {t}, \beta) \tilde {\mu} _ {t} (\cdot , \beta) \mathrm {d} \beta), \quad \alpha_ {t + 1} = \alpha_ {t}. \tag {14}
$$

Theorem 1. Under Assumption 2, there exists a  $GMFE(\pi ,\mu)\in \Pi \times \mathcal{M}$

Meanwhile, in finite games, even showing the existence of Nash equilibria in local feedback policies is problematic (Saldi et al., 2018). Note however, that while this reformulation will be useful for learning and existence, it does not allow us to conclude that the finite graph game is well approximated, as classical MFG approximation theorems e.g. in Saldi et al. (2018) do not consider the graph structure and directly use the limiting graphon  $W$  in the dynamics (14).

As our next main result, we shall therefore show rigorously that the GMFE can provide increasingly good approximations of the  $N$ -agent finite graph game as  $N \to \infty$ . As mentioned, the following also holds for only block-wise Lipschitz continuous  $W$  instead of fully Lipschitz continuous  $W$ . Complete mathematical proofs together with additional theoretical supplements can be found in Appendix A.1 and A.2. To obtain joint  $N$ -agent policies as approximate Nash equilibria from a GMFE  $(\pi, \mu)$ , we define the map  $\Gamma_N(\pi) \coloneqq (\pi^1, \pi^2, \ldots, \pi^N) \in \Pi^N$ , where

$$
\pi_ {t} ^ {i} (u \mid x) := \pi_ {t} ^ {\alpha_ {i}} (u \mid x), \quad \forall (\alpha , t, x, u) \in \mathcal {I} \times \mathcal {T} \times \mathcal {X} \times \mathcal {U} \tag {15}
$$

with  $\alpha_{i} = \frac{i}{N}$ , as by Assumption 1 the agents are correctly labeled such that they match up with their limiting graphon indices  $\alpha_{i} \in \mathcal{I}$ . In our experiments, we use the  $\alpha_{i}$  generated during the generation

process of the  $W$ -random graphs, though for arbitrary finite systems one would have to first identify the graphon as well as an appropriate assignment of agents to graphon indices  $\alpha_{i} \in \mathcal{I}$ , which is a separate, non-trivial problem requiring at least graphon estimation, see e.g. Xu (2018).

For theoretical analysis, we propose to lift the empirical distributions and policy tuples to the continuous domain  $\mathcal{I}$ , i.e. under an  $N$ -agent policy tuple  $(\pi^1,\dots ,\pi^N)\in \Pi^N$ , we define the step policy ensemble  $\pi^N\in \Pi$  and the random empirical step measure ensemble  $\pmb{\mu}^{N}\in \mathcal{M}$  by

$$
\pi_ {t} ^ {N, \alpha} := \sum_ {i \in \mathcal {V} _ {N}} \mathbf {1} _ {\alpha \in \left(\frac {i - 1}{N}, \frac {i}{N} \right]} \cdot \pi_ {t} ^ {i}, \quad \mu_ {t} ^ {N, \alpha} := \sum_ {i \in \mathcal {V} _ {N}} \mathbf {1} _ {\alpha \in \left(\frac {i - 1}{N}, \frac {i}{N} \right]} \cdot \delta_ {X _ {t} ^ {j}}, \quad \forall (\alpha , t) \in \mathcal {I} \times \mathcal {T}. \tag {16}
$$

In the following, we consider deviations of the  $i$ -th agent from  $(\pi^1,\pi^2,\ldots ,\pi^N) = \Gamma_N(\pi)\in \Pi^N$  to  $(\pi^{1},\dots ,\pi^{i - 1},\hat{\pi},\pi^{i + 1},\dots ,\pi^{N})\in \Pi^{N}$ , i.e. the  $i$ -th agent deviates by instead applying  $\hat{\pi}\in \Pi$ . Note that this includes the special case of no agent deviations. For any  $f\colon \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{I}\to \mathbb{R}$  and state marginal ensemble  $\pmb {\mu}_t\in \mathcal{M}_t$ , define  $\pmb {\mu}_t(f)\coloneqq \int_{\mathcal{I}}\sum_{x\in \mathcal{X}}f(x,\alpha)\mu_t^\alpha (x)\mathrm{d}\alpha$ . We are now ready to state our first result of convergence of empirical state distributions to the mean field, potentially at the classical rate  $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{N})$  and consistent with results in uncontrolled, continuous-time diffusive graphon mean field systems (cf. Bayraktar et al. (2020), Theorem 3.2).

Theorem 2. Consider a GMFE  $(\pi, \mu)$  with Lipschitz continuous  $\pi$  up to a finite number of discontinuities  $D_{\pi}$ . Under Assumption 1 and the  $N$ -agent policy  $(\pi^1, \dots, \pi^{i-1}, \hat{\pi}, \pi^{i+1}, \dots, \pi^N) \in \Pi^N$  with  $(\pi^1, \pi^2, \dots, \pi^N) = \Gamma_N(\pi) \in \Pi^N$ ,  $\hat{\pi} \in \Pi$ ,  $t \in \mathcal{T}$ , we have for all measurable functions  $f: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{I} \to \mathbb{R}$  that are uniformly bounded by some  $M_f > 0$ , that

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[\left| \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t} ^ {N} (f) - \boldsymbol {\mu} _ {t} (f) \right|\right]\rightarrow 0 \tag {17}
$$

uniformly over all possible deviations  $\hat{\pi} \in \Pi$ ,  $i \in \mathcal{V}_N$ . Furthermore, if the graphon convergence in Assumption 1 is at rate  $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ , then this rate of convergence is also  $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ .

The technical Lipschitz requirement of  $\pi$  includes e.g. the case where only finitely many optimality regimes exist over all graphon indices  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$ , which is easy to verify. We would like to remark that the above result generalizes convergence of state histograms to the mean field solution, since the state marginals of agents are additionally close to each of their graphon mean field equivalents.

The above will be necessary to show convergence of the dynamics of a deviating agent to

$$
\hat {X} _ {0} ^ {\frac {i}{N}} \sim \mu_ {0}, \quad \hat {U} _ {t} ^ {\frac {i}{N}} \sim \hat {\pi} _ {t} (\cdot | \hat {X} _ {t} ^ {\frac {i}{N}}), \quad \hat {X} _ {t + 1} ^ {\frac {i}{N}} \sim P (\cdot | \hat {X} _ {t} ^ {\frac {i}{N}}, \hat {U} _ {t} ^ {\frac {i}{N}}, \mathbb {G} _ {t} ^ {\frac {i}{N}}), \quad \forall t \in \mathcal {T} \tag {18}
$$

for almost all agents  $i$ , i.e. the dynamics are approximated by using the limiting deterministic neighborhood mean field  $\mathbb{G}^{\frac{i}{N}}$ , see Appendix A.1. This will imply the approximate Nash property:

Theorem 3. Consider a GMFE  $(\pi, \mu)$  with Lipschitz continuous  $\pi$  up to a finite number of discontinuities  $D_{\pi}$ . Under Assumptions 1 and 2, for any  $\varepsilon, p > 0$  there exists  $N'$  such that for all  $N > N'$ , it holds that the policy  $(\pi^1, \ldots, \pi^N) = \Gamma_N(\pi) \in \Pi^N$  is an  $(\varepsilon, p)$ -Markov Nash equilibrium, i.e.

$$
J _ {i} ^ {N} \left(\pi^ {1}, \dots , \pi^ {N}\right) \geq \max  _ {\pi \in \Pi} J _ {i} ^ {N} \left(\pi^ {1}, \dots , \pi^ {i - 1}, \pi , \pi^ {i + 1}, \dots , \pi^ {N}\right) - \varepsilon \tag {19}
$$

for all  $i\in \mathcal{W}_N$  and some  $\mathcal{W}_N\subseteq \mathcal{V}_N\colon |\mathcal{W}_N|\geq \lfloor (1 - p)N\rfloor$

In general, Nash equilibria are highly intractable (Daskalakis et al., 2009). Therefore, solving the GMFG allows obtaining approximate Nash equilibria in the  $N$ -agent system for sufficiently large  $N$ , since  $\varepsilon, p \to 0$  as  $N \to \infty$ . As a side result, we also obtain first results for the uncontrolled discrete-time case by considering trivial action spaces with  $|\mathcal{U}| = 1$ , see Corollary A.2 in the Appendix.

# 4 LEARNING GRAPHON MEAN FIELD EQUILIBRIA

By learning GMFE, one may potentially solve otherwise intractable large  $N$ -agent games. For learning, we can apply any existing techniques for classical MFGs (e.g. Mguni et al. (2018); Subramanian & Mahajan (2019); Guo et al. (2019)), since by (14) we have reformulated the GMFG as a classical MFG with extended state space. Nonetheless, it may make sense to treat the graphon index  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$  separately, e.g. when treating special cases such as block graphons, or by grouping graphically similar agents. We repeatedly apply two functions  $\hat{\Phi}, \Psi$  by beginning with the mean field  $\pmb{\mu}^0 \in \mathcal{M}$  generated by the uniformly random policy, and computing  $\pi^{n+1} = \hat{\Phi}(\pmb{\mu}^n)$ ,  $\pmb{\mu}^{n+1} = \Psi(\pmb{\pi}^{n+1})$  for  $n = 0, 1, \ldots$  until convergence using one of the following two approaches:

1. We introduce agent equivalence classes for the otherwise uncountably many agents  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$  by partitioning  $\mathcal{I}$  into  $M$  subsets. For example, in the simple special case of block graphons, i.e. block-wise constant  $W$ , one can solve separately for each such block equivalence class (type) of agents, similar to e.g. multi-class mean field games (Huang et al., 2006). In practice, our graphons are not simple block graphons, so we instead choose some points  $\alpha_{i} \in \mathcal{I}$  for  $i = 1, \ldots, M$  and assign each agent  $\alpha$  to the nearest  $\alpha_{i}$ , which can be thought of as using  $M$  approximate equivalence classes. Note that this does not mean that we consider a specific  $N$ -agent problem with  $N = M$ , but instead we approximate the limiting problem using the limiting graphon  $W$ , and the resulting solution will be approximately optimal for all finite systems with sufficiently large  $N$  at once. We solve the optimal control problem for each equivalence class using backwards induction (alternatively, one may use reinforcement learning), and solve the evolution equation (12) for the representatives - here  $\alpha_{i}$  - of the equivalence classes. See also Appendix A.3 for details.

2. We directly apply reinforcement learning algorithms such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) for  $\hat{\Phi}$ . The central idea here is to consider the GMFG as a classical MFG with an extended state space  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{I}$  as mentioned earlier, i.e. for fixed mean fields, we solve the MDP defined by (14). Agents shall condition their policy not only on their own state, but also their node index  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$  and the current time  $t \in \mathcal{T}$ , since the mean fields are non-stationary in general and require time-dependent policies for optimality. Here, we assume that we can sample from a simulator of (9) for a given fixed mean field as it is commonly assumed in MFG learning literature (Guo et al., 2019; Subramanian & Mahajan, 2019). For application to finite systems, one could apply a model-based RL approach coupled with graphon estimation, though this remains outside the scope of this work and remains mostly unexplored even for classical MFGs. For solving the mean field evolution equation (12), we can again use any numerical solution method applicable. Here, we choose to use the conventional sequential Monte Carlo method.

For convergence, we can give the classical feedback regularity condition (Huang et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2019) after equipping  $\Pi$ ,  $\mathcal{M}$  e.g. with the supremum metric.

Proposition 2. Assume that the maps  $\Psi, \hat{\Phi}$  are Lipschitz with constants  $c_{1}, c_{2}$  and  $c_{1} \cdot c_{2} < 1$ . Then the fixed point iteration  $\pmb{\mu}^{n+1} = \Psi(\Phi(\pmb{\mu}^{n}))$  converges to a GMFE.

However, feedback regularity is not assured, and thus there is no general convergence guarantee. Whilst one could apply fictitious play (Mguni et al., 2018), additional assumptions are needed for convergence. Instead, if necessary we regularize by introducing Boltzmann policies, provably converging to an approximation for sufficiently high temperatures (Cui & Koeppl, 2021).

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we will give an empirical verification of our theoretical results. As we are unaware of any prior discrete-time GMFGs, we propose two problems adapted from existing non-graph-based works on the three graphons in Figure 2. For space reasons, we defer detailed descriptions of problems and algorithms as well as additional analysis - including exploitability - to Appendix A.3.

The SIS-Graphon problem was considered in Cui & Koeppl (2021) as a classical discrete-time MFG. We impose an epidemics scenario where people (agents) are infected with probability proportional to the number of infected neighbors and recover with fixed probability. People may choose to take precautions (e.g. social distancing), avoiding potential costly infection periods at a fixed cost.

In the Investment-Graphon problem – an adaptation of a problem studied by Chen et al. (2021), where it was in turn adapted from Weintraub et al. (2010) – we consider many firms maximizing profits, where profits are proportional to product quality and lowered by the total neighborhood product quality, i.e. the graph models overlap in e.g. product audience or functionality. Firms can invest to improve quality, though it becomes more unlikely to improve quality as their quality rises.

# 5.1 LEARNED EQUILIBRIUM BEHAVIOR

For the SIS-Graphon problem, we apply softmax policies for each approximate equivalence class to achieve convergence, see Appendix A.3 for details on temperature choice. In Figure 3, the learned

Figure 3: Achieved equilibrium via approximate equivalence classes in SIS-Graphon, plotted for each agent  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$ . Top: Probability of taking precautions when healthy. Bottom: Probability of being infected. It can be observed that agents with less connections (higher  $\alpha$ ) will take less precautions. (a): Uniform attachment graphon; (b): Ranked attachment graphon; (c): ER graphon.

behavior can be observed for various  $\alpha$ . As expected, in the ER graphon case, behavior is identical over all  $\alpha$ . Otherwise, we find that agents take more precautions with many connections (low  $\alpha$ ) than with few connections (high  $\alpha$ ). For the uniform attachment graphon, we observe no precautions in case of negligible connectivity ( $\alpha \rightarrow 1$ ), while for the ranked attachment graphon there is no such  $\alpha \in \mathcal{I}$  (cf. Figure 2). Further, the fraction of infected agents at stationarity rises as  $\alpha$  falls. A similar analysis holds for Investment-Graphon without need for regularization, see Appendix A.3.

Note that the specific method of solution is not of central importance here, as in general any reinforcement learning with filtering method can be substituted to handle 1. otherwise intractable or 2. inherently sample-based settings. Indeed, we achieve similar results using PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) in Investment-Graphon, enabling a general RL-based methodology for GMFGs. In Figure 4, we plot investment behavior at quality  $x = 0$  as well as expected quality for each  $\alpha$  of the approximate equivalence class solution, and similarly in Figure 5 for the PPO solution with sequential Monte Carlo. Here, for each  $\alpha$  we averaged quality over all particles within a distance of 0.05 to  $\alpha$ .

We can see that PPO achieves qualitatively and quantitatively similar behavior, deviating slightly due to the approximate optimality of the PPO algorithm. To be precise, when evaluating exploitability via either solution, we find that the learned policy exploitability (see Appendix A.3) remains around  $\varepsilon \approx 2$ , compared to  $\varepsilon > 30$  for the uniform random policy. On SIS-Graphon, PPO fails, as we require softmax policy regularization to achieve satisfactory results and convergence, which is not possible in PPO as no  $Q$ -function is learned. In general, one could instead use entropy regularized policies, e.g. SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018), or alternatively use any value-based reinforcement learning method, though an investigation of the best possible approach is outside of our scope.

# 5.2 QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION OF THEOREM 3

To verify Theorem 3, we will generate  $W$ -random graphs. Note that there are considerable difficulties associated with an empirical verification of (19), since 1. for any  $N$  one must check the Nash

property for (almost) all  $N$  agents, 2. finding optimal  $\hat{\pi}$  is intractable, as no dynamic programming principle holds on the non-Markovian local agent state, while acting on the full state fails by the curse of dimensionality, and 3. the inaccuracy from estimating all  $J_{i}^{N}$ ,  $i = 1,\dots ,N$  at once by Monte Carlo increases with  $N$  from increasing variance, i.e. cost scales fast with  $N$  at fixed variance. Thus, we verify (19) or rather (26) in Appendix A.1 using the GMFE policy on systems of up to  $N = 100$  agents, i.e. using  $\hat{\pi} = \pi^{\alpha_i}$  and additionally comparing for all agents at once  $(p = 0)$ .

Shown in Figure 6, for  $W$ -random graph sequences, at each  $N$  we performed 10000 runs to estimate  $\max_i|J_i^N - J_{\alpha_i}|$ . We find that the maximum deviation between achieved returns and mean field return decreases as  $N \to \infty$ , verifying that we obtain an increasingly good approximation of the finite  $N$ -agent graph system. The oscillations in Figure 6 stem from the randomly sampled graphs.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this work, we have formulated a new framework for dense graph-based dynamical games with the weak interaction property. On the theoretical side, we have given the first general discrete-time GMFG formulation with existence conditions and approximate Nash property of the finite graph system, thus extending classical MFGs and allowing for a tractable, theoretically well-founded solution of competitive large-scale graph-based games on large dense graphs. On the practical side, we have proposed a number of computational methods to tractably compute GMFE and experimentally verified the plausibility of our methodology on a number of examples. Venues for further extensions are manifold and include extensions of theory to e.g. continuous spaces, partial observability or common noise. So far, graphons assume dense graphs and cannot properly describe sparse graphs  $(W = 0)$ , which remain an active frontier of research. Finally, real-world application scenarios may be of interest, where graphon index estimation become important for finite system model-based RL. We hope that our work inspires further applications as well as research into scalable MARL using graphical dynamical systems based on graph limit theory and mean field theory.
