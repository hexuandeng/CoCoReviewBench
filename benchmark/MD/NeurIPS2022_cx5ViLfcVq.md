# Abstract

This paper uses information-theoretic tools to analyze the generalization error in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). This study presents novel upper bounds for two notions of generalization errors. The first notion measures the gap between the population risk in the target domain and that in the source domain, and the second measures the gap between the population risk in the target domain and the empirical risk in the source domain. While our bounds for the first kind of error are in line with the traditional analysis and give similar insights, our bounds on the second kind of error are algorithm-dependent and also inspire insights into algorithm designs. Specifically, we present two simple techniques for improving generalization in UDA and validate them experimentally.

# 1 Introduction

This paper focuses on the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) task, where the learner is confronted with a source domain and a target domain and the algorithm is allowed to access to a labeled training sample from the source domain and an unlabeled training sample from the target domain. The goal is to find a predictor that performs well on the target domain.

A main obstacle in such a task is the discrepancy between the two domains. Some recent works have [1-9] proposed various measures to quantify such discrepancy, either for the UDA setting or for the more general domain generalization tasks, and many learning algorithms are proposed. For example, most recently, Nguyen et al. [9] uses a (reverse) KL divergence to measure the misalignment of the distributions of the two domains, and motivated by their generalization bound, they design an algorithm that penalizes the KL divergence between the marginal distributions of two domains in the representation space. Despite that this "KL guided domain adaptation" algorithm is demonstrated to outperform many existing marginal alignment algorithms [10, 11, 6, 12], it is not clear whether KL-based alignment of marginal distributions is adequate for UDA, and more fundamentally what role the unlabelled target-domain training sample should play to achieve cross-domain generalization. Notably, most UDA algorithms are heuristically designed and intuitively justified and most existing generalization bounds are algorithm-independent. Then there appears significant room for both deeper theoretical understanding and more principled algorithm design.

In this paper, we analyze the generalization ability of hypotheses and algorithms for UDA tasks using an information-theoretic framework developed in [13, 14]. The foundation of our bounding technique is the Donsker-Varadhan representation of KL divergence (see Lemma 3.1) with the application of sub-gaussianity (see Assumption 2). We present novel upper bounds for two notions of generalization errors. The first notion ("PP generalization error") measures the gap between the population risk in the target domain and that in the source domain for a hypothesis, and the second ("expected EP generalization error") measures the gap between the population risk in the target domain and the empirical risk in the source domain for a learning algorithm. The specific contributions of this work

are as follows. We show that the PP generalization error for all hypotheses are uniformly bounded by a quantity governed by the KL divergence between the two domain distributions, which, under bounded losses, recovers the bound in [9]. We then show that such this KL term upper-bounds some other measures including Total-Variation distance [1], Wasserstein distance [6] and domain disagreement [7]. Thus, minimizing KL-divergence forces the minimization of other discrepancy measures as well. This, together with the ease of minimizing KL [9], explains the effectiveness of the KL-guided alignment approach. For expected EP generalization error, we develop several algorithm-dependent generalization bounds. These algorithm-dependent bounds further inspire the design of two new and yet simple strategies that can further boost the performance of the KL guided marginal alignment algorithms. Experiments are performed on standard benchmarks to verify the effectiveness of these strategies.

# 2 Related Work

Domain Adaptation From a theoretical perspective, many domain adaptation generalization bounds have been developed [1, 2, 15, 3, 6, 5, 7, 8]. In particular, some discrepancy measures are designed to derive these bounds including the reduction of the total variation [1, 2, 15, 3], Wasserstein distance [6], domain disagreement [7] and so on. Motivated by the classic  $f$ -divergence, Acuna et al. [8] proposed a discrepancy measure called  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathcal{H}^{\phi}}$ -discrepancy. Since KL divergence belongs to the family of  $f$ -divergences (e.g., choosing  $x \log x$  as the Fenchel conjugate function) and both [8] and our work invoke the variational representation of the divergence, it seems our work (in Section 4) is related to theirs. However, the variational characterization of  $f$ -divergence used in [8] is based on the result of [16], and the Donsker-Varadhan representation of KL divergence (see Lemma 3.1) used in this paper cannot be directly recovered from their variational characterization [17, 18]. Indeed, simply choosing  $x \log x$  as the conjugate function will lead to a weaker bound than Lemma 3.1. Thus, our results (in Section 4) cannot be directly recovered from the results in [8]. For more details about the domain adaptation theory, we refer readers to [19] for a completed survey. From the algorithmic perspective of the domain adaptation, the most common method is to align the marginal distribution of representation between the source domain and the target domain, including using the adversarial training mechanism [10, 6, 8] and aligning the first two moments of the representation distribution [11]. There are numerous other domain adaptation and domain generalization algorithms, and we refer readers to [20-23] for recent advances.

Information-Theoretic Generalization Bounds Information-theoretic analysis are usually used to analyze the expected generalization error of supervised learning, where the training and testing data come from the same distribution [13, 24, 14, 25-29]. By exploiting the chain rule property of mutual information, these bounds are successfully applied to characterize the generalization ability of stochastic gradient based optimization algorithms [30, 26, 28, 31-33]. Recently, this framework has also been used in the multi task setting including meta-learning [34-37], semi-supervised learning [38, 39] and transfer learning [40, 34, 41, 42].

# 3 Preliminary

Unless otherwise noted, a random variable will be denoted by a capitalized letter, and its realization denoted by the corresponding lower-case letter. Consider a prediction task with instance space  $\mathcal{Z} = \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}$ , where  $\mathcal{X}$  and  $\mathcal{Y}$  are the input space and the label (or output) space respectively. Let  $\mathcal{F}$  be the hypothesis space of interesting, in which each  $f\in \mathcal{F}$  is a function or predictor mapping  $\mathcal{X}$  to  $\mathcal{Y}$ . We assume that each hypothesis  $f\in \mathcal{F}$  is parameterized by some weight parameter  $w$  in some space  $\mathcal{W}$  and may write  $f$  as  $f_{w}$  as needed.

Let  $\mu$  and  $\mu'$  be two distributions on  $\mathcal{Z}$ , unknown to the learner. Normally,  $\mu$  and  $\mu'$  are not the same and we consider  $\mu$  characterizing the source domain and  $\mu'$  characterizing the target domain. For the ease of notation, we may also write  $\mu$  as  $P_Z$  or  $P_{XY}$  and  $\mu'$  as  $P_{Z'}$  or  $P_{X'Y'}$ , which also defines random variables  $Z = (X,Y)$  and  $Z' = (X',Y')$ . Let  $S = \{Z_i\}_{i=1}^n \sim \mu^{\otimes n}$  be a labeled source-domain training sample and  $S_{X'}' = \{X_j'\}_{j=1}^m \sim P_{X'}^{\otimes m}$  be an unlabelled target-domain training sample. The objective of UDA is to design an algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  that takes  $S$  and  $S_{X'}'$  as the input and outputs a weight  $W \in \mathcal{W}$ , giving rise to a predictor  $f_W \in \mathcal{F}$  that "works well" on the target domain. Note that the algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  is in general characterized by a conditional distribution  $P_{W|S,S_X'}$ .

To be precise on the performance metric of UDA, let  $\ell : \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}_0^+$  be a loss function. Then for each weight configuration  $w \in \mathcal{W}$ , its population risk in the target domain is defined as

$$
R _ {\mu^ {\prime}} (w) \triangleq \mathbb {E} _ {Z ^ {\prime}} [ \ell \left(f _ {w} \left(X ^ {\prime}\right), Y ^ {\prime}\right) ].
$$

and a good UDA algorithm hopes to return a weight  $w$  that minimizes this risk. Since  $\mu'$  is unknown, this risk can not be measured or minimized. On the other hand, one does have access to the empirical risk in the source domain, as is defined by

$$
R _ {S} (w) \triangleq \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \ell \left(f _ {w} \left(X _ {i}\right), Y _ {i}\right).
$$

Then the notion generalization error in this setting measures how well the hypothesis returned from the algorithm generalize from the source-domain training sample to the target-domain unknown distribution  $\mu^{\prime}$ . Taking into account the stochastic nature of the algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ , a natural notion of generalization error for UDA can be defined by

$$
\operatorname {E r r} \triangleq \mathbb {E} _ {W, S} \left[ R _ {\mu^ {\prime}} (W) - R _ {S} (W) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {W, S, S _ {X ^ {\prime}} ^ {\prime}} \left[ R _ {\mu^ {\prime}} (W) - R _ {S} (W) \right], \tag {1}
$$

where the expectation in the first equation is taken over the joint distribution of  $(W,S)\sim P_{W|S}\times \mu^{\otimes n}$  and the expectation of the second equation is taken over the joint distribution of  $(W,S,S_{X^{\prime}}^{\prime})\sim$ $P_{W|S,S_{X^{\prime}}^{\prime}}\times \mu^{\otimes n}\times P_{X^{\prime}}^{\otimes m}.$

Note that there is another notion of generalization error, more traditional in the domain adaptation literature, namely, the gap between the population risk in the target domain and that in the source domain, as us define by

$$
\widetilde {\operatorname {E r r}} (w) \triangleq R _ {\mu^ {\prime}} (w) - R _ {\mu} (w). \tag {2}
$$

where  $R_{\mu}(w)\triangleq \mathbb{E}_Z[\ell (f_w(X),Y)]$  . It is apparent that  $\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}} (w)$  and Err are related by the following triangle inequality:

$$
\left| R _ {\mu^ {\prime}} (w) - R _ {S} (w) \right| \leq \left| R _ {\mu^ {\prime}} (w) - R _ {\mu} (w) \right| + \left| R _ {\mu^ {\prime}} (w) - R _ {S} (w) \right|.
$$

where the second term on the right hand side is the standard generalization error in the source domain, which can be bounded by classical learning-theoretic tools, e.g., Rademacher complexity [43]. Thus bounding  $\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w)$  helps bounding Err.

This paper studies both notions of generalization error for UDA. Specifically, starting from Section 5, we will mainly use information-theoretic tools to bound Err directly, without going through  $\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w)$ .

For the ease of reference, we refer to  $\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w)$  as the population-to-population (PP) generalization error for  $w$  and Err as the expected empirical-to-population (PP) generalization error for the algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ .

114 Some definitions are prerequisite in this paper, which we now present.

Definition 1 (Disintegrated Mutual Information). Let  $X, Y$  and  $Z$  be random variables and  $z$  be a realization of  $Z$ . The disintegrated mutual information of  $X$  and  $Y$  given  $Z = z$  is  $I^{z}(X;Y) \triangleq D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{X,Y|Z = z}||P_{X|Z = z}P_{Y|Z = z})$ .

Note that the conditional mutual information  $I(X;Y|Z) = \mathbb{E}_ZI^Z (X;Y)$ .

Definition 2 (Wasserstein Distance). Let  $d(\cdot, \cdot)$  be a metric and let  $P$  and  $Q$  be probability measures on  $\mathcal{X}$ . Denote  $\Gamma(P, Q)$  as the set of all couplings of  $P$  and  $Q$  (i.e. the set of all joint distributions on  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}$  with two marginals being  $P$  and  $Q$ ), then the Wasserstein Distance of order one between  $P$  and  $Q$  is defined as  $\mathbb{W}(P, Q) \triangleq \inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma(P, Q)} \int_{\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}} d(x, x') d\gamma(x, x')$ .

Definition 3 (Total Variation). The total variation between two probability measures  $P$  and  $Q$  is  $\operatorname{TV}(P, Q) \triangleq \sup_{E} |P(E) - Q(E)|$ , where the supremum is over all measurable set  $E$ .

Note that the total variation equals to the Wasserstein distance under the discrete metric (or Hamming distortion)  $d(x, x') = \mathbb{1}(x \neq x')$  where  $\mathbb{1}$  is the indicator function.

Definition 4 (Lautum Information [44]). Define the lautum information between  $X$  and  $Y$  as  $L(X;Y) \triangleq \mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_X P_Y \| P_{XY})$ .

The key quantity in most information-theoretic generalization bounds is the mutual information between algorithm's input and output. Specifically, the core technique behind these bounds is the well-known Donsker-Varadhan representation of KL divergence [45, Theorem 3.5].

Lemma 3.1 (Donsker and Varadhan's variational formula). Let  $Q, P$  be probability measures on  $\Theta$ , for any bounded measurable function  $f: \Theta \to \mathbb{R}$ , we have  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(Q||P) = \sup_f \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim Q}[f(\theta)] - \log \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim P}[\exp f(\theta)]$ .

# 4 Upper Bounds for PP Generalization Error

In this section, we present some upper bounds for  $\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w)$ . The key techniques used in developing these bounds are the information-theoretic tools in the style of Lemma 3.1. All these bounds adopt certain KL divergence as a key quantity measuring the discrepancy between the source and target domain. Notably, some previously established bounds are recovered under a different assumption of the loss function. Additionally, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, the KL-based bound is an upper bound of many other discrepancy measures and hence minimizing the KL divergence forces the minimization of these other measures.

We first list some common assumptions on the loss function, which we consider in this paper.

Assumption 1 (Boundedness).  $\ell (\cdot ,\cdot)$  is bounded in  $[0,M]$

Assumption 2 (Subgaussianity).  $\ell(f_w(X), Y)$  is  $R$ -subgaussian for any  $w \in \mathcal{W}$ .

Remark 4.1. Note that Assumption 1 implies Assumption 2, i.e., if  $\ell(f_w(X), Y)$  is bounded in  $[0, M]$ , then it is also  $M/2$ -subgaussian. Thus, Assumption 2 is weaker than Assumption 1.

Assumption 3 (Lipschitzness).  $\ell(f_w(X), Y)$  is  $\beta$ -Lipschitz continuous in  $\mathcal{Z}$  for any  $w \in \mathcal{W}$ , i.e.,  $|\ell(f_w(x_1), y_1) - \ell(f_w(x_2), y_2)| \leq \beta d(z_1, z_2)$ .

Remark 4.2. Note that Assumption 1 implies Assumption 3 when  $d$  is a discrete metric, i.e., if  $\ell(f_w(X), Y)$  is bounded in  $[0, M]$ , then it is also  $M$ -Lipschitz under the discrete metric.

Assumption 4 (Triangle).  $\ell (\cdot ,\cdot)$  satisfies the following the triangle inequality:  $\ell (y_1,y_2)\leq \ell (y_1,y_3) +$ $\ell (y_{3},y_{2})$  for any  $y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}\in \mathcal{V}$

# 4.1 Generalization Bounds via the Subgaussian Condition

The following generalization bound is established by combining Lemma 3.1 and Assumption 2, a technique developed in [14] for information-theoretic analysis of generalization.

Theorem 4.1. If Assumption 2 holds, then for any  $w \in \mathcal{W}$ ,  $\left|\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w)\right| \leq \sqrt{2R^2\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu'||\mu)}$ .

Theorem 4.1 bounds the gap between the population risks of two domains by the KL divergence of the two domain distributions, a quantity independent of  $w$ . It then may appear that bounds of such a kind only provide a measure of the generalization difficulty in UDA without suggesting how to deal with the difficulty. This is however not true and we now show that with a slight change of angle, such a bound can in fact provide insight in designing the learning algorithms for UDA.

Consider the same UDA problem in a representation space  $\mathcal{T}$ , namely, suppose that there is a function  $g_{\theta}$  (parametrized by  $\theta$ ) that maps each data point from the space  $\mathcal{X}$  to the representation space  $\mathcal{T}$  via  $T = g_{\theta}(X)$  and  $T' = g_{\theta}(X')$ . For any fixed  $\theta$  (and hence fixed  $g_{\theta}$ ), we may apply Theorem 4.1 to the UDA problem from  $\mathcal{T}$  to  $\mathcal{Y}$ . The KL divergence between  $\mu$  and  $\mu'$  in the theorem would become  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{T',Y'}||P_{T,Y}) = \mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{T'}||P_T) + \mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{Y'|T'}||P_{Y|T})$ . It is then possible to control  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{T',Y'}||P_{T,Y})$  via controlling  $\theta$ . In this view, the original UDA problem becomes learning a composite predictor  $f_w \circ g_{\theta}$  and one may embed  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{T',Y'}||P_{T,Y})$  or its proxy in the minimization objective function during training.

It is also remarkable that under Assumption 1 and due to Remark 4.1, Theorem 4.1 implies

$$
\left| \widetilde {\operatorname {E r r}} (w) \right| \leq \frac {M}{\sqrt {2}} \sqrt {\mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(P _ {X ^ {\prime}} \mid \mid P _ {X}\right) + \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(P _ {Y ^ {\prime} \mid X ^ {\prime}} \mid \mid P _ {Y \mid X}\right)}. \tag {3}
$$

Similarly applying this result in the representation space  $\mathcal{T}$ , we see that Eq. (3) recovers the bound in Proposition 1 of [9]. Notice that unlike [9], Theorem 4.1 (or Eq. (3)) does not require the loss to be the cross entropy loss.

Theorem 4.1 and [9] both use the KL divergence from source domain to target domain,  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu'||\mu)$ , and in fact,  $\left|\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w)\right|$  can also be upper bounded by  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu||\mu')$ . This can be done by invoking the subgaussianity of  $\ell(f_w(X'), Y')$  (rather than  $\ell(f_w(X), Y)$ ); for bounded loss, the subgaussianity of  $\ell(f_w(X'), Y')$  is also satisfied. Then we obtain the following corollary.

Corollary 4.1. If Assumption 1 holds,  $\left|\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w)\right| \leq \frac{M}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{\min\{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu||\mu'), \mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu'||\mu)\}} \leq \frac{M}{2} \sqrt{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu||\mu') + \mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu'||\mu)}$ .

In the second inequality of Corollary 4.1,  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu ||\mu^{\prime}) + \mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu^{\prime}||\mu)$  is usually called the symmetrized KL divergence (or Jeffrey's divergence [46]), and the regularization term used in [9] is indeed the symmetrized KL divergence between the distributions of the source and target representations.

In UDA, since  $Y'$  is completely unavailable to the algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$ , it is impossible to minimize the misalignment of conditional distributions, i.e.  $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{Y'|T'}||P_{Y|T})$ , without any additional information. Indeed, the misalignment of the conditional distributions appears to be the main difficulty of UDA [1, 8]. The next corollary suggests that this difficulty may be alleviated when the loss function satisfies the triangle property, namely, Assumption 4. It can be verified that this assumption is satisfied by the 0-1 loss and square error loss; this assumption has also been considered in some recent literature [3, 6].

Theorem 4.2. If Assumption 4 holds and let  $\ell(f_{w'}(X), f_w(X))$  be  $R$ -subgaussian for any  $w, w' \in \mathcal{W}$ . Then for any  $w \in \mathcal{W}$ ,  $\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w) \leq \sqrt{2R^2\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{X'}) \|P_X)} + \lambda^*$ , where  $\lambda^* = \min_{w \in \mathcal{W}} R_{\mu'}(w) + R_\mu(w)$ .

In this theorem,  $\lambda^{*}$  measures the possibility of whether the domain adaptation algorithm will succeed under the oracle knowledge of  $\mu$  and  $\mu'$ . In particular, if the hypothesis space is large enough, the minimizer  $w^{*}$  for the "joint population risk"  $R_{\mu'}(w) + R_{\mu}(w)$  may give rise to  $R_{\mu'}(w^{*}) = R_{\mu}(w^{*}) = 0$ . then we're likely to generalize well on the target domain. Then the KL divergence  $\mathrm{D}_{KL}(P_{X'}||P_X)$  between the two  $\mathcal{X}$ -margins alone bounds the PP generalization error uniformly for all  $w \in \mathcal{W}$ .

This theorem motivates the strategy of penalizing  $\mathrm{D}_{KL}(P_{T'}||P_T)$  in the representation space to achieve better a generalization error. The next theorem suggests that such an approach also penalizes other notions of domain discrepancy, for example, the one defined in [7, Definition 1.] and serving as a key quantity in the PAC-Bayes type of domain adaptation generalization bounds [7]:

$$
\left. \right. \operatorname {d i s} \left(P _ {X}, P _ {X ^ {\prime}}\right) \triangleq \left| \mathbb {E} _ {W, W ^ {\prime}, X ^ {\prime}} \left[ \ell \left(f _ {W} \left(X ^ {\prime}\right), f _ {W ^ {\prime}} \left(X ^ {\prime}\right)\right)\right] - \mathbb {E} _ {W, W ^ {\prime}, X} \left[ \ell \left(f _ {W} (X), f _ {W ^ {\prime}} (X)\right)\right]\right|.
$$

Theorem 4.3. If  $\ell(f_{w'}(X), f_w(X))$  is  $R$ -subgaussian for any  $w, w' \in \mathcal{H}$ , then  $\mathrm{dis}(P_X, P_{X'}) \leq \sqrt{2R^2 \mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{X'}||P_X)}$ .

Note that unlike [7], here we do not require the loss function to be the 0-1 loss.

# 4.2 Generalization Bounds via the Lipschitz Condition

Wasserstein distance based generalization bound are often directly connected to, or even included in, the information-theoretic bounds [47, 29]. We now present such a bound for UDA under the Lipschitz continuity assumption of the loss function.

Theorem 4.4. If Assumption 3 holds, then  $\left|\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w)\right| \leq \beta \mathbb{W}(\mu', \mu)$ .

Note that Theorem 4.4 can be related to the KL divergence based bounds in the previous section when the Wasserstein distance is defined with respect to the discrete metric  $d$ . In this case, if the loss function is bounded, it is also Lipschitz continuous, and hence Theorem 4.4 applies. On the other hand, Wasserstein distance is equivalent to the total variation distance [1, 2, 15, 3], while the latter is connected to the KL divergence via Pinsker's inequality [45, Theorem 6.5] and the Bretagnolle-Huber inequality [48, Lemma 2.1]. Thus we arrive at the following result.

Corollary 4.2. If Assumption 1 holds, holds and let  $d$  be the discrete metric, then

$$
\left| \widetilde {\operatorname {E r r}} (w) \right| \leq M \mathrm {T V} (\mu^ {\prime}, \mu) \leq M \sqrt {\min  \left\{\frac {1}{2} \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} (\mu^ {\prime} | | \mu) , 1 - e ^ {- \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} (\mu^ {\prime} | | \mu)} \right\}}.
$$

The bound in Corollary 4.2 can be immediately verified to be tighter than the bound in Eq. (3).

Parallel to Theorem 4.2, if the loss function satisfies the triangle property, we may establish another bound below, which recovers a similar result in [6, Theorem 1.].

Theorem 4.5. If Assumption 4 holds and  $\ell(f_w(X), f_{w'}(X))$  is  $\beta$ -Lipschitz in  $\mathcal{X}$  for any  $w, w' \in \mathcal{W}$ , then for any  $w \in \mathcal{W}$ ,  $\widetilde{\mathrm{Err}}(w) \leq L\mathbb{W}(P_{X'}, P_X) + \lambda^*$ , where  $\lambda^* = \min_{w \in \mathcal{W}} R_{\mu'}(w) + R_\mu(w)$ .

Unlike the bound in [6], we do not require the classification tasks to be binary in Theorem 4.5, and the loss does not need to be the  $L_{1}$  distance.

This section may convey the following message. Since the KL divergence based bounds upper bounds those based on other measures of domain differences, (e.g. total variation distance, domain discrepancy etc), if we penalize the KL divergence, we will also penalize those other measures. This is practically advantageous since it is usually easier and more stable to minimize the KL divergence[9].

# 5 Upper Bounds for Expected EP Generalization Error and Applications

There are two limitations in the bounds on the PP generalization error developed in the previous section and in the traditional analysis of domain adaptation. First, such bounds are independent of  $w$  and hence algorithm-independent. Second, although these bounds may inspire strategies to exploit the unlabelled target sample, e.g., aligning its marginal distribution with that of the source sample in the representation space, they only provide very limited knowledge on the role that the unlabelled target sample plays in the algorithm. We now derive upper bounds for the EP generalization error, which better utilize the dependence of the algorithm output on the unlabelled target data. Applications of these bounds in designing the learning algorithms are also presented.

# 5.1 Bounds

Theorem 5.1. Assume  $\ell(f_w(X'), Y')$  is  $R$ -subgaussian for any  $w \in \mathcal{W}$ . Then

$$
| \operatorname {E r r} | \leq \frac {1}{n m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \mathbb {E} _ {X _ {j} ^ {\prime}} \sqrt {2 R ^ {2} I ^ {X _ {j} ^ {\prime}} (W ; Z _ {i})} + \sqrt {2 R ^ {2} \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} (\mu | | \mu^ {\prime})}.
$$

Note that the unlabelled target data plays a role in the first term of the bound.

Corollary 5.1. Let Assumption 1 hold. Then

$$
| \mathrm {E r r} | \leq \frac {M}{\sqrt {2} n m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \mathbb {E} _ {X _ {j} ^ {\prime}} \sqrt {\min \left\{I ^ {X _ {j} ^ {\prime}} (W ; Z _ {i}) , L ^ {X _ {j} ^ {\prime}} (W ; Z _ {i}) \right\}} + \frac {M}{\sqrt {2}} \sqrt {\min \left\{\mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} (\mu | | \mu^ {\prime}) , \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} (\mu^ {\prime} | | \mu) \right\}}.
$$

where  $L^{X_j'}(\cdot ;\cdot)$  is the disintegrated version of Lautum information.

Theorem 5.2. Assume  $\ell$  is Lipschitz for both  $w\in \mathcal{W}$  and  $z\in \mathcal{Z}$ , i.e.,  $|\ell (w,z) - \ell (w,z^{\prime})|\leq \beta d_{1}(z,z^{\prime})$  for all  $z,z^{\prime}\in \mathcal{Z}$  and  $|\ell (w,z) - \ell (w^{\prime},z)|\leq \beta^{\prime}d_{2}(w,w^{\prime})$  for all  $w,w^{\prime}\in \mathcal{W}$ , then

$$
| \operatorname {E r r} | \leq \frac {\beta^ {\prime}}{n m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \mathbb {E} _ {X _ {j} ^ {\prime}, Z _ {i}} \mathbb {W} \left(P _ {W | Z _ {i}, X _ {j} ^ {\prime}}, P _ {W | X _ {j} ^ {\prime}}\right) + \beta \mathbb {W} (\mu , \mu^ {\prime}).
$$

This bound is tighter than the bound in Theorem 5.1, as can be indicated by the following corollary.

Corollary 5.2. Let Assumption 1 hold. Then

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left| \widetilde {\operatorname {E r r}} \right| \leq \frac {M}{n m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \mathbb {E} _ {X _ {j} ^ {\prime}, Z _ {i}} \left[ \mathrm {T V} \left(P _ {W | Z _ {i}, X _ {j} ^ {\prime}}, P _ {W | X _ {j} ^ {\prime}}\right) \right] + M \mathrm {T V} (\mu , \mu^ {\prime}) \\ \leq \frac {1}{n m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \mathbb {E} _ {X _ {j} ^ {\prime}, Z _ {i}} \sqrt {\frac {M ^ {2}}{2} \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} (P _ {W | Z _ {i} , X _ {j} ^ {\prime}} | | P _ {W | X _ {j} ^ {\prime}})} + \sqrt {\frac {M ^ {2}}{2} \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} (\mu | | \mu^ {\prime})}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Notice that to recover Theorem 5.1 from Corollary 5.2, we can use Jensen's inequality to move the expectation over  $Z_{i}$  inside the convex square root function.

# 5.2 Gradient Penalty as an Universal Regularizer

The algorithm-dependent bound in Theorem 5.1 tells us that one can reduce the expected generalization error by limiting the disintegrated mutual information  $I^{X_j'}(W;Z_i)$ . In the stochastic gradient based optimization algorithms, this term can be controlled by penalizing the gradient. To see this, we now consider a "noisy" iterative algorithm for updating  $W$ , e.g., SGLD. At each time step  $t$ , let the labelled mini-batch from the source domain be  $Z_{B_t}$ , let the unlabelled mini-batch from the target domain be  $X_{B_t}'$ , and let  $g(W_{t-1},Z_{B_t},X_{B_t}')$  be the gradient at time  $t$ . Thus, the updating rule of  $W$  is  $W_t = W_{t-1} - \eta_t g(W_{t-1},Z_{B_t},X_{B_t}') + N_t$  where  $\eta_t$  is the learning rate and  $N_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2\mathrm{I}_d)$  is an isotropic Gaussian noise. The next theorem is an application of Theorem 5.1 in this setting.

Theorem 5.3. Let the total iteration number be  $T$  and let  $G_{t} = g(W_{t - 1},Z_{B_{t}},X_{B_{t}}^{\prime})$ , then

$$
| \mathrm {E r r} | \leq \sqrt {\frac {R ^ {2}}{n} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \frac {\eta_ {t} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {t} ^ {2}} \mathbb {E} _ {S _ {X ^ {\prime}} ^ {\prime} , W _ {t - 1} , S} \left[ | | G _ {t} | | ^ {2} \right]} + \sqrt {2 R ^ {2} \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} (\mu | | \mu^ {\prime})}.
$$

Remark 5.1. Considering a noisy iterative algorithm here is to simplify analysis. In fact it is also possible to analyze the original iterative gradient optimization method without noise injected. For example, one can follow the same development in [32, 33] to analyze vanilla SGD. In that case, there will be some additional terms in the bound, which are related to flatness of the found minima.

Theorem 5.3 hints that to reduce the generalization error, one can restrict the gradient norm at each step. This strategy will also restrict the distance between the final output  $W_{T}$  and the initialization  $W_{0}$ , effectively shrinking the hypothesis space accessible by the algorithm.

Indeed, adding gradient penalty can be applied to any existing UDA algorithm and it is simple but effective in practice. Later on we will show that even when the algorithm  $\mathcal{A}$  does not access to any target data, in which case  $I(W;Z_{i}|X_{j}^{\prime})$  reduces to  $I(W;Z_{i})$  and  $g(W_{t - 1},Z_{B_t},X_{B_t}^{\prime})$  becomes  $g(W_{t - 1},Z_{B_t})$ , minimizing the empirical loss of source domain sample while penalizing gradient norm will still improve the performance. Notice that gradient penalty is also used in Wasserstein distance based adversarial training [49, 6], and their motivation is to stabilize the training to avoid gradient vanishing problem while here we use it to improve the generalization performance directly.

Notably the bound in Theorem 5.3 only depends on the size  $n$  of labelled source sample and does not explicitly depend on  $m$ , the size of unlabelled target sample. With a more careful design, if we consider the mutual information as the expected KL divergence of a posterior and a prior, based on  $I^{X_j^t}(W;Z_i)$  in Theorem 5.1, it is possible to create a target data dependent prior and derive a tighter bound based on some quantity similar to "gradient incoherence" in [26]. As this will introduce additional complexity in practice, we leave this as a future study.

# 5.3 Controlling Label Information for KL Guided Marginal Alignment

Consider instances in the representation space,  $Z = (T,Y)$  and  $Z' = (T',Y)$ . Theorem 5.1 also encourage us to align the distributions of two domains in the representation space, as argued earlier. Then the KL guided marginal alignment algorithm proposed in [9] can be invoked here. One may notice that Theorem 5.1 uses  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu ||\mu ')$  while [9] uses  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(\mu '||\mu)$ . As already discussed in Section 4, this inconsistency can be ignored when loss is bounded (see Corollary 5.1).

Most domain adaptation algorithms aim to align the marginal distributions of two domains in the representation space. However, without accessing to  $Y'$ , it remains unknown if an UDA algorithm will work well since we cannot guarantee that discrepancy between conditional distribution  $P_{Y|T}$  and  $P_{Y'|T'}$  won't become too large when we align the marginals. In [9], the authors show that  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{Y'|T'}||P_{Y|T})$  can be upper-bounded by  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{Y'|X'}||P_{Y|X})$ , if  $I(X;Y) = I(T;Y)$ . The authors then argue that penalizing the KL divergence of the marginals distributions is safe.

We now argue that in practice the condition  $I(X;Y) = I(T;Y)$  can be difficult to satisfy if the cross-entropy loss is used to define the source-domain empirical risk.

By data processing inequality on  $Y - X - T$ , we know that  $I(X;Y) \geq I(T;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|T)$ . Thus, to let  $I(T;Y)$  reach its maximum, one must minimize  $H(Y|T)$ . On the other hand, let  $Q_{Y|T,W}$  be the predictive distribution of labels in the source domain generated by the classifier. The expected cross-entropy loss for each  $Z_i$  in the representation space is then

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {W, Z _ {i}} \left[ \ell \left(f _ {W} \left(T _ {i}\right), Y _ {i}\right) \right] = \mathbb {E} _ {Z _ {i}} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {W | Z _ {i}} \left[ - \log Q _ {Y _ {i} | T _ {i}, W} \right] \right],
$$

298 which also decomposes as [50, 51]

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {W, Z _ {i}} \left[ \ell \left(f _ {W} \left(T _ {i}\right), Y _ {i}\right) \right] = H \left(Y _ {i} \mid T _ {i}\right) + \mathbb {E} _ {T _ {i}, W} \left[ \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} \left(P _ {Y _ {i} \mid T _ {i}, W} \mid \left| Q _ {Y _ {i} \mid T _ {i}, W}\right) \right] - I \left(W; Y _ {i} \mid T _ {i}\right). \right. \tag {4}
$$

Then minimizing the expected cross-entropy loss may not adequately reduce  $H(Y_{i}|T_{i})$  but rather cause  $I(W;Y_{i}|T_{i})$  to significantly increase, particularly when the model capacity is large. This may have two negative effects. First, the condition  $I(X;Y) = I(T;Y)$  is significantly violated, and  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{Y'|T'}||P_{Y|T})$  is no longer upper bounded by  $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P_{Y'|X'}||P_{Y|X})$ . As a consequence, aligning the two marginals alone may not be adequate. Second, large  $I(W;Y_{i}|T_{i})$  indicates  $W$  just simply memorizes the label  $Y_{i}$ , resulting in a form of overfitting and hurting the generalization performance.

The key take-away from the above analysis is that when aligning the marginals in UDA, controlling the source label information in the weights can be important to achieve good cross-domain generalization. A similar message can also be deduced from Theorem 5.1, when it is viewed in the repentation space and noting  $I^{T_j'}(W;Z_i) = I^{T_j'}(W;T_i) + I^{T_j'}(W;Y_i|T_i)$ .

To control label information, [51] proposed an approach called LIMIT. However this method is rather complicated and arguably hard to train in domain adaptation (see Appendix). We now derive a simple alternative strategy for this purpose.

Notice that  $I^{T_j'}(W;Y_i|T_i)\leq \inf_Q\mathbb{E}_{T_i}\left[\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P(W|Y_i,T_i,T_j' = t_j')||Q(W|T_i,T_j' = t_j'))\right]$ , which is a simple extension of variational representation of mutual information [45, Corollary 3.1]. Here  $Q$  could be any distribution. By assuming  $P = \mathcal{N}(W,\sigma^2\mathrm{I}_d|Y_i,T_i,T_j' = t_j')$  and taking  $Q = \mathcal{N}(\widetilde{W},\tilde{\sigma}^2\mathrm{I}_d|T_i,T_j' = t_j')$ , we have

$$
I ^ {T _ {j} ^ {\prime}} (W; Y _ {i} | T _ {i}) \leq \inf  _ {Q} \mathbb {E} _ {T _ {i}} \left[ \mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {K L}} (P (W | Y _ {i}, T _ {i}, T _ {j} ^ {\prime} = t _ {j} ^ {\prime}) | | Q (\tilde {W} | T _ {i}, T _ {j} ^ {\prime} = t _ {j} ^ {\prime})) \right] \propto | | W - \widetilde {W} | | ^ {2}.
$$

Thus, we may create an auxiliary classifier  $f_{\widetilde{w}}$  that is not allowed to access to the real source label  $Y$ . In each iteration, we use the pseudo labels of target data (and source data) assigned by  $f_{w}$  to train  $f_{\widetilde{w}}$  and adding  $||W - \widetilde{W}||^2$  as a regularizer in the training of  $W$ . The algorithm is given in the Appendix. Remarkably the regularizer here resembles "Projection Norm" designed in [52] for out-of-distribution generalization.

# 322 6 Experimental Results

We now perform experiments to verify the proposed techniques inspired by our theory in the previous section. The experimental setup follows that in [9].

Datasets We select two popular small datasets, RotatedMNIST and Digits, to compare the different methods. In particular, RotatedMNIST is built based on the MNIST dataset [53] and consists of six domains with each domain containing 11,666 images. These six domains are rotated MNIST images with rotation angle  $0^{\circ}$ ,  $15^{\circ}$ ,  $30^{\circ}$ ,  $45^{\circ}$ ,  $60^{\circ}$  and  $75^{\circ}$ , respectively. We will take the original MNIST dataset  $(0^{\circ})$  as the source domain and take other five domains as target domains. Hence there are five domain adaptation tasks on RotatedMNIST. Digits consists of three sub-datasets, namely MNIST, USPS [54] and SVHN [55], and the corresponding domain adaptation tasks are MNIST  $\rightarrow$  USPS  $(\mathbf{M} \rightarrow \mathbf{U})$ , USPS  $\rightarrow$  MNIST  $(\mathbf{U} \rightarrow \mathbf{M})$ , SVHN  $\rightarrow$  MNIST  $(\mathbf{S} \rightarrow \mathbf{M})$ .

Compared Methods Baseline methods are some popular marginal alignment UDA methods including DANN [10], MMD [12], CORAL [11], WD [6] and KL [9]. We also choose ERM for another baseline in which the algorithm can only access to the source domain sample during training. To verify the strategies inspired by our theory, we first add the gradient penalty to the ERM algorithm (ERM-GP), and we then combine gradient penalty (GP) and controlling label information (CL) with the recent proposed KL guided marginal alignment method, which are denoted by KL-GP and KL-CL, respectively.

Implementation Details Most part of the implementation is based on the famous DomainBed suite [56]. Other settings are exactly the same with [9] and the results of baseline methods are reported directly from [9]. Specifically, each algorithm is run three times and we show the average performance with the error bar. Every dataset has a validation set, and the model selection scheme is based on the best performance achieved on the validation set of target domain during training (oracle). The hype-parameter searching process is also built upon the implementation in the DomainBed suite. Other details and additional experiments can be found in Appendix.

Results From Table 1, we first notice that gradient penalty is able to help ERM to be more comparable with other marginal alignment methods. For example, on RotatedMNIST, ERM-GP outperforms CORAL and performs nearly the same with DANN. On Digits, ERM-GP outperforms WD. When GP and CL combined with KL guided algorithm, we can see that the performance can be further boosted. This justifies the discussion in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3.

# 7 Conclusion

Despite that the numerous learning techniques have been developed for domain adaptation, significant room exists for more in-depth theoretical understanding and more principled design of learning algorithms. This paper presents the first information-theoretic analysis for unsupervised domain adaptation, where we query two notions of the generalization errors in this context and present novel learning bounds. Some of these bounds recover the previous KL-based bounds under different conditions and confirm the insights in the learning algorithms that align the source and target distributions in the representation space. Our other bounds are algorithm-dependent, better exploiting the unlabelled target data, which have inspired novel and yet simple schemes for the design of learning algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these schemes on standard benchmark datasets.

# Limitations

A central notion in our bounds is KL divergence (which includes mutual information as a special case). Although generic and universally applicable, KL divergence has a fundamental limitation in capturing the natural metric in the underlying space, which may cause the bounds incapable of extracting certain structural properties in some settings.

In the mutual information-based bounds, the key random variable is weight  $W$ . For over-parametrized models, this variable may not be sufficiently indicative as the algorithm's output. Replacing  $W$  by a random variable on the space  $\mathcal{F}$  of classifiers may lead to tighter bounds.

This work has not touch upon the fundamental difficulty in UDA, or the lower bounds of generalization errors.
