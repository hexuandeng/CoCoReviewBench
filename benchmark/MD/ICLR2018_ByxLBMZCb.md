# ABSTRACT

With the increasing interest in deeper understanding of the loss surface of many non-convex deep models, this paper presents a unifying framework to study the local/global equivalence of the optimization problem arising from training of such non-convex models. Using the local openness property of the underlying training models, we provide sufficient conditions under which any local optimum of the resulting optimization problem is global. Our result unifies and extends many of the existing results in the literature. For example, our theory shows that when the input data matrix  $X$  is full row rank, all non-degenerate local optima of the optimization problem for training linear deep model with squared loss error are global minima. Moreover, for two layer linear models, we show that all degenerate critical points are either global or second order saddles and the non-degenerate local optima are global. Unlike many existing results in the literature, our result assumes no assumption on the target data matrix  $Y$ . For non-linear deep models having certain pyramidal structure with invertible activation functions, we can show global/local equivalence with no assumption on the differentiability of the activation function. Our results are the direct consequence of our main theorem that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the matrix multiplication mapping to be locally open in its range.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep learning models have recently led to significant practical successes in various fields ranging from computer vision to natural language processing. Despite these significant empirical successes, the theoretical understanding of the behavior of these models is still very limited. While some works have tried to explain these successes through the lenses of expressivity of these models by showing their power in learning large class of mappings, other works find the root of the success in the generalizability of these models from learning perspective.

From optimization perspective, training deep models typically requires solving non-convex optimization problem due to the "deep" structure of the model. In fact, it has been shown by Blum & Rivest (1989) that training neural networks to global optimality is NP-complete in the worst case even for the simple case of three node networks. Despite this worst case barrier, the practical success of deep learning may suggest that most of the local optima of these models are close to the global optima. In particular, Choromanska et al. (2015) use spin glass theory and empirical experiments to show that the local optima of deep neural network optimization problem are close to the global optima.

In an effort to better understand the landscape of training deep neural networks, Kawaguchi (2016); Lu & Kawaguchi (2017); Yun et al. (2017); Hardt & Ma (2016) studied the linear neural networks and provide sufficient conditions under which critical points (or local optima) of the optimization problem are globally optimal. For non-linear neural networks, various works have shown that when the number of parameters of the model is larger than the data dimension, then the local optima of the resulting optimization problems are easy and they can be found through local search procedures; see, e.g., Soltanolkotabi et al. (2017); Soudry & Carmon (2016); Nguyen & Hein (2017); Xie et al. (2017).

Despite the growing interest in studying the landscape of deep optimization problems, many of the results and mathematical analyses are problem specific and cannot be generalized to other problems

and network structures easily. As a first step toward reaching a unifying theory for these results, we propose the use of open mappings for characterizing the properties of the local optima of an optimization problem.

To study the landscape of shallow/deep models, let us start by the general optimization problem

$$
\underset {w \in \mathcal {W}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \ell (\mathcal {F} (w)) \tag {1}
$$

for training of a learning model. Here  $\ell(\cdot)$  is the loss function and  $\mathcal{F}(\cdot)$  represents a statistical model with parameter  $w$  which needs to be learned by solving the above optimization problem. A simple example is the popular linear regression problem:

$$
\underset {w} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \| X w - y \| _ {2} ^ {2},
$$

where  $y$  is a given constant response vector and  $X$  is a given constant feature matrix. In this example, the loss function is the  $\ell_2$  loss, i.e.,  $\ell(z) = \|z - y\|_2^2$ , and the fitted model  $\mathcal{F}$  is a linear model, i.e.,  $\mathcal{F}(w) = Xw$ . While this linear regression problem is convex and easy, fitting many practical models, such as deep neural networks, requires solving non-trivial non-convex optimization problems. In addition to the training of deep neural networks, the well-studied matrix completion problem also lies in this category of non-convex problems. For this matrix completion problem, Park et al. (2016) shows that the non-convex matrix factorization formulation of the non-square matrix sensing problem has no spurious local optimum under restricted isometry property (RIP) conditions. Similar results were obtained for the symmetric matrix multiplication problem by Ge et al. (2016), and the non-convex factorized low-rank matrix recovery problem by Bhojanapalli et al. (2016). In this paper, we use the local openness of the mapping  $\mathcal{F}$  to provide sufficient conditions under which every local optimum is in fact global.

To proceed, let us define our notations that will be used throughout the paper. We use the notation  $A_{l,:}$ , and  $A_{:,l}$  to denote the  $l^{th}$  row and column of matrix  $A$  respectively. Let  $\| A\|$ ,  $\mathcal{N}(A)$ ,  $\mathcal{C}(A)$ ,  $r_A$  be the respective Frobenius norm, null space, column space, and rank of  $A$ . Given subspaces  $U$  and  $V$ , we say  $U \perp V$  if  $U$  is orthogonal to  $V$ , and  $U = V^\perp$  if  $U$  is the orthogonal complement of  $V$ . We say matrix  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_0}$  is rank deficient if  $\mathrm{rank}(A) < \min(d_1, d_0)$ , and full rank if  $\mathrm{rank}(A) = \min(d_1, d_0)$ . We call a point  $W = (W_h, \ldots, W_1)$  non-degenerate if  $\mathrm{rank}(W) = \min_{0 \leq i \leq h} d_i$ , and degenerate if  $\mathrm{rank}(W) < \min_{0 \leq i \leq h} d_i$ . We also say a point  $W = (W_h, \ldots, W_1)$  is a second order saddle point if the hessian of the loss function at  $W$  has a negative eigenvalue.

Let us start by briefly highlighting two problems which will be used as a motivation for our analysis:

Feedforward Neural Networks: Consider the following multiple layer feedforward neural network optimization problem:

$$
\underset {W} {\operatorname {m i n i m i z e}} \frac {1}{2} \| \mathcal {F} _ {h} (W) - Y \| _ {F} ^ {2} \quad \text {w i t h} \quad \mathcal {F} _ {1} (W) \triangleq \sigma_ {1} (W _ {1} X), \quad \mathcal {F} _ {k} (W) \triangleq \sigma_ {k} \big (W _ {k} \mathcal {F} _ {k - 1} (W) \big),
$$

for  $k \in [2, h]$ , where  $\sigma_k(\cdot), k = 1, \ldots, h$ , are the activation functions for different layers,  $W = (W_i)_{i=1}^h$ ,  $W_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i \times d_{i-1}}$  are the weight matrices,  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0 \times n}$  is the input training data, and  $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h \times n}$  is the target training data, see Goodfellow & Courville (2016). To obtain the representation in (1), we need to set our loss function to the  $\ell_2$  loss, and set  $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}_h$ .

A special instance of this optimization problem was studied in Nguyen & Hein (2017), which considers the non-linear neural network with pyramidal structure (i.e.  $d_{i} \leq d_{i-1} \forall i = 1, \ldots, h$  and  $d_{0} \geq n$ ). (Nguyen & Hein, 2017, Theorem 3.8) shows that under some conditions, among which are the differentiability of the loss function  $\ell(\cdot)$  and the activation function  $\sigma(\cdot)$ , if  $W$  is a critical point with  $W_{i}$ 's being full row rank then it is a global minimum. In our paper, we show that by relaxing the differentiability condition on both  $\ell(\cdot)$  and  $\sigma(\cdot)$ , we can still obtain a similar result under very minimal set of assumptions.

Another special case is the linear feedforward networks where the mapping  $\sigma_k(\cdot)$  is the identity map in all layers:

$$
\underset {W} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \frac {1}{2} \| W _ {h} \dots W _ {1} X - Y \| _ {F} ^ {2}. \tag {2}
$$

For this optimization problem Lu & Kawaguchi (2017) showed that every local optimum of the objective function is globally optimal under some assumptions. More precisely, by using perturbation

analysis, (Lu & Kawaguchi, 2017, Theorem 2.2) prove that when  $X$  and  $Y$  are full row rank, every local optimum in problem (2) is a local optimum in problem (3).

$$
\underset {Z \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {h} \times n}} {\text {m i n i m u m}} \frac {1}{2} | | Z X - Y | | _ {F} ^ {2} \tag {3}
$$

$$
\text {s u b j e c t} \quad \operatorname {r a n k} (Z) \leq d _ {p} \triangleq \min  _ {0 \leq i \leq h} d _ {i}
$$

Moreover, they show that when  $X$  is full row rank, every local optimum of problem (3) is a global optimum. Thus, with the sufficient condition of  $X$  and  $Y$  being both full row rank, every local optimum of problem (2) is a global optimum. Yun et al. (2017) also show that the same result hold when  $XX^T$  and  $YX^T$  are both full rank. It is in fact not hard to see that one cannot relax the full rankness assumption of  $Y$  due to the following simple example:

$$
X = I \quad W _ {3} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right], \quad W _ {2} = [ 0 ], \quad W _ {1} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \end{array} \right], \quad Y = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]
$$

which is a local optimum of 3-layer deep linear model (problem (2) with  $h = 3$ ) that is not global. However, if a given local optima is non-degenerate (which is a simple checkable condition), the full rankness of  $Y$  can be relaxed. In particular, we will show that if  $X$  is full row rank, then every non-degenerate critical point is either a global optimum or a saddle point, thus relaxing the full row rank assumption on  $Y$ .

Non-symmetric Matrix Completion and Matrix Factorization: Consider the following non-symmetric matrix completion optimization problem:

$$
\underset {W _ {1} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {1} \times d _ {0}}, W _ {2} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {2} \times d _ {1}}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \frac {1}{2} \| \Omega (W _ {2} W _ {1} - Y) \| _ {F} ^ {2} \tag {4}
$$

where  $\Omega$  is a linear mapping that represents the sensing process and  $Y\in \mathbb{R}^{d_2\times d_0}$  is a low rank target matrix. When  $\Omega$  only selects a subset of entries, we get the famous Netflix prize problem, see Koren (2009). When  $\Omega$  is the identity mapping, this problem becomes the low rank matrix estimation problem described in Srebro & Jaakkola (2003), which can be seen as a 2-layer linear neural network optimization problem

$$
\underset {W _ {1} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {1} \times d _ {0}}, W _ {2} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {2} \times d _ {1}}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \frac {1}{2} \| W _ {2} W _ {1} X - Y \| _ {F} ^ {2} \tag {5}
$$

with  $X = I$ . In problem (5), the loss function is the  $\ell_2$  loss, and the mapping  $\mathcal{F}$  is defined as  $\mathcal{F}(W_1, W_2) = W_2W_1$ . In this paper, we show the following results for problem (5):

- Every degenerate critical point of (5) is either a global minimum or a second-order saddle point. This result can be generalized to general loss function  $\ell(\cdot)$ .  
- We show that for problem (5), if  $X$  is full row rank, then every non-degenerate critical point is either a global minimum or a saddle point.

In addition to these results, we completely characterize the local openness of the matrix product map in its range. This result could be used in many other optimization problems for characterizing the local/global equivalence.

# 2 MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK

As discussed in the previous section, we are interested in solving

$$
\underset {w \in \mathcal {W}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \ell (\mathcal {F} (w)) \tag {6}
$$

where  $\mathcal{F}:\mathcal{W}\mapsto S$  is a mapping and  $\ell :S\mapsto \mathbb{R}$  is a loss function. Here we assume the set  $\mathcal{W}$  is closed and the mapping  $\mathcal{F}$  is continuous. In non-convex scenarios, this optimization problem can only be solved up to "local optima" by local search procedures; see Lee et al. (2016) for an example. In this paper, we study problems (6) and (7), and provide sufficient conditions under which any

local optimum is in fact global. To proceed with our analysis, we define the auxiliary optimization problem

$$
\underset {s \in S} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \ell (s) \tag {7}
$$

where  $S$  is the range of the mapping  $\mathcal{F}$ . Since problem (7) minimizes the function  $\ell(\cdot)$  over the range of the mapping  $\mathcal{F}$ , the global optimal objective values for problems (6) and (7) are the same. Moreover, there is a connection between the global optima of the two optimization problems through the mapping  $\mathcal{F}$ . However, the connection between the local optima of the two optimization problems is not clear. This connection is in particular important when the local optima of (7) are "nice" (e.g. globally optimal or close to optimal). In what follows, we establish the connection between the local optima of the optimization problems (6) and (7) under some simple sufficient conditions. This connection is then used to study the relation between local and global optima of (6) and (7) for various deep learning models. Let us first define the following concepts:

Definition: A mapping  $\mathcal{F}:\mathcal{W}\to \mathcal{S}$  is said to be open, if for every open set  $U\in \mathcal{W}$ ,  $\mathcal{F}(U)$  is (relatively) open in  $\mathcal{S}$ . The mapping  $\mathcal{F}(w)$  is said to be locally open at  $w$  if for every  $\epsilon >0$ , there exists  $\delta >0$  such that  $\mathcal{B}_{\delta}\bigl (\mathcal{F}(w)\bigr)\subset \mathcal{F}\bigl (\mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}(w)\bigr)$ , where  $\mathcal{B}_{\delta}(w)\subseteq \mathcal{W}$  is a ball with radius  $\delta$  centered at  $w$ , and  $\mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}(\mathcal{F}(w))\subseteq S$  is a ball of radius  $\epsilon$  centered at  $\mathcal{F}(w)$ . A useful property of (locally) open mappings is that the composition of two (locally) open maps is (locally) open.

We now state a simple intuitive result that allows us to establish a connection between the local optima of (6) and (7).

Observation 1. Suppose  $\mathcal{F}(\bar{w})$  is locally open at  $\bar{w}$ . If  $\bar{w}$  is a local minimum of problem (6), then  $\bar{s} = \mathcal{F}(\bar{w})$  is a local minimum of problem (7).

Figure 1: Sketch of the Proof of Observation 1.

Proof. Let  $\bar{w}$  be a local minimum of problem (6). Then there exists  $\epsilon > 0$  such that  $\ell(\mathcal{F}(\bar{w})) \leq \ell(\mathcal{F}(w))$ ,  $\forall w \in \mathcal{B}_{\epsilon}(\bar{w})$ . By the definition of local openness,

$$
\exists \delta > 0 \text {s u c h t h a t} \mathcal {B} _ {\delta} (\bar {s}) \subset \mathcal {F} \left(\mathcal {B} _ {\epsilon} (\bar {w})\right) \Rightarrow \ell (\bar {s}) \leq \ell (s), \forall s \in \mathcal {B} _ {\delta} (s)
$$

which implies  $\bar{s}$  is a local minimum of problem (7).

Furthermore, if every local optimum of (7) is global, the above result implies that any local optimum of (6) is also global. This simple Lemma motivates us to study the local openness of some popular mappings, through which we can establish the local/global equivalence for various classes of optimization problems.

An example of a mapping that is widely used in many optimization problems, such as deep neural networks (2) and matrix completion (5), is the matrix multiplication mapping defined as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {M}: \mathbb {R} ^ {m \times k} \times \mathbb {R} ^ {k \times n} \mapsto \mathcal {R} _ {\mathcal {M}} ^ {u} \triangleq \left\{Z \in \mathbb {R} ^ {m \times n} \text {w i t h} \operatorname {r a n k} (Z) \leq u \triangleq \min  (m, n, k) \right\} \\ \text {w i t h} \quad \mathcal {M} (X, Y) \triangleq X Y. \tag {8} \\ \end{array}
$$

Although, the matrix multiplication mappings  $\mathcal{M}(X,Y)$  appears naturally in deep models and is widely used as a non-convex factorization for rank constrained problems, see Wang et al. (2016); Bhojanapalli et al. (2016); Ge et al. (2016); Srebro & Jaakkola (2003); Sun (2015), to our knowledge,

the complete characterization of the openness of this mapping has not been studied in the optimization literature before. This motivated us to study the openness/local openness of the mapping  $\mathcal{M}$  as one of our initial steps.

While the classical open mapping theorem in Rudin (1973) states that surjective continuous linear operators are open, this is not true in general for bilinear mappings such as matrix product. In fact, by providing a simple counterexample of a bilinear mapping that is not open, Horowitz (1975) shows that the linear case cannot be generally extended to multilinear maps. Several papers, see Balcerzak et al. (2013; 2005); Behrends (2011), investigate this bilinear mapping and provide a characterization of the points where this mapping is open. Moreover, Behrends (2017) studies the matrix multiplication mapping  $\mathcal{M}$  which is a special example of bilinear mappings and also provides a complete characterization of the points where the mapping is locally open. However, in their study they consider the range of the mapping to be  $\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ , and not  $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{M}}^u$ ; which due to the constraint of problem (7) that defines the feasible region to be the range of the mapping  $\mathcal{F}$ , does not allow us to establish the connection between local optima of problems (6) and (7). For that reason, we study the local openness of the mapping  $\mathcal{M}$  in its range  $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{M}}^u$ . An intuitive definition of local openness of  $\mathcal{M}(X,Y)$  at  $(X,Y)$  in  $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{M}}^u$  is as follows. We say the multiplication mapping is locally open at  $(X,Y)$  if for any small perturbation  $\tilde{Z}\in \mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{M}}^u$  of  $Z = XY$ , there exists a pair  $(\tilde{X},\tilde{Y})$ , small perturbations of  $(X,Y)$ , such that  $\tilde{Z} = \tilde{X}\tilde{Y}$ .

Notice that when  $k \geq \min(m, n)$ , then  $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{M}}^{\min(m, n)} = \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ . However, in the case where  $k < \min(m, n)$  the mapping is definitely not locally open in  $\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ , but can still be locally open in  $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{M}}^k$ . As a simple example, consider  $X = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2 \end{array} \right]$  and  $Y = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 1 \end{array} \right]$ , then there does not exist  $\tilde{X}, \tilde{Y}$  perturbations of  $X$  and  $Y$  respectively such that  $\tilde{X}\tilde{Y} = \tilde{Z}$  when  $\tilde{Z}$  is a full rank perturbation of  $Z = XY$ ; however, for any rank 1 perturbation  $\tilde{Z}$  of  $Z = XY$ , we can find a perturbed pair  $(\tilde{X},\tilde{Y})$  such that  $\tilde{Z} = \tilde{X}\tilde{Y}$ . Motivated by Observation 1, we study in the next section the local openness of the mapping  $\mathcal{M}$ . We later use these results to analyze the behavior of local optima of deep neural networks.

# 3 LOCAL OPENNESS OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION MAPPING

Consider  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$  and  $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$  with  $k \geq \min(m, n)$ . Then the range of the mapping  $\mathcal{M}$  is the entire space  $\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ . In this case, (Behrends, 2017, Theorem 2.5) provides a complete characterization of the pairs  $(X, Y)$  where the mapping is locally open. However, when  $k \leq \min(m, n)$ , i.e., the product of the matrix is rank deficient, the characterization of the set of points for which the mapping is locally open remains an unresolved problem. We settled this question in Theorem 3 in this section which provides a complete characterization of points  $(X, Y)$  for which the mapping  $\mathcal{M}$  is locally open when  $k < \min(m, n)$ . Let us start by restating the main result in Behrend's (2017):

Proposition 2. [Behrends (2017)]: Assume  $k \geq \min(m, n)$ , then the following statements are equivalent:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1. \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \exists X _ {\epsilon} \text {s u c h t h a t} X _ {\epsilon} Y = 0 \text {a n d} X + X _ {\epsilon} \text {i s f u l l r o w r a n k .} \\ \text {o r} \\ \exists Y _ {\epsilon} \text {s u c h t h a t} X Y _ {\epsilon} = 0 \text {a n d} Y + Y _ {\epsilon} \text {i s f u l l c o l u m n r a n k .} \end{array} \right. \\ 2. d i m \left(\mathcal {N} (X) \cap \mathcal {C} (Y)\right) \leq k - m o r n - \left(r a n k (Y) - d i m \left(\mathcal {N} (X) \cap \mathcal {C} (Y)\right)\right) \leq k - r a n k (X). \\ 3. \mathcal {M} (X, Y) i s \text {l o c a l l o p e n a t} (X, Y). \\ \end{array}
$$

The above proposition provides a checkable condition which completely characterizes the local openness of the mapping  $\mathcal{M}$  at different points when the range of the mapping is the entire space. Now, let us state our result that characterizes the local openness of the mapping  $\mathcal{M}$  in its range when  $k < \min\{m, n\}$ .

Theorem 3. Let  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}$ ,  $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$ , and  $k < \min(m, n)$ . Then if  $\text{rank}(X) \neq \text{rank}(Y)$ ,  $\mathcal{M}(X, Y)$  is not locally open at  $(X, Y)$ . Else if  $\text{rank}(X) = \text{rank}(Y)$ , then the following statements are equivalent:

$$
i) \left\{ \begin{array}{l} (\mathcal {A} _ {X}): \exists X _ {\epsilon} \text {s u c h t h a t} X _ {\epsilon} Y = 0 \text {a n d} X + X _ {\epsilon} \text {i s f u l l c o l u m n r a n k}. \\ \hskip 1 4. 2 2 6 3 7 8 p t \text {a n d} \\ (\mathcal {A} _ {Y}): \exists Y _ {\epsilon} \text {s u c h t h a t} X Y _ {\epsilon} = 0 \text {a n d} Y + Y _ {\epsilon} \text {i s f u l l r o w r a n k}. \end{array} \right.
$$

ii)  $dim\bigl (\mathcal{N}(X)\cap \mathcal{C}(Y)\bigr) = 0\Leftrightarrow dim\bigl (\mathcal{N}(Y^T)\cap \mathcal{C}(X^T)\bigr) = 0.$  
iii)  $Z = \mathcal{M}(X,Y)$  is locally open at  $(X,Y)$  in  $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{M}}^u$

As previously mentioned, local openness can be described in terms of perturbation analysis. For example,  $\mathcal{M}(X,Y)$  is locally open at  $(X,Y)$  if for a given  $\epsilon >0$ , there exists  $\delta >0$  such that for any  $\tilde{Z} = Z + R_{\delta}\in \mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{M}}^{u}$  with  $||R_{\delta}||\leq \delta$ , there exists  $X_0,Y_0$  with  $||X_0||\leq \epsilon$ ,  $||Y_0||\leq \epsilon$ , such that  $\tilde{Z} = (X + X_0)(Y + Y_0)$ . As a perturbation bound on  $\delta$ , we show that for any locally open pair  $(X,Y)$ , given an  $\epsilon$ , we need to choose  $\delta$  to be of order  $\epsilon$ . The details of our analysis can be found in the proof of Theorem 3 in Appendix A.2.

Remark 1 It follows from Theorem 3 that when  $X$  is full column rank, and  $Y$  is full row rank, the mapping  $\mathcal{M}(X,Y)$  is locally open at  $(X,Y)$ . This result was observed in other works; see, e.g., (Sun, 2015, Proposition 4.2). Also when  $k < \min(m,n)$  if only one of the two matrices is full rank, then the mapping is not locally open. We have showed this result in the proof of Theorem 3, and below is a simple example:

Let

$$
X _ {1} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right], \quad Y _ {1} = [ 0, 0 ], \quad X _ {1} Y _ {1} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right], \quad R _ {\delta} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} \delta & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right],
$$

then  $X_{1}Y_{1} + R_{\delta}$  is feasible. On the other hand, for a perturbation  $X_{1}^{\epsilon} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}\epsilon_{1}\\ \epsilon_{2} \end{array} \right]$  and  $Y_{1}^{\epsilon} = [\epsilon_{3},\epsilon_{4}]$ , we have

$$
(X _ {1} + X _ {1} ^ {\epsilon}) (Y _ {1} + Y _ {1} ^ {\epsilon}) = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} (1 + \epsilon_ {1}) \epsilon_ {3} & (1 + \epsilon_ {1}) \epsilon_ {4} \\ (1 + \epsilon_ {2}) \epsilon_ {3} & (1 + \epsilon_ {2}) \epsilon_ {4} \end{array} \right].
$$

Hence, in order for this perturbation to be equal to  $X_{1}Y_{1} + R_{\delta}$ , we need  $\epsilon_3$  to be different from zero. However, when  $\epsilon_3$  is different from zero, for small enough  $\epsilon_2$ , there does not exist such an  $X_{1}^{\epsilon}, Y_{1}^{\epsilon}$  or equivalently,  $\mathcal{M}(X_1,Y_1)$  is not locally open at  $(X_{1},Y_{1})$ . Similarly,  $X_{2} = Y_{1}^{T}$  and  $Y_{2} = X_{1}^{T}$  constitutes an example of a rank deficient  $X$  and full rank  $Y$  for which  $\mathcal{M}(X,Y)$  is not locally open.

In the next sections, we use our local openness result to characterize the cases where the local optima of various training optimization problems of the form (6) are globally optimal.

# 4 NON-LINEAR DEEP NEURAL NETWORK WITH A PYRAMIDAL STRUCTURE:

Consider the non-linear deep neural network optimization problem with a pyramidal structure

$$
\underset {W} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \ell \left(\mathcal {F} _ {h} (W)\right) \quad \text {w i t h} \quad \mathcal {F} _ {1} (W) \triangleq \sigma_ {1} \left(W _ {1} X\right); \quad \mathcal {F} _ {k} (W) \triangleq \sigma_ {k} \left(W _ {k} \mathcal {F} _ {k - 1} (W)\right), \tag {9}

for  $k \in [2, h]$ , where  $\sigma_k(\cdot)$  is the activation function applied component-wise, i.e.,  $\sigma_k(B) = [\sigma_k(B_{ij})]_{i,j}$  with  $\sigma_k : \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ . Here  $W = (W_i)_{i=1}^h$  where  $W_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i \times d_{i-1}}$  is the weight matrix of layer  $i$ , and  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0 \times n}$  is the input training data. In this section, we consider the pyramidal network structure with  $d_0 > n$  and  $d_i \leq d_{i-1}$  for  $1 \leq i \leq h$ ; see Nguyen & Hein (2017).

First notice that when  $X$  is full column rank, the image of the mapping  $\mathcal{F}_h$  is in fact the entire space  $\mathbb{R}^{d_h\times n}$  and hence every local optima of the auxiliary optimization problem (7) is global. We now show that when  $W_{i}$ 's are all full row rank and  $\sigma (\cdot)$  is invertible, the mapping  $\mathcal{F}_h$  is locally open at  $W$ .

Lemma 4. Assume the functions  $\sigma_k(\cdot):\mathbb{R}\mapsto \mathbb{R}$  are invertible. Then the mapping  $\mathcal{F}_h$  defined in (9) is locally open at the point  $W = (W_{1},\dots ,W_{h})$  if  $W_{i}$ 's are all full row rank.

Before proving this result, we would like to remark that many of the popular activation functions such as logistic, tangent hyperbolic, and leaky ReLu are invertible and satisfy the assumptions of this lemma.

Proof. Let us prove by induction. Since linear mappings are open, and since  $\sigma_1(\cdot)$  is invertible; by using the composition property of open maps, we get that  $\mathcal{F}_1$  is open.

Assume  $\mathcal{F}_{k-1}\left(\left(W_i\right)_{i=1}^{k-1}\right)$  is locally open at  $\left(W_i\right)_{i=1}^{k-1}$ , then using Proposition 2, due to the full row rankness of  $W_k$ , the mapping  $W_k\mathcal{F}_{k-1}\left(\left(W_i\right)_{i=1}^{k-1}\right)$  is locally open at  $\left(W_k, \left(W_i\right)_{i=1}^{k-1}\right)$ . Using the composition property of open maps and invertibility of  $\sigma_k(\cdot)$ , we get  $\mathcal{F}_k\left(\left(W_i\right)_{i=1}^k\right)$  is locally open at  $\left(W_i\right)_{i=1}^k$ .

Thus, by Observation 1, if  $W$  is a local optimum of problem (9) with  $W_{i}$ 's being full row rank, then  $Z = \mathcal{F}_h(W)$  is a local optimum of the corresponding auxiliary problem:

$$
\underset {Z \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {h} \times n}} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \ell (Z)
$$

and is consequently a global optimum of problem (9) when the loss function  $\ell(\cdot)$  is convex. Nguyen & Hein (2017) show that every critical point  $W$  of problem (9) with  $W_{i}$ 's being full row rank is a global optimum when both  $\sigma(\cdot)$  and  $\ell(\cdot)$  are differentiable. Our result relaxes the differentiability assumption on both the activation and loss functions; however, we can only show all local optima are global.

# 5 TWO-LAYER LINEAR NEURAL NETWORK

Consider the two layer linear neural network optimization problem

$$
\underset {W} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \frac {1}{2} \| W _ {2} W _ {1} X - Y \| _ {F} ^ {2} \tag {10}
$$

where  $W_{2} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{2} \times d_{1}}$  and  $W_{1} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{1} \times d_{0}}$  are weight matrices,  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{0} \times n}$  is the input data, and  $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{2} \times n}$  is the target training data. Using our transformation, the corresponding auxiliary optimization problem can be written as

$$
\underset {Z} {\operatorname * {m i n i m u m}} \quad \frac {1}{2} | | Z X - Y | | _ {F} ^ {2} \tag {11}
$$

subject to  $\operatorname{rank}(Z) \leq \min(d_2, d_1, d_0)$

(Kawaguchi, 2016, Theorem 2.3) shows that when  $XX^T$  and  $YX^T$  are full rank,  $d_2 \leq d_0$ , and when  $YX^T (XX^T)^{-1} XY^T$  has  $d_2$  distinct eigenvalues, every local optimum is global and all saddle points are second order saddles. While the local/global equivalence result holds for deeper networks, the property that all saddles are second order does not hold in that case. Another related result by (Yun et al., 2017, Theorem 2.2) shows that when  $XX^T$ ,  $YX^T$ , and  $YX^T (XX^T)^{-1} XY^T$  are full rank, every local optimum of a linear deep network is global. Moreover, they provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a critical point to be a global minimum. However, we notice that the full rankness assumption on  $YX^T$  was not used in showing the result for non-degenerate critical points and thus can be relaxed in that case. In this section, without any assumption on  $Y$ , we reconstruct the proof that shows the latter result for 2-layer networks using local openness, and then show a similar result for the degenerate case. The result for the degenerate case hold when replacing the square loss error by a general convex loss function as we will see in Colorollary 6. The proofs of the theorem and corollary stated below can be found in Appendix A.1

Theorem 5. Every degenerate critical point of problem (10) is either a global minimum or a second order saddle. If  $X$  is full row rank, then every non-degenerate critical point of problem (10) is either a global minimum or a saddle point.

Corollary 6. Let the square loss error in (10) be replaced by a general convex loss function  $\ell(\cdot)$ . Then every degenerate critical point is either a global minimum or a second order saddle.

Baldi & Hornik (1989) and Srebro & Jaakkola (2003) show the same result when both  $X$  and  $Y$  are full row rank. Theorem 5 generalizes their results by relaxing the assumptions on  $Y$ . Another implication of this theorem is the problem of the fully observed non-symmetric matrix completion. Ge et al. (2016) studied the symmetric matrix completion problem and showed that every local minimum is global (but not the non-symmetric case). By setting  $X = I$ , the theorem above extends the results in Ge et al. (2016) to the non-symmetric case. We summarize our results in the following chart:

# 6 MULTI-LAYER DEEP LINEAR NEURAL NETWORK

Consider the training problem of multi-layer deep linear neural networks:

$$
\underset {W} {\text {m i n i m i z e}} \frac {1}{2} \| W _ {h} \dots W _ {1} X - Y \| _ {F} ^ {2}. \tag {12}
$$

Here  $W = \left(W_{i}\right)_{i = 1}^{h}$ ,  $W_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i} \times d_{i - 1}}$  are the weight matrices,  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d_0 \times n}$  is the input training data, and  $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h \times n}$  is the target training data. Based on our general framework, the corresponding auxiliary optimization problem is given by

$$
\underset {Z \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {h} \times n}} {\text {m i n i m u m}} \frac {1}{2} | | Z X - Y | | _ {F} ^ {2} \tag {13}
$$

$$
\text {s u b j e c t} \quad \operatorname {r a n k} (Z) \leq d _ {p} \triangleq \min  _ {0 \leq i \leq h} d _ {i}
$$

Lu & Kawaguchi (2017) attempted to prove that when  $X$  and  $Y$  are full row rank, every local minimum is global. However, the derivation does not constitute a formal proof of the desired result; this is because it uses Lemma 3.3 which states that given a full rank matrix  $\bar{M}$  with singular value decomposition (SVD)  $\bar{M} = \bar{U}\bar{\Sigma}\bar{V}^T$ , for any perturbation  $M$  of  $\bar{M}$ , there exists  $U, \Sigma$ , and  $V$  perturbations of  $\bar{U}, \bar{\Sigma}$ , and  $\bar{V}$  respectively, such that  $U\Sigma V^T = M$  is an SVD in  $M$ . This statement is not true in general due to the following counterexample provided by Stewart (1998):

Let

$$
\bar {M} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 + \epsilon \end{array} \right] \quad \text {a n d} \quad M = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & \epsilon \\ \epsilon & 1 \end{array} \right].
$$

Then the right singular vectors of  $\bar{M}$  are given by

$$
\bar {V} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right],
$$

while the right singular vectors of  $M$  are given by

$$
V = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} \left[ \begin{array}{l l} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & - 1 \end{array} \right].
$$

However, this Lemma was only used to prove (Lu & Kawaguchi, 2017, Theorem 3.1) which, as we will show next, can be derived using Proposition 2 and Theorem 3. Before proceeding to the proof we define the following mapping:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {M} _ {i, j} \left(W _ {i}, \dots , W _ {j}\right): \left\{W _ {i}, \dots , W _ {j} \right\}\rightarrow \mathcal {R} _ {\mathcal {M} _ {i, j}} \triangleq \left\{Z \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d _ {i} \times d _ {j - 1}} \mid \operatorname {r a n k} (Z) \leq \min  _ {j - 1 \leq l \leq i} d _ {l} \right\} \\ \text {w i t h} \quad \mathcal {M} _ {i, j} \left(W _ {i}, \dots , W _ {j}\right) = W _ {i} \dots W _ {j} \quad \text {f o r} i > j \\ \end{array}
$$

Now let  $Z = W_{h}W_{h - 1}\ldots W_{1} = \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{M}_{h,p + 1},\mathcal{M}_{p,1})$  be a rank  $d_p$  matrix, we state Theorem 3.1 of Lu & Kawaguchi (2017) using our notation.

Lemma 7. If  $W$  is non-degenerate, then  $\mathcal{M}_{h,1}(W) = W_h \cdots W_1$  is locally open at  $W$ .

Proof. We construct a proof by induction on  $h$  to show the desired result. When  $h = 2$ , we either have  $d_{1} < \min(d_{2}, d_{0})$  or  $d_{1} \geq \min(d_{2}, d_{0})$ . In the first case, since

$$
d _ {1} = \operatorname {r a n k} (\bar {W} _ {2} \bar {W} _ {1}) \leq \operatorname {r a n k} (\bar {W} _ {1}) \leq d _ {1}, \quad \text {a n d} \quad d _ {1} = \operatorname {r a n k} (\bar {W} _ {2} \bar {W} _ {1}) \leq \operatorname {r a n k} (\bar {W} _ {2}) \leq d _ {1},
$$

then by Theorem 3, we get  $\mathcal{M}_{2,1}$  is locally open at  $(W_{2},W_{1})$ . In the second case, and since either

$$
d _ {2} = \operatorname {r a n k} (\bar {W} _ {2} \bar {W} _ {1}) \leq \operatorname {r a n k} (\bar {W} _ {2}) \leq d _ {2}, \quad \text {o r} \quad d _ {0} = \operatorname {r a n k} (\bar {W} _ {2} \bar {W} _ {1}) \leq \operatorname {r a n k} (\bar {W} _ {1}) \leq d _ {0},
$$

then by Proposition 2,  $\mathcal{M}_{2,1}$  is locally open at  $(W_{2},W_{1})$

Now assume the result holds for the product of  $h$  matrices  $\mathcal{M}_{h,1}(W)$ , we show it is true for  $\mathcal{M}_{h+1,1}(W)$ .

Since

$$
d _ {p} = \operatorname {r a n k} \left(\bar {W} _ {h}, \dots , \bar {W} _ {1}\right) \leq \operatorname {r a n k} \left(W _ {p + 1} W _ {p}\right) \leq d _ {p}
$$

then using Proposition 2, we get  $\mathcal{M}_{p + 1,p}$  is locally open at  $(W_{p + 1},W_p)$ . So we can replace  $W_{p + 1}W_{p}$  by a new matrix  $Z_{p}$  with rank  $d_{p}$ . Then by induction hypothesis, the product mapping  $\mathcal{M}_{h + 1,1} = W_{h + 1}\dots W_{p + 2}Z_{p}W_{p - 1}\dots W_{1}$  is locally open at  $W$ . Since the composition of locally open maps is locally open, the result follows.

We now demonstrate our main results for this optimization problem which shows that under a set of necessary conditions, every critical point of problem (12) is either a saddle or a global minimum. Although the result for the non-degenerate case directly follows from (Yun et al., 2017, Theorem 2.2), we provide in Lemma 8 a more intuitive proof that uses local openness of  $\mathcal{M}$ .

Lemma 8. Assume  $X$  is full row rank, then every non-degenerate critical point of (12) is either a saddle or a global minimum.

Proof. Suppose  $W = (W_{h}, \dots, W_{1})$  is a non-degenerate local minimum. Then it follows by Lemma 7 that  $\mathcal{M}_{h,1}$  is locally open at  $W$ . Then by Lemma 1,  $Z = \mathcal{M}_h(W_h, \dots, W_1)$  is a local optimum of problem (13) which is in fact global by (Lu & Kawaguchi, 2017, Theorem 2.2).
