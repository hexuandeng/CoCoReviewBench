# ABSTRACT

We study data-driven methods for community detection on graphs, an inverse problem that is typically solved in terms of the spectrum of certain operators or via posterior inference under certain probabilistic graphical models. Focusing on random graph families such as the stochastic block model, recent research has unified both approaches and identified both statistical and computational signal-to-noise detection thresholds.

This graph inference task can be recast as a node-wise graph classification problem, and, as such, computational detection thresholds can be translated in terms of learning within appropriate models. We present a novel family of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and show that they can reach those detection thresholds in a purely data-driven manner without access to the underlying generative models, and even improve upon current computational thresholds in hard regimes. For that purpose, we propose to augment GNNs with the non-backtracking operator, defined on the line graph of edge adjacencies. We also perform the first analysis of optimization landscape on using GNNs to solve community detection problems, demonstrating that under certain simplifications and assumptions, the loss value at the local minima is close to the loss value at the global minimum/minima. Finally, the resulting model is also tested on real datasets, performing significantly better than previous models.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Graph inference problems encompass a large class of tasks and domains, from posterior inference in probabilistic graphical models to community detection and ranking in generic networks, image segmentation, or graph inverse problems. They are motivated both by practical applications, such as PageRank, but also by fundamental complexity questions, which ask for the intrinsic algorithmic hardness of solving a certain class of graph inference tasks.

These problems can be formulated in either unsupervised, semi-supervised or purely supervised learning settings. In the latter, one assumes a dataset of graphs with labels on its nodes and/or edges, and attempts to perform node/edge classification by optimizing a loss over a certain parametric class, e.g. neural networks. Graph Neural Networks ((Gori et al., 2005), (Bronstein et al., 2017) and references therein) are natural extensions of Convolutional Neural Networks to graph-structured data, and have emerged as a powerful class of algorithms to perform complex graph inference leveraging labeled data. In essence, these neural networks learn cascaded linear combinations of intrinsic graph operators interleaved with node-wise (or edge-wise) activation functions. Since they learn from intrinsic graph operators, they can be applied to varying input graphs, and they offer the same parameter sharing advantages as their CNN counterparts.

In this work, we focus on community detection problems, a wide class of node classification tasks that attempt to discover a clustered, segmented structure within a graph. The algorithmic approaches to this problem include a rich class of spectral methods, which take advantage of the spectrum of certain operators defined on the graph, as well as approximate message-passing methods such as belief propagation (BP), which performs approximate posterior inference under predefined graphical models. Focusing on the supervised setting, we study the ability of GNNs to approximate, generalize or even improve upon these class of algorithms. Our motivation is two-fold. On the one hand, this problem exhibits algorithmic hardness on some settings, opening up the possibility to discover more

efficient algorithms than the current ones. On the other hand, many practical scenarios fall beyond pre-specified probabilistic models, requiring data-driven solutions.

We propose key modifications to the GNN architecture allowing it to exploit edge adjacency information through the non-backtracking operator of the graph. This operator is defined over the edges of the graph and allows a directed flow of information even when the original graph is undirected. We refer to the resulting model as a Line Graph Neural Network (LGNN). Focusing on important random graph families exhibiting community structure, such as the stochastic block model and the geometric block model, we demonstrate improvements in the performance by LGNN, even in regimes within the so-called computational-to-statistical gap. A perhaps surprising aspect is that these gains can be obtained even with linear GNNs, which become parametric versions of power iteration algorithms.

This motivates our second main contribution: the analysis of the optimization landscape of such linear GNN models when trained with planted solutions of a given graph distribution. We show that under reparametrization, these landscapes have an interesting property, namely the presence of an energy gap controlling the energy difference between local and global minima. With certain assumptions on the spectral concentration of certain random matrices, this energy gap shrinks as the size of the input graphs increases, which would mean that the optimization landscape is benign on large enough graphs.

# Summary of Main Contributions:

- We propose an extension of GNNs that operate on the line graph using the non-backtracking operator, which yields significant improvements on hard community detection regimes.  
- We show that on the stochastic block model we reach detection thresholds in a purely data-driven fashion and improve upon belief-propagation in hard SBM detection regimes, as well as in the geometric block model.  
- We perform the first analysis of the learning landscape of GNN models, showing that under certain simplifications and assumptions, they exhibit a form of "energy gap", where local minima are confined in low-energy configurations.  
- We show how our model can be applied to real-world datasets, leading to state-of-the-art community detection results.

# 2 PROBLEM SETUP

We are interested in a specific class of node-classification tasks in which given an input graph  $G = (V, E)$ , a signal  $y: V \to \{1, C\}$  encoding a partition of  $V$  into  $C$  groups is to be predicted at each node. We assume that a training set  $\{(G_t, y_t)\}_{t \leq T}$  is given, which we use to learn a model  $\hat{y} = \Phi(G, \theta)$  trained by minimising

$$
{ } ^ { \mathrm { g } } L ( \theta ) = \frac { 1 } { T } \sum _ { t \leq T } \ell \left( \Phi \left( G _ { t } , \theta \right) , y _ { t } \right) .
$$

Since  $y$  encodes a partition of  $C$  groups, the specific label of each node is only important up to a global permutation of  $\{1,C\}$ . Section 4.3 describes how to construct losses  $\ell(a,b)$  with such a property. A permutation of the observed nodes translates into the same permutation applied to the labels, which justifies models  $\Phi$  that are equivariant to permutations. Also, we are interested in inferring properties of community detection algorithms that do not depend on the specific size of the graphs<sup>1</sup>. We therefore require that the model  $\Phi$  accepts graphs of variable size for the same set of parameters, similarly as in sequential RNN or spatial CNN models. In our study of random graph models (SBM and GBM), we construct a training set of planted solutions. Labels  $y_{i}$  are generated by sampling a balanced partition uniformly at random, and then we produce the input graphs  $G_{i}$  by sampling  $G_{i}|y_{i}$  according to each random graph model.

# 3 RELATED WORK

GNN was first proposed in Gori et al. (2005); Scarselli et al. (2009). Bruna et al. (2013) generalized convolutional neural networks on general undirected graphs by using the graph Laplacian's eigenbasis.

This was the first time the Laplacian operator was used in a neural network architecture to perform classification on graph inputs. Defferrard et al. (2016) considers a symmetric Laplacian generator to define a multiscale GNN architecture, demonstrated on classification tasks. Similarly, Kipf & Welling (2016) uses a similar generator as effective embedding mechanisms for graph signals and applies it to semi-supervised tasks. This is the closest application of GNNs to our current contribution. However, we highlight that semi-supervised learning requires bootstrapping the estimation with a subset of labeled nodes, and is mainly interested in generalization within a single, fixed graph. In comparison, our setup considers community detection across a distribution of input graphs and assumes no initial labeling on a given test-set input graph.

There have been several extensions of GNNs (Li et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2016; Duvenaud et al., 2015; Niepert et al., 2016) by modifying their non-linear activation functions, their parameter sharing strategies, and their choice of graph operators. In particular, Gilmer et al. (2017) interpreted the GNN architecture as learning an approximate message-passing algorithm, which extends the learning of hidden representations to graph edges in addition to graph nodes. Recently, Velickovic et al. (2017) relates adjacency learning with attention mechanisms, and Vaswani et al. (2017) proposes a similar architecture in the context of machine translation. Another recent and related piece of work is Kondor et al. (2018), which proposes a generalization of GNN that captures high-order node interactions through covariant tensor algebra. Our approach to extend the expressive power of GNN using the line graph may be seen as an alternative to capture such high-order interactions.

Our energy landscape analysis is related to the recent paper (Shamir, 2018), which establishes an energy bound on the local minima arising in the optimization of ResNets. In our case, we exploit the properties of the community detection problem to produce an energy bound that depends on the concentration certain random matrices, which one may hope for as the size of the input graphs increases. Finally, Zhang (2016)'s work on data regularization for clustering and rank estimation is also motivated by the success of using Bethe-Hessian-like perturbations to improve spectral methods on sparse networks. It finds good perturbations via matrix perturbations, and also has success on the stochastic block model. Yang & Leskovec (2012a) curates benchmark datasets for community detection and quantifies the quality of these datasets, while Yang & Leskovec (2012b) develops new algorithms for community detection by fitting data to newly designed generative models, which exhibit similar statistical structure learned from their analysis of the aforementioned datasets.

Figure 1. Overview of the architecture of our LGNN. Given an input graph  $G$ , we construct its line graph  $L(G)$  using the non-backtracking operator (see Figure 2) and we propagate the degree signal through multiple layers of graph diffusion in  $G$  and  $L(G)$ ; see equations (1) and (2). The output node features are used to predict node-wise labels, and the whole network is trained end-to-end using standard backpropagation using a label permutation invariant loss (see Section 4.3). The trained model can then be used to infer communities on input graphs of arbitrary size and connectivity.

This section introduces our GNN architectures based on the power graph adjacency (Section 4.1) and its extension to line graphs using the non-backtracking operator (Section 4.2), as well as the design of losses invariant to global label permutations (Section 4.3).

# 4.1 POWER GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS

The Graph Neural Network (GNN), introduced in (Scarselli et al., 2009) and later simplified in (GGS; Duvenaud et al., 2015; com) is a flexible neural network architecture that is based on local operators on a graph  $G = (V, E)$ . We start by briefly reviewing the generic GNN architecture, and next describe our modifications to make it suitable to our interests. Given some input signal  $x \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times b}$  on the vertices of  $G$ , we consider graph intrinsic linear operators that act locally on this signal: The degree operator is the linear map  $D: F \mapsto DF$  where  $(Dx)_i \coloneqq deg(i) \cdot x_i$ ,  $D(x) = \mathrm{diag}(A1)x$ . The adjacency operator  $A$  is the linear map given by the adjacency matrix  $A_{i,j} = 1$  iff  $(i,j) \in E$ . In this way,  $J$ -th powers of  $A$  encode  $J$ -hop neighborhoods of each node, and allow us to combine and aggregate local information at different scales. We consider in this work the power graph adjacency  $A_j = \min(1, A^{2^j})$ , which encodes  $2^j$ -hop neighborhoods into a binary graph.

We consider a multiscale GNN layer that receives as input a signal  $x^{(k)} \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times b_k}$  and produces  $x^{(k+1)} \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times b_{k+1}}$  as

$$
x ^ {(k + 1)} _ {i, l} = \rho \left[ x _ {i} ^ {(k)} \theta_ {1, l} ^ {(k)} + (D x ^ {(k)}) _ {i} \theta_ {2, l} ^ {(k)} + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {J - 1} (A ^ {2 ^ {j}} x ^ {(k)}) _ {i} \theta_ {3 + j, l} ^ {(k)} \right], l = 1, \dots b _ {k + 1} / 2, i \in V, (1)
$$

$$
x ^ {(k + 1)} _ {i, l} = x _ {i} ^ {(k)} \theta_ {1, l} ^ {(k)} + (D x ^ {(k)}) _ {i} \theta_ {2, l} ^ {(k)} + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {J - 1} (A ^ {2 ^ {j}} x ^ {(k)}) _ {i} \theta_ {3 + j, l} ^ {(k)}, l = b _ {k + 1} / 2 + 1, \ldots b _ {k + 1}, i \in V,
$$

where  $\Theta = \{\theta_{1}^{(k)},\dots,\theta_{J + 3}^{(k)}\}$ ,  $\theta_s^{(k)}\in \mathbb{R}^{b_k\times b_{k + 1}}$  are trainable parameters and  $\rho (\cdot)$  is a point-wise nonlinearity, chosen in this work to be  $\rho (z) = \max (0,z)$ . We thus consider a layer with linear "residual connections" (He et al., 2016), both to ease with the optimization when using large number of layers and to give the model the ability to perform power iterations. Since the spectral radius of the learned linear operators in (1) can grow as the optimization progresses, the cascade of GNN layers can become unstable to training. In order to mitigate this effect, we consider spatial batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) at each layer.

As explained in Section B.1, the Krylov subspace generated by the graph Laplacian (Defferrard et al., 2016) is not sufficient in this case to operate well in the sparse regime, as opposed to the generators  $\{I, D, A\}$ . The expressive power of each layer is increased by adding multiscale versions of  $A$ , although this benefit comes at the cost of computational efficiency, especially in the sparse regime. The network depth is chosen to be of the order of the graph diameter, so that all nodes obtain information from the entire graph. In sparse graphs with small diameter, this architecture offers excellent scalability and computational complexity. Indeed, in many social networks diameters are constant (due to hubs), or  $\sim \log(|V|)$ , as in the stochastic block model in the constant average degree regime (Riordan & Wormald, 2010). This results in a model with computational complexity of the order of  $\sim |V| \log(|V|)$ , making it amenable to large-scale graphs. In our setup, batch normalization not only prevents gradient blowup, but also performs the orthogonalisation relative to the constant vector, which is associated with the smallest eigenvector of the graph operator whose spectrum contains community information. This reinforces the analogy between cascading layers of (1) and the power iterations to obtain the Fiedler vector of such operator. Indeed, if one wants to extract the Fiedler vector of a matrix  $M$ , whose smallest eigenvector is known to be  $v$ , one can do so by performing power iterations on  $\tilde{M} = \| M \| I - M$  as  $y^{(n+1)} = \tilde{M} x^{(n)}$ ,  $x^{(n+1)} = \frac{y^{(n+1)} - v^T v y^{(n+1)}}{\| y^{(n+1)} - v^T v y^{(n+1)} \|}$ . If  $v$  is a constant vector, then the normalization above is precisely performed within the batch normalization step.

# 4.2 LGNN: POWER GNN ON LINE GRAPHS WITH NON-BACKTRACKING OPERATOR

For graphs that have few cycles, posterior inference can be remarkably approximated by loopy belief propagation (Yedidia et al., 2003). As described in Section B.2, the message-passing rules are defined over the edge adjacency graph; see equation 57. Although its second-order approximation

around the critical point can be efficiently approximated with a power method over the original graph, a data-driven version of BP requires accounting for the non-backtracking structure of the message-passing. In this section we describe how to upgrade the GNN model so that it can exploit non-backtracking operators.

The line graph  $L(G) = (V_L, E_L)$  is the graph representing the edge adjacency structure of  $G$ . If  $G = (V, E)$  is an undirected graph, then the vertices  $V_L$  of  $L(G)$  are the ordered edges in  $E$ , that is  $V_L = \{(i \to j); (i, j) \in E\} \cup \{(j \to i); (i, j) \in E\}$ , so  $|V_L| = 2|E|$ . The nonbacktracking operator  $B \in \mathbb{R}^{2|E| \times 2|E|}$  encodes the edge adjacency structure as follows. Two nodes in  $L(G)$  are connected if

$$
B _ {(i \to j), (i ^ {\prime} \to j ^ {\prime})} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1 & \text {i f} j = i ^ {\prime} \text {a n d} j ^ {\prime} \neq i  , \\ 0 & \text {o t h e r w i s e .} \end{array} \right.
$$

This operator thus enables the propagation of directed information through the graph. The message-passing rules of BP can be expressed as a diffusion in the line graph  $L(G)$  using this non-backtracking operator, with specific choices of activation function that turn product of beliefs into sums.

A natural extension of the GNN architecture presented in Section 4.1 is thus to consider a second GNN defined on  $L(G)$ , generated by the corresponding non-backtracking operator  $B$  and degree  $D_B = \mathrm{diag}(B\mathbf{1})$  operators. This

effectively defines edge features that are diffused and updated according to the edge adjacency of  $G$ . Edge and node features are combined at each layer using the edge indicator matrices  $\mathrm{Pm}$ ,  $\mathrm{Pd} \in \{0,1\}^{|V|\times 2|E|}$ , defined as  $\mathrm{Pm}_{i,(i\rightarrow j)} = 1$ ,  $\mathrm{Pm}_{j,(i\rightarrow j)} = 1$ ,  $\mathrm{Pd}_{i,(i\rightarrow j)} = 1$ ,  $\mathrm{Pd}_{j,(i\rightarrow j)} = -1$  and 0 otherwise. Dropping the skip linear connections for ease of exposition, the resulting model becomes

$$
x ^ {(k + 1)} _ {i, l} = \rho \left[ x _ {i} ^ {(k)} \theta_ {1, l} ^ {(k)} + (D x ^ {(k)}) _ {i} \theta_ {2, l} ^ {(k)} + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {J - 1} \left(A ^ {2 ^ {j}} x ^ {(k)}\right) _ {i} \theta_ {3 + j, l} ^ {(k)} + \left\{\mathrm {P m}, \mathrm {P d} \right\} y ^ {(k)} \theta_ {3 + J, l} ^ {(k)} \right], i \in V \tag {2}
$$

$$
y ^ {(k + 1)} _ {i ^ {\prime}, l ^ {\prime}} = \rho \left[ y _ {i ^ {\prime}} ^ {(k)} \gamma_ {1, l ^ {\prime}} ^ {(k)} + (D _ {L (G)} y ^ {(k)}) _ {i ^ {\prime}} \gamma_ {2, l ^ {\prime}} ^ {(k)} + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {J - 1} (A _ {L (G)} ^ {2 j} y ^ {(k)}) _ {i ^ {\prime}} \gamma_ {3 + j, l ^ {\prime}} ^ {(k)} + [ \{\mathrm {P m , P d} \} ^ {\top} x ^ {(k + 1)} ] _ {i ^ {\prime}} \gamma_ {3 + J, l ^ {\prime}} ^ {(k)} \right], i ^ {\prime} \in V _ {L}.
$$

with additional parameters  $\{\gamma_1^{(k)},\ldots ,\gamma_{J + 3}^{(k)}\}$ $\gamma_s^{(k)}\in \mathbb{R}^{b_k\times b_{k + 1}}$  . The resulting architecture is named as a Line Graph Neural Network (LGNN).

It can be verified that the resulting model  $\Phi (G)\coloneqq x^{(K)}$  satisfies the permutation equivariance property required for the task:  $\Phi (G_{\pi}) = \Pi \Phi (G)$ , where  $\Pi$  is the permutation matrix associated with  $\pi$ . Several authors have proposed combining node and edge feature learning (Gori et al., 2005; Gilmer et al., 2017; Velickovic et al., 2017), although we are not aware of works that considered the edge adjacency structure provided by the line graph and the non-backtracking operator. For graph families with constant average degree  $\overline{d}$ , the line graph has size  $2|E| = \overline{d} |V|$  of the same order, making this model feasible from the computational point of view. The line graph construction can be iterated with  $L(L(G)), L(\dots L(L(G))\dots)$  to yield a graph hierarchy, which would capture high-order interactions between the elements of  $G$ . Such hierarchical construction relates to other recent efforts to generalize GNNs (Kondor et al., 2018). In our experiments, we use the input signals  $x^{(0)} = \deg (G)$  and  $y^{(0)} = \deg (L(G))$  in the line graph version.

Relationship between LGNN and edge feature learning approaches: The GNN on the line graph using the non-backtracking operator can be interpreted as learning directed edge features from an undirected graph. Indeed, if each node  $i$  contains two distinct sets of features  $x_{s}(i)$  and  $x_{r}(i)$ , the non-backtracking operator constructs edge features from node features while preserving orientation: For an edge  $e = (i,j)$ , our model constructs oriented edge features  $f_{i\rightarrow j} = g(x_s(i),x_r(j))$  and

$f_{j\rightarrow i} = g(x_r(i),x_s(j))$  (where  $g$  is trainable and not necessarily commutative on its arguments) that are subsequently propagated through the graph. Constructing such local oriented structure is shown to significantly improve performance in the next section. (Battaglia et al., 2016) introduced edge features over directed and typed graphs, but does not discuss the undirected case. (Kearnes et al., 2016; Gilmer et al., 2017) learn edge features on undirected graphs using  $f_{e} = g(x(i),x(j))$  for an edge  $e = (i,j)$ , where  $g$  is now commutative on its arguments. Finally, (Velickovic et al., 2017) learns directed edge features on undirected graphs using stochastic matrices as adjacencies (which are either row or column-normalized).

# 4.3 A LOSS FUNCTION INVARIANT UNER LABEL PERMUTATION

Let  $\mathcal{C} = \{c_1, \ldots, c_C\}$  denote the possible community labelings that each node can take. Consider first the case where communities do not overlap:  $C$  equals the number of existing communities. We define the network output at each node using standard softmax, computing the conditional probability that node  $i$  belongs to community  $c$ :  $o_{i,c} = p(y_i = c | \theta, G)$ . Let  $y \in \mathcal{C}^{\tilde{V}}$  be the ground truth community structure. Since community belonging is defined up to global label changes in communities, we define the loss associated with a given graph instance as

$$
\ell (\theta) = \inf  _ {\pi \in S _ {c}} - \sum_ {i \in V} \log o _ {i, \pi \left(y _ {i}\right)} \tag {3}
$$

where  $S_{\mathcal{C}}$  denotes the permutation group of  $C$  elements. In our experiments we considered examples with small number of communities  $C \in \{2,5\}$ , but general scenarios, where  $C$  is suspected to be much larger, might make the evaluation of (3) over the permutation group of  $C$  elements impractical. A possible solution is to randomly partition for each sample  $C / \tilde{C}$  labels into  $\tilde{C}$  groups, then marginalize the model outputs  $o_{i,c}, c \leq C$  into  $\bar{o}_{i,\bar{c}} = \sum_{c \in \bar{c}} o_{i,c}$  and use  $\ell(\theta) = \inf_{\pi \in S_{\tilde{c}}} - \sum_{i \in V} \log \bar{o}_{i,\pi(\bar{y}_i)}$ , which only involves a permutation group of size  $\tilde{C}!$ . Finally, if we are in a setup where nodes can belong to multiple communities, we simply redefine  $\mathcal{C}$  to include subsets of communities instead of just singletons, and modify the permutation group  $S_{\mathcal{C}}$  accordingly.

# 5 ENERGY LANDSCAPE OF LINEAR GNN OPTIMIZATION

As described in the numerical experiments, we found that the GNN models without non-linear activations already provide substantial gains relative to baseline (non-trained) algorithms, by finding suitable generalizations of power iterations. This section studies the optimization landscape resulting from this linear assumption. Despite defining a non-convex objective, we prove that the landscape is 'benign' under certain further simplifications, in the sense that the local minima are confined on sublevel sets of low energy.

For simplicity, we consider only the binary  $c = 2$  case where we replace the node-wise binary cross-entropy by the squared cosine distance $^2$ , and we assume a single feature map ( $d_k = 1$  for all  $k$ ), and focus on the power GNN described in Section 4.1 (although our analysis carries equally to describe the line graph version; see remarks below). We also make the simplifying assumption to replace the layer-wise spatial batch normalization by a simpler projection onto the unit  $\ell_2$  ball (thus we do not remove the mean). Without loss of generality, assume that the input graph  $G$  has size  $n$ , and denote by  $\mathcal{F} = \{A_1, \ldots, A_Q\}$  the family of graph operators appearing in (1). Each layer thus applies an arbitrary polynomial  $\sum_{q=1}^{Q} \theta_q^{(k)} A_q$  to the incoming node feature vector  $x^{(k)}$ . Given an input node vector  $w \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , the network output can thus be written as

$$
\hat {Y} = \frac {e}{\| e \|}, \text {w i t h} e = \left(\prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \sum_ {q \leq Q} \theta_ {q} ^ {(k)} A _ {q}\right) w. \tag {4}
$$

We highlight that this multilinear GNN setup is fundamentally different from the multilinear fully-connected neural networks whose landscape is well understood (Kawaguchi, 2016). First, the output is normalized in the sphere, which has important effects in the geometry. Next, the network parametrization is intrinsic (the operators  $O_{j}$  depend on the input), which introduces fluctuations in the

landscape that we analyze. In general, the operators in  $\mathcal{F}$  are not commutative, but by considering the generalised Krylov subspace generated by powers of  $\mathcal{F}$ ,  $\mathcal{F}^K = \{O_1 = A_1^K, O_2 = A_1A_2^{K-1}, O_3 = A_1A_2A_1^{K-2}, \ldots, O_{Q^K} = A_Q^K\}$ , one can reparametrize (4) as  $e = \sum_{j=1}^{Q^K} \beta_j O_j w$  with  $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^M$ , with  $M = Q^K$ . Given the target  $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , the loss incurred by each pair  $(G, y)$  becomes  $\frac{|\langle e, y \rangle|^2}{\|e\|^2}$ , and therefore the population loss, when expressed in terms of  $\beta$ , equals

$$
L _ {n} (\beta) = \mathbb {E} _ {X _ {n}, Y _ {n}} \frac {\beta^ {\top} Y _ {n} \beta}{\beta^ {\top} X _ {n} \beta}, \text {w i t h} \tag {5}
$$

$$
Y _ {n} = z _ {n} z _ {n} ^ {\top} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {M \times M},   (z _ {n}) _ {j} = \langle O _ {j} w, y \rangle \text {a n d} X _ {n} = U _ {n} U _ {n} ^ {\top} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {M \times M}, U _ {n} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} (O _ {1} w) ^ {\top} \\ \ldots \\ (O _ {M} w) ^ {\top} \end{array} \right].
$$

The landscape is thus specified by a pair of random matrices  $Y_{n}, X_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times M}$ . The following theorem establishes that under appropriate assumptions, the concentration of certain random matrices around their mean controls the energy gaps between local and global maxima of  $L$ .

We define a "mean-field" loss function  $\tilde{L}_n(\beta) = \mathbb{E}_{X_n,Y_n}\frac{\beta^T Y_n\beta}{\beta^T\mathbb{E}_{X_n}\beta} = \frac{\beta^T\mathbb{E}_{Y_n}\beta}{\beta^T\mathbb{E}_{X_n}\beta}$ , and consider  $L_{n}$  as a perturbation of  $\tilde{L}_n$ . Assuming that  $\mathbb{E}X_{n} > 0$ , we write the Cholesky decomposition of  $\mathbb{E}X_{n}$  as  $\mathbb{E}X_{n} = R_{n}R_{n}^{T}$ , and define  $A_{n} = R_{n}^{-1}Y_{n}(R_{n}^{-1})^{T}$ ,  $\bar{A}_n = \mathbb{E}A_n = R_n^{-1}\mathbb{E}Y_n(R_n^{-1})^T$ ,  $B_{n} = R_{n}^{-1}X_{n}(R_{n}^{-1})^{T}$ , and  $\Delta B_{n} = B_{n} - I_{n}$ . Given a symmetric matrix  $K\in \mathbb{R}^{M\times M}$ , we let  $\lambda_1(K),\lambda_2(K),\dots,\lambda_M(K)$  denote the eigenvalues of  $K$  in nondecreasing order.

Theorem 5.1. For a given  $n$ , let  $\eta_n = (\lambda_1(\bar{A}_n) - \lambda_2(\bar{A}_n))^{-1}$ ,  $\mu_n = \mathbb{E}[|\lambda_1(A_n)|^6]$ ,  $\nu_n = \mathbb{E}[|\lambda_1(B_n)|^{-6}]$ ,  $\delta_n = \mathbb{E}[||\Delta B_n||^6]$ , and assume that all four quantities are finite. Then if  $\beta_l \in \mathbb{S}^{M-1}$  is a local minimum of  $L_n$ , and  $\beta_g \in \mathbb{S}^{M-1}$  is a global minimum of  $L_n$ , we have  $L_n(\beta_l) \geq (1 - \epsilon_{\eta_n, \mu_n, \nu_n, \delta_n}) \cdot L_n(\beta_g)$ , where  $\epsilon_{\eta_n, \mu_n, \nu_n, \delta_n} = O(\delta_n)$  for given  $\eta_n, \mu_n, \nu_n$  as  $\delta_n \to 0$  and its formula is given in the appendix.

Corollary 5.2. If  $(\eta_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}^*}$ ,  $(\mu_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}^*}$ ,  $(\nu_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}^*}$  are all bounded sequences, and  $\lim_{n\to \infty}\delta_n = 0$ , then  $\forall \epsilon >0$ ,  $\exists n_{\epsilon}$  such that  $\forall n > n_{\epsilon}$ ,  $|L_{n}(\beta_{l}) - L_{n}(\beta_{g})|\leq \epsilon \cdot L_{n}(\beta_{g})$

The main strategy of the proof is to consider the actual loss function  $L_{n}$  as a perturbation of  $\tilde{L}_{n}$ , which has a landscape that is easier to analyze and does not have poor local maxima, since it is equivalent to a quadratic form defined over the sphere  $\mathbb{S}^{M - 1}$ . For a given graph inverse problem, this theorem thus requires estimating spectral fluctuations of the pair  $X_{n}, Y_{n}$ , which in turn involve the spectrum of  $C^*$  algebras generated by the non-commutative family  $\mathcal{F}$ . That said, one should expect concentration to happen in general, since the dimension  $M$  is fixed as  $n$  grows. Another interesting question is to understand how the asymptotics of our landscape analysis relate to the hardness of estimation as a function of the Signal-to-Noise ratio. Finally, another open question is to what extent our result could be extended to the non-linear residual GNN case, perhaps leveraging ideas from (Shamir, 2018).

# 6 EXPERIMENTS

We present experiments on synthetic community detection (Sections 6.1, 6.2 and Appendix C) as well as real-world detection (Section 6.3). In the synthetic experiments, our performance measure is the overlap between predicted  $(\hat{y})$  and true labels  $(y)$ , which quantifies how much better than random guessing a predicted labelling is. The overlap is given by  $\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{u}\delta_{y(u),\hat{y}(u)} - \frac{1}{C}\right) / (1 - \frac{1}{C})$  where  $\delta$  is the Kronecker delta function, and the labels are defined up to global permutation. The GNNs were all trained with 30 layers, 2 feature maps and  $J = 2$ . We used Adamax (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with learning rate 0.004 across all experiments.

# 6.1 BINARY STOCHASTIC BLOCK MODEL

The stochastic block model is a random graph model with planted community structure. In its simplest form, one assigns  $|V| = n$  nodes to  $C$  classes at random with  $y: V \to \{1, C\}$  and draws an

edge connecting any two vertices  $u, v$  independently at random with probability  $p$  if  $y(v) = y(u)$ , and with probability  $q$  otherwise. The sparse binary case  $C = 2$  when  $p, q \simeq 1/n$  is well understood and provides an initial platform to compare the GNN against provably optimal recovery algorithms; see Appendix B. We consider two learning scenarios. In the first scenario, we train parameters  $\theta$  conditional on  $p$  and  $q$ , by producing 6000 samples  $G \sim SBM(n = 1000, p_i, p_i, C = 2)$  for different pairs  $(p_i, q_i)$  and estimating the resulting  $\theta(p_i, q_i)$ . In the second scenario, reported in Appendix D, we train a single set of parameters  $\theta$  from a sample of 6000 samples containing a mixture of SBM with different parameters  $p, q$  and average degree. This setup is important as it shows our GNN is not just approximating known algorithms such as BP, since the parameters are not constant in this dataset. Figure 3 reports the performance of our models on the binary SBM model for different SNR regimes and compares it with the belief-propagation baseline from (Decelle et al., 2011), as well as the baseline spectral method using the normalized Laplacian. We observe that our models reach the statistical detection threshold, given in this case by the BP algorithm. Notice that even the linear GNN matches the performance, in accordance to the spectral approximations of BP given by the Bethe Hessian (see supplementary), and significantly outperforms performing 30 power iterations on that operator. We notice the line-graph version of our GNN slightly outperforms the baseline GNN, and that even the linear model that only considers residual connections reaches the statistical threshold. We also notice that our models outperform the Graph Attention Network (GAT)<sup>4</sup> in this task, which we also set to have 30 layers and 2 feature maps (Velickovic et al., 2017). A possible reason is that our graph operators include the degree matrix, which is important in sparse graphs to prevent hub nodes from dominating the diffusion. We ran experiments in the disassociative case ( $q > p$ ), as well as with  $C = 3$  communities, and obtained similar results, not reported here.

# 6.2 COMPUTATIONAL-TO-STATISTICAL THRESHOLDS IN THE SBM

The previous section showed that for small number of communities  $(k < 4)$ , the GNN-based model is able to reach the information theoretic (IT) threshold. In such regimes, it is known (Abbe, 2017; Massoulie, 2014; Coja-Oghlan et al., 2016) that BP provably reaches such IT threshold. The situation is different for  $k > 4$ , where it is conjectured that a computational-to-statistical gap emerges between the theoretical performance of MLE estimators and any polynomial-time estimation procedure (Decelle et al., 2011). In this context, one can use the GNN model to search the space of BP generalizations, and attempt to improve the detection performance of BP for signal-to-noise ratios falling within the computational-to-statistical

gap. Table 1 presents results for the 5-community disassociative case, with  $p = 0$  and  $q = 18/n$ , and  $n = 400$ . This amounts to solving a graph coloring problem in a sparse regime, which falls above the IT threshold but below the regime where BP is able to detect (Decelle et al., 2011), asymptotically as  $n \to \infty$ . We see that the GNN models significantly outperform BP in this regime, and that the line GNN version provides the best overlap performance, opening up the possibility to reduce the computation-information gap. That said, our model may be picking finite-size effects, which may vanish as  $n \to \infty$ ; the asymptotic study of these gains is left for future work.

# 6.3 REAL DATASETS FROM SNAP

We now train the GNNs on real datasets with community labels provided by SNAP. These datasets have ground truth community labels ranging from social networks to hierarchical co-purchasing networks. We obtain the training set as follows. For each SNAP dataset, we start by focusing only on the 5000 top quality communities provided by the dataset. We then identify edges  $(i,j)$  that cross at least two different communities. For each of such edges, we consider the two largest communities  $C_1,C_2$  such that  $i\notin C_2$  and  $j\notin C_1$ ,  $i\in C_1$ ,  $j\in C_2$ , and extract the subgraph determined by  $C_1\cup C_2$ , which is connected since all the communities are connected. Finally, we divide the train and test sets by enforcing test examples to contain disjoint communities from those in the training set. In this experiment, due to computational limitations, we restrict our attention to the three smallest graphs in the SNAP collection (Youtube, DBLP and Amazon), and we restrict the largest community size to 800 nodes, which is a conservative bound, since the average community size on these graphs is below 30. We compare our GNN's performance with the Community-Affiliation Graph Model (AGM) and with a variant of the LGNN that considers symmetric edge features instead of the non-backtracking operator, which fits into the framework of MPNNs (Gilmer et al., 2017) using ReLU activations. The AGM is a generative model defined in Yang & Leskovec (2012b) that allows overlapping communities where overlapping area have higher density. This was a statistical property observed in many real datasets with ground truth communities, but not present in generative models before AGM and was shown to outperform algorithms before that. Table 2 compares the performance, measured with a 3-class  $\{1,2,1 + 2\}$  classification accuracy up to global permutation  $1\leftrightarrow 2$ . It illustrates the benefits of data-driven models that strike the right balance between expressive power to adapt to model misspecifications and structural assumptions of the task at hand.

# 7 CONCLUSION

In this work we have studied data-driven approaches to community detection with graph neural networks. Our results confirm that, even when the signal-to-noise ratio is at the lowest detectable regime, it is possible to backpropagate detection errors through a graph neural network that can 'learn' to extract the spectrum of appropriate operators. This is made possible by considering a family of graph operators that work effectively in sparsely connected graphs, in particular by considering a hierarchical extension that uses the non-backtracking operator in the line graph. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the optimization landscapes in the linearized regime, which shows an interesting transition from rugged to simple as the size of the graphs increase under appropriate concentration conditions.

One word of caution is that our empirical results are inherently non-asymptotic. Whereas models trained for given graph sizes can be used for inference on arbitrarily sized graphs (owing to the parameter sharing of GNNs), further work is needed in order to understand the generalisation properties as  $|V|$  increases. Nevertheless, we believe our work opens up interesting questions, namely better understanding how our results on the energy landscape depend upon specific signal-to-noise ratios, or whether the network parameters can be interpreted mathematically. This could be useful in the study of computational-to-statistical gaps, where our model can be used to inquire about the form of computationally tractable approximations. Other directions of future research include the extension to the case where the number of communities is unknown and variable, and potentially increasing with  $|V|$ , as well as applications to ranking and edge-cut problems.
