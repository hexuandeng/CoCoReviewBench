# ABSTRACT

Diffusion-based generative models (DBGMs) perturb data to a target noise distribution and reverse this inference process to generate samples. The choice of inference diffusion affects both likelihoods and sample quality as it is tied to the generative model. Recent work in DBGMs has applied the principle of improving generative models with the use of auxiliary variables, leading to improved sample quality. While there are many such multivariate diffusions to explore, each new one requires significant model-specific analysis, hindering rapid prototyping and evaluation. In this work, we study Multivariate Diffusion Models (MDMs). First, for any number of auxiliary variables, we provide a recipe for maximizing a lower-bound on the MDMs likelihood, without requiring any model-specific analysis. Next, we demonstrate how to parameterize the diffusion for a specified target noise distribution; these two points together enable optimizing the inference diffusion process. Optimizing the diffusion expands easy experimentation from just a few well-known processes to an automatic search over the set of linear diffusions. To demonstrate these ideas, we introduce two new specific diffusions as well as learn a diffusion process on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. We achieve improved bits-per-dim bounds using the new diffusion, compared to the existing likelihood-trained VPSDE. We additionally connect the existing cld objective to the likelihood lower bound.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Diffusion-based generative models (DBGMs) perturb data to a target noise distribution and reverse this inference process to generate samples. They have achieved impressive performance in image generation, editing, translation (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021; Sasaki et al., 2021; Ho et al., 2022), conditional text-to-image tasks (Nichol et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2022; Sahara et al., 2022) and music and audio generation. (Chen et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2020; Mittal et al., 2021). They are trained for likelihood using a lower-bound on their likelihood featuring a variational process, often interpreted as gradually "noising" the data (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020b).

The choice of inference process affects both likelihoods and sample quality as it is tied to the generative model; on different datasets and models different process work better; there is no universal best choice of inference, and the choice matters (Song et al., 2020b). A given combination of model, inference, and choice of loss can face challenges such as unbounded gradients (Kim et al., 2021), mismatch of inference with the model prior, and large number of steps required for sampling (Zheng et al., 2022).

So how can diffusions be improved? A general principle in probabilistic modeling and inference is using auxiliary variables: HMC improves MCMC with Hamiltonian dynamics (Neal et al., 2011); Hierarchical variational inference (Ranganath et al., 2016) and hierarchical variational auto-encoders (Sonderby et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2018; Maaloe et al., 2019; Klushyn et al., 2019; Vahdat & Kautz, 2020; Child, 2020) marginalize auxiliary to build expressive inference distributions.

Dupont et al. (2019) shows that operating on an augmented state space in neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) allows a richer set of functions to modeled. (Huang et al., 2020) use this principle

for learning normalizing flows, where the authors maximize a joint likelihood  $p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e})$  where  $\mathbf{x} \sim q_{\mathrm{data}}$  and  $\mathbf{e} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$  to model richer distributions over  $\mathbf{x}$ .

Recent work in DBGMs has applied this principle to diffusions, leading to both stable training and improved sample quality. Based on connections with statistical mechanics, Dockhorn et al. (2021) introduce the critically-damped Langevin diffusion (CLD) for diffusion-based generative modeling. CLD diffuses an extra "velocity" variable together with each data dimension in an extended space. Empirically, CLD-based generative models have smoother scores leading to faster sampling, improved sampling quality and improved likelihood bounds. The extended space also allows them to choose dynamics that circumvent certain issues with unbounded gradients in score matching.

While there are many such auxiliary variable models to explore, models like CLD are evidence that each new process requires significant model-specific analysis. Deriving the likelihood lower-bound, also called the evidence lower bound (ELBO), for diffusions is challenging enough because models and inference are both specified in continuous time (Huang et al., 2021; Kingma et al., 2021; Durkan & Song, 2021). The derivations are typically carried out in a case-by-case manner. Auxiliary variables complicate this process further, for example computing the time-varying distribution of noise given data necessitates solving matrix Lyupanov equations. Deriving the stationary distribution of the inference process, which helps the model and inference match can be intractable. These challenges limit rapid prototyping and evaluation of new auxiliary variable diffusions.

Concretely, to train a diffusion model, possibly with auxiliary variables, one needs to:

(A1) Select a compatible inference-model process pair  
(A2) Derive the ELBO for this pair  
(A3) Sample the time-varying noise distribution and approximate the ELBO's gradients

In this work, we study Multivariate Diffusion Models (MDMs). MDMs extend the inference process for training diffusions from specific instantiations—like the variance-preserving stochastic differential equation (VPSDE) and CLD—to the set of linear diffusions with auxiliary variables.

First, for any number of auxiliary variables, we derive the likelihood lower bound (A2). Second, without requiring any model-specific analysis, we show that the transition kernels of linear MDMs can be computed automatically and generically, and scaled to higher-order auxiliary systems, without incurring significant cost (A3).

We then provide a parameterization of inference processes that can converge to a chosen model prior (A1); this tightens the likelihood lower-bound. We develop the parameterization by making a connection between diffusions models and the design of gradient-based MCMC samplers (Ma et al., 2015). The parameterization spans the set of all diffusions with a given stationary distribution.

With an ELBO, tractable kernels, and inference process parameterization, we can explore any number of linear MDMs. However as mentioned in Song et al. (2020b), the choice of the inference process is crucial and can vary based on the choice of the dataset and model.

The automatic transition kernels and fixed stationary distributions facilitate directly learning the inference process to maximize the MDM ELBO. This turns diffusion model training into a search not only over score models but also into an automatic search over the entire set of linear diffusions. This is at no extra mathematical or algorithmic cost, aside what it handled by auto-differentiation for some additional parameters. This extends the learning in Kingma et al. (2021) beyond VPSDE to diffusions with auxiliary variables and extends the successes of CLD to a larger class of models.

To demonstrate these ideas, we introduce two new specific linear diffusions, accelerated Langevin diffusion (ALDA) and modified accelerated Langevin diffusion (MALDA), as well learn a multivariate diffusion process, on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. We study the effect of these inference processes on DBGM training without needing to derive their sampling algorithms and objectives. Using MALDA and the learned SDE, we achieve impressive bits-per-dim bounds, compared to the existing likelihood-trained VPSDE and CLD on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.

Most importantly, the MDM framework makes it simple for practitioners and researchers to extend beyond the diffusions we explore in this work and those known in the literature.

# 2 SETUP

We describe diffusions similarly to Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015); Huang et al. (2021); Kingma et al. (2021); rather than starting with a noising (inference) process, and using time reversal to specify a model, we start with a model and then pick inference for which an ELBO can be derived. We use  $\mathbf{z}_t$  to describe the process under the generative model  $p_{\theta}$  using time variable  $t$  and  $\mathbf{y}_s$  for the process under inference distribution  $q_{\phi}$  using time variable  $s$ .

Model. Let  $\mathbf{B}_t$  be a Brownian motion and let  $\mathbf{z}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$  be a continuous-time stochastic process evolving according to:

$$
d \mathbf {z} = h _ {\theta} (\mathbf {z}, t) d t + \beta_ {\theta} (\mathbf {z}, t) d \mathbf {B} _ {t}. \tag {1}
$$

Diffusions sample a model prior  $\mathbf{z}_0\sim \pi_\theta$  and then integrate eq. (1) to approximate the data  $\mathbf{x}\sim q_{\mathrm{data}}$  with  $\mathbf{z}_T\sim p_\theta^1$ .

Inference. MLE training of diffusion models is intractable because computing their density  $p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_T)$  requires integrating over all possible Brownian paths (Huang et al., 2021; Durkan & Song, 2021; Kingma et al., 2021). Instead, one can introduce an inference process  $q_{\phi}(\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{x} = x)$  for each data value  $x$  and time  $s$  so that  $p_{\theta}$  can be trained using a variational lower bound on the log likelihood. The inference is chosen so that  $\lim_{t\to 0}q_{\phi}(\mathbf{y}_{t} = x|x) = 1$ . Like the model, the inference process is represented as a diffusion:

$$
d \mathbf {y} = f _ {\phi} (\mathbf {y}, s) d s + g _ {\phi} (\mathbf {y}, s) d \hat {\mathbf {B}} _ {s}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $\widehat{\mathbf{B}}_s$  is another Brownian motion independent of  $\mathbf{B}_t$ . The inference process is usually taken to be specified rather than learned, and chosen to be i.i.d. for each  $\mathbf{z}_{tj}$  conditional on each  $\mathbf{x}_j$ . This leads to the interpretation of the  $\mathbf{z}_{tj}$  as noisy versions of features  $\mathbf{x}_j$  (Ho et al., 2020).

Likelihood Lower Bound. How does one derive an elbo for models and inferences based on diffusion processes? As shown in Huang et al. (2021) and in appendix E, this relies on a particular likelihood ratio of the stochastic processes. The ratio can be computed by setting the generative processes' parameters as

$$
h _ {\theta} (\cdot , t) = g _ {\phi} ^ {2} (T - t) s _ {\theta} (\cdot , T - t) - f _ {\phi} (\cdot , T - t), \quad \beta_ {\theta} (t) = g _ {\phi} (T - t), \tag {3}
$$

for underlying score model  $s_{\theta}^2$ . Then, by Huang et al. (2021); Durkan & Song (2021), the ELBO can be written as  $\log p_{\theta}(x) \geq \mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{ism}}$  with:

$$
\mathcal {L} ^ {\mathrm {i s m}} (x) = \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} (\mathbf {y} | x)} \left[ \log \pi_ {\theta} (\mathbf {y} _ {T}) + \int_ {0} ^ {T} - \frac {1}{2} \| s _ {\theta} \| _ {g _ {\phi} ^ {2}} ^ {2} - \nabla \cdot \left(g _ {\phi} ^ {2} s _ {\theta} - f _ {\phi}\right) d s \right], \tag {4}
$$

where  $f_{\phi}, g_{\phi}, s_{\theta}$  are evaluated at  $(\mathbf{y}_s, s)$ , and  $||x||_A^2 = x^\top Ax$ . This features the Implicit Score Matching (ISM) loss plus terms that vary with  $\pi_{\theta}$  and  $q_{\phi}$  (Song et al., 2020a). The ISM ELBO can also be written as an alternate ELBO based on the Denoising Score Matching (DSM) loss (Vincent, 2011; Song et al., 2020b). We show a multivariate version of this in eq. (13).

# 3 MULTIVARIATE DIFFUSION MODELS

Auxiliary variables have been used to improve generative models in MCMC (Neal et al., 2011), Hierarchical Variational Inference (Ranganath et al., 2016), ladder variational autoencoder (Sonderby et al., 2016), among others. CLD (Dockhorn et al., 2021) explore this for a Langevin diffusion with one auxiliary "velocity" variable and show CLD requires fewer function evaluation to sample from the generative process, and the CLD score function is smoother compared to VPSDE's. Beyond CLD,

augmenting diffusions is not common because of apparent challenges: it is not immediately clear how to derive the necessary components of training DBGMs for multivariate diffusions.

In this work, we explore this question and extend the set of diffusions that can be used in diffusion objectives from CLD to any linear multivariate diffusion with auxiliary variables. This set also includes common scalar diffusions such as the Variance Preserving (VP) process (Song et al., 2020b).

At high level, MDMs pair  $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  with auxiliary variables  $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{d(K - 1)}$  and diffuse in the extended space:

$$
d \mathbf {u} _ {t} = \left( \begin{array}{c} d \mathbf {z} _ {t} \\ d \mathbf {v} _ {t} \end{array} \right) = h _ {\theta} (\mathbf {z} _ {t}, \mathbf {v} _ {t}, t) d t + \beta_ {\theta} (\mathbf {z} _ {t}, \mathbf {v} _ {t}, t) d \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathbf {B} _ {t} ^ {z} \\ \mathbf {B} _ {t} ^ {v} \end{array} \right).
$$

We proceed by deriving the MDM ELBO and providing a set of tools to work with it in practice.

# 3.1 MULTIVARIATE MODEL AND INFERENCE

The generative process  $p_{\theta}$  and inference process  $q_{\phi}$  are now over

$$
\mathbf {u} _ {t} = \left[ \mathbf {u} _ {t} ^ {z}, \mathbf {u} _ {t} ^ {v} \right] = \left[ \mathbf {z} _ {t}, \mathbf {v} _ {t} ^ {1}, \dots , \mathbf {v} _ {t} ^ {K - 1} \right], \quad \mathbf {y} _ {s} = \left[ \mathbf {y} _ {s} ^ {z}, \mathbf {y} _ {s} ^ {v} \right] = \left[ \mathbf {y} _ {s} ^ {z}, \mathbf {y} _ {s} ^ {v _ {1}}, \dots , \mathbf {y} _ {s} ^ {v _ {K - 1}} \right]. \tag {5}
$$

For each data feature  $\mathbf{x}_j$ , each  $\mathbf{u}_{tj} \in \mathbb{R}^K$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{sj} \in \mathbb{R}^K$  now consists of a primary "data" dimension (superscripts  $z$ ) and  $K - 1$  auxiliary variables (superscripts  $v$ ). There is a set of these variables for each data dimension  $j$ , so  $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{dK}$ . To specify MDMs, we extend the drift coefficient from a function in  $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}^d$  to the extended space  $\mathbb{R}^{dK} \times \mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}^{dK}$ . This function lets the  $z$  and  $v$  coordinates of  $\mathbf{u}$  interact. We likewise extend the diffusion coefficient to a matrix  $\beta_{\theta}$  acting on brownian motion  $\mathbf{B}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{dK}$ . We consider MDMs specified by:

$$
\mathbf {u} _ {0} \sim \pi_ {\theta}, \quad d \mathbf {u} = h _ {\theta} (\mathbf {u}, t) d t + \beta_ {\theta} (t) d \mathbf {B} _ {t}. \tag {6}
$$

MDMs model the data  $\mathbf{x}$  with  $\mathbf{z}_T$ , a coordinate in  $\mathbf{u}_T \sim p_\theta$ .

Because the MDM model is over the extended space, the inference distribution must be too. We then add an additional initial distribution over the auxiliary variable  $\mathbf{y}_0^v$  at time 0, which has an important role in section 3.2. We set  $q(\mathbf{y}_0^v |x)$  to be any chosen initial distribution, e.g.  $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I})$  and discuss this choice in section 4. Then  $\mathbf{y}_s$  evolves according to

$$
d \mathbf {y} = f _ {\phi} (\mathbf {y}, s) d s + g _ {\phi} (s) d \widehat {\mathbf {B}} _ {s}, \tag {7}
$$

where the inference drift and diffusion coefficients  $f_{\phi}, g_{\phi}$  are now over the extended space.

# 3.2 ELBO FOR MDMS

We now show how to train MDMs. We derive two lower bounds on the MDM data marginal log likelihood. We sketch a roadmap and show the result here, and include details in appendix E.

We start by reparameterizing the model drift  $h_{\theta}(\mathbf{u},t)$  and diffusion  $\beta_{\theta}(t)$  as in the scalar case in eq. (3). Then, the multivariate ELBO can be derived straightforwardly by starting with the bound in eq. (4) for  $\log p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})$ , applying it to the joint space  $p_{\theta}([\mathbf{u}_T^z,\mathbf{u}_T^v])$ , and then marginalizing  $\mathbf{u}_T^v$  under the time-zero inference distribution  $q_{\phi}(\mathbf{y}_0^v |x)$ .

First, by applying diffusion models to  $\mathbf{u}_T$  instead of  $\mathbf{z}_t$ , the ISM bound is:

$$
\mathcal {L} ^ {i s m} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {T} = [ x, v ]\right) = \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} (\mathbf {y} | \mathbf {y} _ {0} = [ x, v ])} \left[ \underbrace {\log \pi_ {\theta} \left(\mathbf {y} _ {T}\right)} _ {\ell_ {T}} + \int_ {0} ^ {T} \underbrace {- \frac {1}{2} \| s _ {\theta} \| _ {g _ {\phi} ^ {2}} ^ {2} - \nabla \cdot \left(g _ {\phi} ^ {2} s _ {\theta} - f _ {\phi}\right)} _ {\rho^ {\mathrm {i s m}}} d s \right], \tag {8}
$$

where  $g^2 (s)$  denotes  $g(s)g(s)^{\top}$ . By the diffusion ELBO derivation, the bound satisfies:

$$
\log p _ {\theta} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {T} = [ x, v ]\right) \geq \mathcal {L} ^ {\mathrm {i s m}} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {T} = [ x, v ]\right). \tag {9}
$$

Next, for any joint, for any  $q_{\phi}$  such that  $p_{\theta} / q$  is finite, we can appeal to Jensen's inequality and change of measure to lower-bound the log marginal:

$$
\log p _ {\theta} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {T} ^ {z} = x\right) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} \left(\mathbf {y} _ {0} ^ {v} = v \mid x\right)} \left[ \log p _ {\theta} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {T} ^ {z} = x, \mathbf {u} _ {T} ^ {v} = v\right) - \log q _ {\phi} \left(\mathbf {y} _ {0} ^ {v} = v \mid x\right) \right]. \tag {10}
$$

We can therefore use  $q(\mathbf{y}_0^v | x)$  together with  $\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{ism}}(\mathbf{u}_T)$  to lower-bound the data log marginal likelihood:

$$
\log p _ {\theta} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {T} ^ {z} = x\right) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} \left(\mathbf {y} _ {0} ^ {v} = v \mid x\right)} \left[ \mathcal {L} ^ {\text {i s m}} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {T} = [ x, v ]\right) \underbrace {- \log q _ {\phi} \left(\mathbf {y} _ {0} ^ {v} = v\right)} _ {\ell_ {q}} \right]. \tag {11}
$$

The ISM ELBO for MDMs, (derived in appendix E) can then be written as  $\log p_{\theta}(x)\geq \mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{mdm - ism}}$  , with

$$
\mathcal {L} ^ {\text {m i s m}} = \mathbb {E} _ {q} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {s \sim \operatorname {U n i f} (0, T)} \left[ \ell_ {s} ^ {(i s m)} \cdot T \right] + \ell_ {T} + \ell_ {q} \right]. \tag {12}
$$

Like in the scalar case, the MDM ISM ELBO can be transformed into an equal MDM DSM ELBO  $\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{mdsm}} = \mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{mism}}$ . Let  $\nabla \log q_{s|0}$  denote either  $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}_s}\log q(\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0)$  or  $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}_s}\log q(\mathbf{y}_s|x)$ , and define:

$$
\ell_ {s} ^ {(d s m)} = \frac {1}{2} \left| \left| \nabla \log q _ {s | 0} \right| \right| _ {g _ {\phi}} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{2} \left| \left| s _ {\theta} - \nabla \log q _ {s | 0} \right| \right| _ {g _ {\phi}} ^ {2} + \nabla_ {\mathbf {y} _ {s}} \cdot f _ {\phi}. \tag {13}
$$

The MDM DSM bound  $\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{mdsm}}$  takes the same form as  $\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{mism}}$  but with  $\ell_s^{(dsm)}$  in place of  $\ell_s^{(ism)}$  (appendix F). We now provide 3 ingredients for tightening and optimizing these bounds in a generic fashion.

# 3.3 INGREDIENT 1: COMPUTING THE TRANSITION  $q_{\phi}(\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0)$

To compute the ELBOs, we need two things from the transition kernel, (a) samples  $\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0$  and computing the transition kernel terms in eqs. (12) and (13). For linear MDMs, we can sample and compute transitions in closed form without requiring any diffusion specific analysis.

For linear diffusions, the transition kernel  $q(\mathbf{u}_s|\mathbf{u}_0)$  is always Gaussian (Särkkä & Solin, 2019). Therefore, we just find the mean  $\mathbf{m}_{s|0}$  and covariance  $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{s|0}$  of  $q(\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0)$ . The mean and covariance are solutions to ODEs discussed in appendix C. Let  $f(\mathbf{y}, s) = \mathbf{A}(s)\mathbf{y}$ . The mean is:

$$
\mathbf {m} _ {s \mid 0} = \exp \left[ \int_ {0} ^ {s} \mathbf {A} (\nu) d \nu \right] \mathbf {y} _ {0} \underbrace {= \exp (s \mathbf {A}) \mathbf {y} _ {0}} _ {\text {n o i n t e g r a t i o n i f} \mathbf {A} (\nu) = \mathbf {A}} \tag {14}
$$

where  $\exp$  denotes matrix exponential. We will express the covariance of  $q(\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0)$  as  $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{s|0} = \mathbf{C}_s\mathbf{H}_s^{-1}$  where, letting  $I_{s}[\mathbf{A}] = \int_{0}^{s}\mathbf{A}(\nu)d\nu$

$$
\binom {\mathbf {C} _ {s}} {\mathbf {H} _ {s}} = \exp \left[ \left( \begin{array}{c c} I _ {s} [ \mathbf {A} ] & I _ {s} \left[ g ^ {2} \right] \\ \mathbf {0} & - I _ {s} \left[ \mathbf {A} ^ {\top} \right] \end{array} \right) \right] \binom {\boldsymbol {\Sigma} _ {0}} {\mathbf {I}} \underbrace {\exp \left[ s \binom {\mathbf {A} ^ {2}} {\mathbf {0}} - \mathbf {A} ^ {\top} \right]} _ {\text {n o i n t e g r a t i o n i f} \mathbf {A} (\nu) = \mathbf {A}, g (\nu) = g}. \tag {15}
$$

Conditioning on  $\mathbf{u}_0 = (x, v)$  amounts to setting  $\pmb{\Sigma}_0 = \mathbf{0}$ . Finally,  $\pmb{\Sigma}_{s|0} = \mathbf{C}_s\mathbf{H}_s^{-1}$ .

Hybrid Score Matching. Instead of computing  $q(\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0)$ , we can apply the hybrid score matching principle (Dockhorn et al., 2021) to reduce variance by compute objectives using  $q(\mathbf{y}_s|x)$  instead of  $q(\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0)$ , which amounts to integrate out  $\mathbf{v}_0$ . Formally, we show the equality of the ELBO with  $q(\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0)$  swapped-out for  $q(\mathbf{y}_s|x)$  in appendix F. To accomplish this, we simply replace  $\mathbf{y}_0$  with  $[x,\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{v}_0]]$  in the expression for  $\mathbf{m}_{s|0}$ , and for  $\pmb{\Sigma}_{s|0}$ , we replace the choice of  $\mathbf{0}$  for  $\pmb{\Sigma}_0$  instead with a block matrix featuring  $\pmb{\Sigma}_{0,zz} = 0$ , and  $\pmb{\Sigma}_{0,zv}$ ,  $\pmb{\Sigma}_{0,vv}$  set to the chosen distribution for  $q_{\phi}(\mathbf{y}_0^v |\mathbf{y}_0^z)$ .

A fast and simple algorithm. Instead of solving the mean and covariance ODEs analytically like CLD (see for instance pages 50-54 of Dockhorn et al. (2021)), we provide a simple algorithm to compute the mean and covariance which only require knowing the functions  $f, g$ , see algorithm 1 in appendix H. This makes the ELBO tractable and easy, i.e. skips both analytic derivations and numerical integration during training.

Table 1: Runtime Comparison: we compare the run time of sampling from the CLD diffusion analytically versus using our automated algorithm.

For scalar diffusions, the drift  $A$  and diffusion  $g$  coefficients are scalars. For MDMs,  $\mathbf{A}, g$  are  $K \times K$ . Similar to scalar diffusions, these parameters are shared across

coordinates, where each matrix acts on a  $K$ -dimensional vector  $\left[(\mathbf{y}^z)_j, (\mathbf{y}^{v_1})_j, \ldots, (\mathbf{y}^{v_{K-1}})_j\right]$  for  $j \in \{1, \ldots, d\}$ . This means that the matrix operations requiring matrix exponentials and inverses are done on  $K \times K$  matrices. In table 1, we compare the time to sample a batch of size 256 from the transition kernel for the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets. The table shows the extra computational cost of the automated algorithm is negligible.

We have accomplished tractable transition computation by restricting to linear processes, which include most diffusions used in the mainstream literature (VP, sub-VP, Variance Exploding (VE), CLD) and even extends to the general multivariate case for any number of auxiliary variables.

# 3.4 INGREDIENT 2: MDM PARAMETERIZATION

The MDM ELBO eq. (8) is higher when the inference distribution tends toward the model's prior. Thus in ingredient 2, we construct inference processes with the model prior  $\pi_{\theta}$  as their stationary distribution  $q_{\infty}$ . Ma et al. (2015) provide a complete recipe for constructing gradient-based MCMC samplers; they span all Markov diffusion processes with a given stationary distribution for the general non-linear case, which we extend to the time-varying processes.

For the linear case, the parameterization simplifies to

$$
d \mathbf {y} = \underbrace {- [ \mathbf {Q} (s) + \mathbf {D} (s) ] \nabla \mathbf {H} (\mathbf {y})} _ {f} d s + \underbrace {\sqrt {2 \mathbf {D} (s)}} _ {g} d \widehat {\mathbf {B}} _ {s}, \tag {16}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Q}$  is skew-symmetric  $(-\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{Q}^{\top})$ ,  $\mathbf{D}$  is positive semi-definite and  $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{y}) = -\log q_{\infty}(\mathbf{y})$ . In this work, we choose linear processes meaning  $\nabla \mathbf{H}$  must be linear and therefore  $q_{\infty}$  must be Gaussian. Therefore, eq. (16) spans all linear processes with a stationary distribution, and we can compute automatic transition kernels for these processes.

In appendix C, we show the transition kernel computation in the  $\mathbf{Q} / \mathbf{D}$  parameterization, with an algorithm in Appendix H. We show the ELBO in terms of  $\mathbf{Q} / \mathbf{D}$  in appendix G.

# 3.5 INGREDIENT 3: LEARNING THE INFERENCE PROCESS

Song et al. (2020b) show that the choice of the optimal inference process varies for different datasets and score models. However, training DBGMs requires computing the transition kernel and being able to parameterize diffusions processes. This prevented training DBGMs in the multivariate setting, let alone the inference process.

We observe that the ELBOs in eq. (12) and eq. (13) have no requirement for a fixed inference, and propose to learn the inference process jointly with the model in multivariate MDMs. Under the linear transitions (ingredient 1) and stationary parameterization (ingredient 2), learning the inference comes at no cost; we can do so without the stationary distribution going awry, and because transitions are computed generically, no algorithmic details change when learning. Learning the inference alongside the model is well-motivated in previous literature as in variational auto-encoders, where the encoder (inference) and decoder (model) are learned jointly (Kingma & Welling, 2013).

We can analyze how learning the inference process is expected to help diffusion ELBOs specifically. First,  $q_{\phi,\infty}$  may be set to equal  $\pi_{\theta}$ , but it is  $q_{\phi,T}$  for the chosen  $T$  that is featured in the ELBO. Learning the inference will reduce the cross-entropy:

$$
- \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} (\mathbf {y} _ {T} | x)} \left[ \log \pi_ {\theta} (\mathbf {y} _ {T}) \right]. \tag {17}
$$

Minimizing this term will tighten the ELBO for any score model. Next,  $q_{\phi}$  is featured in the remaining DSM and ISM terms; optimizing for  $q_{\phi}$  in those terms will tighten and improve the ELBO alongside the score model. Finally,  $q_{\phi}$  is featured in the expectations and the  $-\log q_{\phi}$  term:

$$
\log p _ {\theta} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {T} ^ {\tilde {z}} = x\right) \geq \underbrace {\mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} \left(\mathbf {y} _ {0} ^ {v} = v \mid x\right)}} \left[ \mathcal {L} ^ {\text {i s m}} \left(\mathbf {u} _ {T} = [ x, v ]\right) \underbrace {- \log q _ {\phi} \left(\mathbf {y} _ {0} ^ {v} = v\right)} \right] \tag {18}
$$

These terms impose an optimality condition that  $p_{\theta}(\mathbf{u}_T^v |\mathbf{u}_T^z) = q_{\phi}(\mathbf{y}_0^v |\mathbf{y}_0^z)$  (appendix D), similar to the role of  $-\log q$  in the traditional ELBO (Blei et al., 2017). When it is satisfied, no looseness in the ELBO for the marginal likelihood of just the data  $x$  is due to the initial time zero auxiliary variables.

The only change is that  $\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{D}$  need to be specified with parameters that enable gradients, and we have to use re-parameterized samples  $\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0$ . For parameterization,

- Any skew-symmetric matrix  $\mathbf{Q}$  can be written as  $\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{G} - \mathbf{G}^{\top}$  for some  $\mathbf{G}_{\phi}$ ; therefore we can set  $\mathbf{Q}_{\phi}(s) = \beta(s) \cdot [\mathbf{G}_{\phi} - \mathbf{G}_{\phi}^{\top}]$  for an unconstrained parameter  $\mathbf{G}_{\phi}$  
- For any positive semi-definite matrix  $\mathbf{D}$ , there exists a matrix  $\mathbf{B}$  such that  $\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{BB}^{\top}$ ; therefore we can set  $\mathbf{D}_{\phi}(s) = \beta(s) \cdot [\mathbf{B}_{\phi} \mathbf{B}_{\phi}^{\top}]$  for unconstrained  $\mathbf{B}_{\phi}$

We provide more details on parameterization in appendix B.

# 4 INSIGHTS INTO MULTIVARIATE DIFFUSIONS

Scalar versus Multivariate Processes. The parameterization in eq. (16) clarifies what can change and what cannot to preserve the stationary distribution. Recall that  $\mathbf{Q}$  and  $\mathbf{D}$  are each  $K\times K$  where there are  $K - 1$  auxiliary variables. Because 0 is the only  $1\times 1$  skew-symmetric matrix, this means that scalar processes must set  $\mathbf{Q} = 0$ . With a standard normal stationary distribution, the resulting process is:

$$
d \mathbf {y} = - \mathbf {D} (s) \mathbf {y} d s + \sqrt {2 \mathbf {D} (s)} d \widehat {\mathbf {B}} _ {s}. \tag {19}
$$

What is left is precisely the VP process used widely in diffusion models where  $\mathbf{D}(s) = \frac{1}{2}\beta (s)$  (Song et al., 2020b). This reveals that the VP process is the only scalar diffusion with a stationary distribution. This also clarifies the role of  $\mathbf{Q}$ : it accounts for mixing between dimensions in multivariate processes, as do non-diagonal entries in  $\mathbf{D}$ .

CLD optimizes a lower bound on the data log-likelihood. The initial distribution  $q(\mathbf{y}_0^v | x)$  appears in several places in MDM ellbos. Looking at eqs. (12) and (13), we establish that the CLD objective is an ELBO without the  $-\log q$ . Because their  $q_{\phi}$  is constant, their objective is formally maximizing a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of the data, not just the extended space.

Combining MDMs and hybrid score matching. The choice in CLD to set  $q(\mathbf{y}_0^v |x) = q(\mathbf{y}_0^v)$  has certain good properties when combined with CLD's D matrix and hybrid score matching. The matrix has a 0 in the top-left coordinate which means that DSM does not match scores of the main coordinates. Because hybrid score matching samples  $q(\mathbf{y}_s|x)$  rather than  $q(\mathbf{y}_s|\mathbf{y}_0)$ , the score-matching gradients at time zero are bounded. The new SDEs that we explore in the experiments share these properties, and the principle is useful for designing new and learned linear MDMs in general.

Does my model use auxiliary variables? In section 3 we gave the example choice of  $q(\mathbf{y}_0^v |x) = q(\mathbf{y}_0^v) = \mathcal{N}(0,1)$  coordinate-wise. It is also a common choice to set  $\pi_{\theta}$  as independent standard Gaussians for all variables. Because the optimum in diffusion models is  $p_{\theta} = q$  for all  $t$ , we see a peculiar phenomenon under this choice: the model has main and auxiliary dimensions independent at both endpoints 0 and  $T$ . Does this mean that the model does not use auxiliary variables? In appendix A, we show that even when  $q_{\phi}(\mathbf{y}_0)$  and  $\pi_{\theta}$  have main and auxiliary variables independent at the end points, the model uses the auxiliary variables in the intermediate time. A sufficient condition is  $\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{D}$  is non-diagonal. On the other hand, when  $\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{0}$  and  $\mathbf{D}$  is diagonal, under the independent endpoints, the model will not use the auxiliary variables to model the primary coordinate  $\mathbf{u}_T^z$ .

Existing diffusion processes. We show in appendix B.4 that existing diffusion processes such as VPSDE and CLD can also fit in the  $\mathbf{Q} / \mathbf{D}$  parameterization. In appendix B.4, we show that the error incurred in computing the transition kernel's mean and covariance is negligible.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

We test the MDM framework by testing two new specific diffusions and a learned diffusion. The two specific diffusions are (a) ALDA, introduced in Mou et al. (2019) as a scheme for accelerated gradient-based MCMC sampling (eq. (26)) and (b) MALDA: a modified version of ALDA (eq. (27)). Both of the specific diffusions have two auxiliary variables, see appendix B.4 for details. We compare the performance of these three diffusions against VPSDE and ELBO-trained CLD.

Following Song et al. (2020b); Dockhorn et al. (2021); Huang et al. (2021) we train DBGMs on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets for image generation. For both datasets, we use the modified U-Net architecture used in Ho et al. (2020); Huang et al. (2021). We input the auxiliary variables as extra channels, which leads to a negligible increase in parameter count. We use simple uniform dequantization; we do not tighten the bounds with variational dequantization or IwAE (Burda et al., 2015) for evaluation.

Table 2 shows that the inference process matters. Despite similar parameter counts for the score model, MALDA and the learned inference processes are able to achieve significantly lower bits-per-dim compared to diffusions models with a similar parameter count.

In table 3, we show that our diffusion processes are able to achieve close to start of the art bits-per-dim for both CIFAR10 and MNIST, with a significantly smaller number of parameters. In fig. 1 samples we plot the generated samples from CIFAR10 from the different DBGMs we have introduced.

A trend in generative models and in inference algorithms is to augment them with auxiliary variables. For example, (Neal et al., 2011) improves MCMC with Hamiltonian dynamics. (Ranganath et al., 2016; Sønderby et al., 2016) improve variational inference with hierarchy and hierarchical variational auto-encoders (Sønderby et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2018; Maaløe et al., 2019; Klushyn et al., 2019; Vahdat & Kautz, 2020; Child, 2020). We apply this principle and diffuse in an augmented space.

One motivation for MDMs is to enrich the class of distributions that diffusions model in practice. Song et al. (2020b) show that for any DBGM, there is a deterministic neural ODE (Chen et al., 2018; Grathwohl et al., 2018), called the probability flow ODE, whose trajectories match the diffusion's. Dupont et al. (2019) prove that there exist functions that neural ODEs cannot represent. However, augmenting the state space of neural ODEs increases the set of functions that can be represented marginally on the original dimension of interest. They demonstrate that smoother transformations due to the use of augmented variables led to fewer function evaluations for integrating and stable training. Huang et al. (2020) use this to improve normalizing flows by applying the flow in an extended space. The work we present on diffusions with auxiliary variables can be seen as an application of this principle to diffusion based models, or equivalently, continuous normalizing flows.

Durkan & Song (2021); Huang et al. (2021) derive the ISM and DSM lower-bounds on the model log likelihood. Our work extends their analysis to the multivariate diffusion setting to derive lower bounds on the joint and marginal data likelihoods.

Kingma et al. (2021) show how to learn the inference process for VPSDE, that is learning the  $\beta(s)$  function. For MDMs,  $\mathbf{Q}$  can be non-zero; this shows that there are more choices to be made and learned in multivariate diffusions, compared to the scalar case. Additionally, one can choose the matrix  $\mathbf{D}$  to be diagonal or full, give  $\mathbf{Q}$  and  $\mathbf{D}$  different time-varying functions, and learn  $\nabla \mathbf{H}$ .

Vahdat et al. (2021); Rombach et al. (2022) transform the data using auto-encoders and diffuse in a latent space. Future work is to use MDMs in concert with such encodings to yield effectively non-linear multivariate diffusions with automatic transitions.

# 7 DISCUSSION

In this work, we provide a complete recipe for training MDMs. For any linear diffusion, we automate the transition kernel computation and sampling, removing the need for model specific analysis. We provide a parameterization of diffusions that have a specified noise distribution. Following Durkan & Song (2021); Huang et al. (2021) we provide a tractable ELBO to train MDM models. Finally, we show that for any number of auxiliary variables, we can learn the inference process, extending Kingma et al. (2021) beyond VPSDE. Our experiments show that we achieve state of the art bits-per-dim with significantly smaller models.
