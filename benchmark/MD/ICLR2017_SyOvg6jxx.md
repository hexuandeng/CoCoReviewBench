# ABSTRACT

Count-based exploration algorithms are known to perform near-optimally when used in conjunction with tabular reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solving small discrete Markov decision processes (MDPs). It is generally thought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state spaces, since most states will only occur once. Recent deep RL exploration strategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces through complex heuristics, often relying on optimism in the face of uncertainty or intrinsic motivation. In this work, we describe a surprising finding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach near state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous deep RL benchmarks. States are mapped to hash codes, which allows to count their occurrences with a hash table. These counts are then used to compute a reward bonus according to the classic count-based exploration theory. We find that simple hash functions can achieve surprisingly good results on many challenging tasks. Furthermore, we show that a domain-dependent learned hash code may further improve these results. Detailed analysis reveals important aspects of a good hash function: 1) having appropriate granularity and 2) encoding information relevant to solving the MDP. This exploration strategy achieves near state-of-the-art performance on both continuous control tasks and Atari 2600 games, hence providing a simple yet powerful baseline for solving MDPs that require considerable exploration.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Reinforcement learning (RL) studies an agent acting in an initially unknown environment, learning through trial and error to maximize rewards. It is impossible for the agent to act near-optimally until it has sufficiently explored the environment and identified all of the opportunities for high reward, in all scenarios. A core challenge in RL is how to balance exploration—actively seeking out novel states and actions that might yield high rewards and lead to long-term gains; and exploitation—maximizing short-term rewards using the agent's current knowledge. While there are exploration techniques for finite MDPs that enjoy theoretical guarantees, there are no fully satisfying techniques for high-dimensional state spaces; therefore, developing more general and robust exploration techniques is an active area of research.

Most of the recent state-of-the-art RL results have been obtained using simple exploration strategies such as uniform sampling (Mnih et al., 2015) and i.i.d. / correlated Gaussian noise (Schulman et al., 2015; Lillicrap et al., 2015). Although these heuristics are sufficient in tasks with well-shaped rewards, the sample complexity can grow exponentially (with state space size) in tasks with sparse rewards (Osband et al., 2016b). Recently developed exploration strategies for deep RL have led to significantly improved performance on environments with sparse rewards. Bootstrapped DQN

(Osband et al., 2016a) led to faster learning in a range of Atari 2600 games by training an ensemble of  $Q$ -functions. Intrinsic motivation methods using pseudo-counts achieve state-of-the-art performance on Montezuma's Revenge, an extremely challenging Atari 2600 game (Bellemare et al., 2016). Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME, Houthooft et al. (2016)) encourages the agent to explore by acquiring information about environment dynamics, and performs well on various robotic locomotion problems with sparse rewards. However, we have not seen a very simple and fast method that can work across different domains.

Some of the classic, theoretically-justified exploration methods are based on counting state-action visitations, and turning this count into a bonus reward. In the bandit setting, the well-known UCB algorithm of Lai & Robbins (1985) chooses the action  $i$  at time  $t$  that maximizes  $\hat{r}_i + \sqrt{\frac{2\log t}{n_i}}$  where  $\hat{r}_i$  is the estimated reward, and  $n_i$  is the number of times action  $i$  was previously chosen. In the MDP setting, some of the algorithms have similar structure, for example, Model Based Interval Estimation-Exploration Bonus (MBIE-EB) of Strehl & Littman (2008) counts state-action pairs with a table  $n(s,a)$  and adding a bonus reward of the form  $\beta / \sqrt{n(s,a)}$  to encourage exploring less visited pairs. Kolter & Ng (2009) show that the inverse-square-root dependence is optimal. MBIE and related algorithms assume that the augmented MDP is solved analytically at each timestep, which is only practical for small finite state spaces.

This paper presents a simple approach for exploration, which extends classic counting-based methods to high-dimensional, continuous state spaces. We discretize the state space with a hash function and apply a bonus based on the state-visitation count. The hash function can be chosen to appropriately balance generalization across states, and distinguishing between states. We select problems from RLLab (Duan et al., 2016) and Atari 2600 (Bellemare et al., 2012) featuring sparse rewards, and demonstrate near state-of-the-art performance on several games known to be hard for naive exploration strategies. The main strength of the presented approach is that it is fast, flexible and complementary to most existing RL algorithms.

In summary, this paper proposes a generalization of classic count-based exploration to high-dimensional spaces through hashing (Section 2); demonstrates its effectiveness on challenging deep RL benchmark problems and analyzes key components of well-designed hash functions (Section 3).

# 2 METHODOLOGY

# 2.1 NOTATION

This paper assumes a finite-horizon discounted Markov decision process (MDP), defined by  $(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},P,R,\rho_0,\gamma ,T)$ , in which  $\mathcal{S}$  is the state space,  $\mathcal{A}$  the action space,  $P$  a transition probability distribution,  $R$  a reward function,  $\rho_0$  an initial state distribution,  $\gamma \in (0,1]$  a discount factor, and  $T$  the horizon. The goal of RL is to maximize the total expected discounted reward  $\mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left[\sum_{t = 0}^{T}\gamma^{t}R(s_{t},a_{t})\right]$  over policy  $\pi$ , which outputs a distribution over actions given a state.

# 2.2 COUNT-BASED EXPLORATION VIA HASHING

Our approach discretizes the state space with a hash function function  $\phi : S \to \mathbb{Z}$ . We add an exploration bonus to the reward, defined as

$$
R ^ {+} \left(s _ {t}, a _ {t}\right) = \frac {\beta}{\sqrt {n \left(\phi \left(s _ {t}\right)\right)}}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $\beta$  is the bonus coefficient and initially the counts  $n(\phi(s))$  are set to zero for all states  $s$ . For every state encountered at time step  $t$ , the count  $n(\phi(s_t))$  is increased by one. The agent is trained with reward  $(R + R^+)$ , while performance is evaluated as the sum of rewards without bonuses.

Note that our approach is a departure from count-based exploration methods such as MBIE-EB since we use a state-space count  $n(s)$  rather than a state-action count  $n(s, a)$ . We tried using counts  $n(s, a)$ , but did not notice any significant performance gains.

Clearly the performance of this method will strongly depend on the choice of hash function  $\phi(s)$ . One important choice we can make regards the granularity of the discretization: we would like for

Algorithm 1: Count-based exploration through hashing  
1 Define state preprocessor  $g:\mathcal{S}\to \mathbb{R}^d$    
2 Initialize matrix  $A$  with entries drawn i.i.d. from standard Gaussian  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$    
3 Initialize a hash table with values  $n(\cdot)\equiv 0$

"distant" states to be counted separately and "similar" states to be counted together. If desired, we can incorporate prior knowledge into the choice of  $\phi$ , if there is a set of features of the state that we know to be relevant (and thus should be counted).

Algorithm 1 summarizes our method. The main idea is to use locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to convert continuous, high-dimensional data to discrete hash codes. LSH is a popular class of hash functions for querying nearest neighbors based on certain similarity metrics (Andoni & Indyk, 2006). A computationally efficient type of LSH is SimHash (Charikar, 2002), which measures similarity by angular distance. SimHash retrieves a binary code of state  $s \in S$  as

$$
\operatorname {s g n} (A g (s)) \in \{- 1, 1 \} ^ {k}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $g: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}^d$  is a pre-processor (see Section 2.3) and  $A$  is a  $k \times d$  matrix with i.i.d. entries drawn from standard Gaussian  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . Using a larger  $k$  value is more likely to distinguish states and hence leads to higher granularity.

# 2.3 STATE PREPROCESSING

When the states are presented as images, measuring their similarity directly in the pixel space is well known to fail to provide the semantic similarity measure one would desire. Previous work on computer vision (Lowe, 1999; Dalal & Triggs, 2005; Tola et al., 2010) introduce manually designed feature representations of images that are suitable for semantic tasks including detection and classification. More recent methods learn complex features directly from data by training convolutional neural networks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2015). Considering theses results, it may be difficult for SimHash to cluster states appropriately using only raw pixels. Therefore here we propose the following methods to preprocess states and to extract hand-designed or learned features for hashing Atari game images.

BASS: Basic Abstraction of the ScreenShots (BASS, also called Basic; see Bellemare et al. (2012)) is a hand-designed feature for images in Atari games. BASS builds on the following observations specific to Atari: 1) the game screen has a low resolution, 2) most objects are large and monochrome, and 3) winning depends mostly on knowing object locations and motions. We designed an adapted version of  $\mathrm{BASS}^1$ , which divides the RGB screen into square cells, computes the average intensity of each color channel inside a cell, and assigns the resulting values to bins that uniformly partition the intensity range [0, 255]. Mathematically, let  $C$  be the cell size (width and height),  $B$  the number of bins,  $(i,j)$  cell location,  $(x,y)$  pixel location, and  $z$  the channel. Then

$$
\operatorname {f e a t u r e} (i, j, z) = \left\lfloor \frac {B}{2 5 5 C ^ {2}} \sum_ {(x, y) \in \operatorname {c e l l} (i, j)} I (x, y, z) \right\rfloor . \tag {3}
$$

Afterwards, the resulting integer-valued feature tensor is converted to an integer hash code ( $c_t$  in Line 6 of Algorithm 1). A BASS feature can be regarded as a miniature that efficiently encodes object locations, but remains invariant to negligible object motions. It is easy to implement and introduces little computation overhead. However, it is designed for generic Atari game images and may not capture the structure of each specific game very well.

Learned embedding: In additional to hand-designed features like BASS, we also propose a learning-based method that is able to focus on important domain-dependent features. The idea is that a learned code should encode salient features, which can prove useful for counting.

In particular, the model is an autoencoder (AE) consisting of convolutional, fully connected and deconvolutional layers. One special fully connected layer is comprised of  $K$  saturating activation functions, e.g. sigmoid functions. By rounding the output of this layer  $b(s)$  to the closest binary number, we can transform any state  $s$  into a binary code. To make sure that distinct binary codes are learned, uniform noise  $U(-0.3, 0.3)$  is added to the sigmoid output (Gregor et al., 2016). This way, the autoencoder is only capable of reconstructing the input if it assigns values that are spaced out sufficiently, in which case rounding to a binary code makes sense. In order to make the autoencoder train sufficiently fast, its output is comprised of a pixel-wise softmax layer (van den Oord et al., 2016), sharing weights between all pixels. The different output bins represent discrete pixel intensities. The architecture is described in Appendix A.1 and depicted in Figure 5. The loss function over a set of collected states  $\{s_i\}_{i=1}^N$  is

$$
L \left(\left\{s _ {i} \right\} _ {i = 1} ^ {N}\right) = - \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \left[ \log p \left(s _ {i}\right) - \frac {\lambda}{K} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \min  \left\{\left(1 - b _ {k} \left(s _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {2}, b _ {k} \left(s _ {i}\right) ^ {2} \right\} \right]. \tag {4}
$$

This objective function consists of a negative log-likelihood term and a term that forces the continuous code layer values to either 0 or 1. The reason is that noise alone is insufficient if the autoencoder chooses not to use a particular sigmoid unit, in which case it is arbitrarily forced to a binary value. If this is not applied, the code is more prone to oscillations, causing unwanted bit flips, destabilizing the counting process. Because the code dimension often needs to be large in order to correctly reconstruct the input, we apply a downsampling procedure to the resulting binary code, either through random projection to a lower-dimensional space or through grouping bits together. Finally, the resulting downsampled bit string is fed to the SimHash procedure as in Line 6 of Algorithm 1.

It is important that the mapping from state to code needs to remain relatively consistent over time, which is nontrivial as the autoencoder is constantly updated according to the latest data. An obvious solution would be to significantly downsample the binary code to a very low dimension, or by slowing down the training process. However, the code has to remain relatively unique for states that are both distinct and close together on the image manifold. This is tackled both by the second term in Eq. (4) and by the saturating behavior of the sigmoid units. As such, states that are already well represented in the autoencoder tend to saturate the sigmoid units, causing the resulting loss gradients to be close to zero and making the code less prone to change.

# 3 EXPERIMENTS

We design experiments to investigate the following questions:

1. Can count-based exploration through hashing improve performance significantly across different domains? How does the proposed method compare to the current state of the art in exploration for deep RL?  
2. What is the impact of state preprocessing on the overall performance of image inputs?  
3. What factors contribute to good performance, e.g., what is the appropriate level of granularity of the hash function?

To answer question 1, we test the proposed method on deep RL benchmarks (RLLab and Atari) featuring sparse rewards and compare to other state-of-the-art algorithms. Question 2 is answered with trying out different image preprocessors on Atari games. Finally, we investigate question 4 in Section 3.3 and 3.4.

We choose Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO, Schulman et al. (2015)) as the learning algorithm for all experiments, since it can conveniently ensure stable improvement in the policy performance. The hyper-parameters are reported in the Appendix A.1.

# 3.1 RLLAB

RLLab (Duan et al., 2016) is a benchmark consisting of control tasks for deep RL algorithms. We selected several variants of the basic and locomotion tasks that use sparse rewards and adopt the experimental setup as defined in (Houthooft et al., 2016); a description can be found in Appendix A.3. These tasks are all very difficult to solve with naive exploration strategies, such as adding Gaussian noise to the actions.

Figure 2 shows the results of TRPO (baseline), TRPO-SimHash, and VIME (Houthooft et al., 2016) on classic tasks MountainCar and CartPoleSwingup, the locomotion task HalfCheetah, and the hierarchical task SwimmerGather. Using count-based exploration with hashing is capable of obtaining the sparse rewards in all environments, while baseline TRPO with Gaussian control noise fails completely. Although TRPO-SimHash picks up the sparse reward on HalfCheetah, it does not perform as well as VIME. In contrast, the performance of SimHash is comparable with VIME on MountainCar, while it outperforms VIME on SwimmerGather.

# 3.2 ARCADE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE, Bellemare et al. (2012)), which consists of Atari 2600 video games, is an important benchmark for deep RL due to its high-dimensional state space and wide variety of games. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy, six games are selected featuring long horizons while requiring significant exploration: Freeway, Frostbite, Gravitar, Montezuma's Revenge, Solaris, and Venture. The agent is trained for 500 iterations in all experiments, with each iteration consisting of  $0.1\mathrm{M}$  steps (the TRPO batch size, corresponds to  $0.4\mathrm{M}$  frames). Policies and value functions are neural networks with identical architectures to (Mnih et al., 2016). Although the policy and baseline take into account the previous four frames, the algorithm only takes into account the latest frame.

We compare our results to double DQN (van Hasselt et al., 2016b),ueling network (Wang et al., 2016),  $\mathrm{A3C + }$  (Bellemare et al., 2016),double DQN with pseudo-counts² (Bellemare et al., 2016), Gorila (Nair et al., 2015), and DQN Pop-Art (van Hasselt et al., 2016a) on the "null op" metric³. We show training curves in Figure 3 and summarize all results in Table 1. Surprisingly, TRPO-pixel-SimHash already outperforms the baseline by a large margin and beats the previous best result on

Frostbite. TRPO-BASS-SimHash achieves significant improvement over TRPO-pixel-SimHash on Montezuma's Revenge and Venture, where it captures object locations better than other methods.  ${}^{4}$  TRPO-AE-SimHash achieves near state-of-the-art performance on Freeway, Frostbite and Solaris.

As observed in Table 1, preprocessing images with BASS or AE leads to much better performance on Gravitar, Montezuma's Revenge and Venture. Therefore the preprocessing step can be important for a good hash function.

In conclusion, our count-based exploration method is able to achieve remarkable performance gains even with simple hash functions like SimHash on the raw pixel space. If coupled with domain-dependent state preprocessing techniques, it can sometimes achieve far better results.

# 3.3 GRANULARITY

While our proposed method is able to achieve remarkable results without requiring much tuning, the granularity of the hash function should be chosen wisely. Granularity plays a critical role in count-based exploration, where the hash function should cluster states without under-generalizing or over-generalizing. Table 2 summarizes granularity parameters for our hash functions. In Table 3 we summarize the performance of TRPO-pixel-SimHash under different granularities. We choose Frostbite and Venture on which TRPO-pixel-SimHash outperforms the baseline, and choose as reward bonus coefficient  $\beta = 0.01 \times \frac{256}{k}$  to keep average bonus rewards at approximately the same scale.  $k = 16$  only corresponds to 65536 distinct hash codes, which is insufficient to distinguish between semantically distinct states and hence leads to worse performance. We observed that  $k = 512$  tends to capture trivial image details in Frostbite, leading the agent to believe that every state is new and equally worth exploring. Similar results are observed while tuning the granularity parameters for TRPO-BASS-SimHash and TRPO-AE-SimHash.

The best granularity depends on both the hash function and the MDP. While adjusting granularity parameter, we observed that it is important to lower the bonus coefficient as granularity is increased. Because higher granularity is likely to cause lower state counts, leading to higher bonus rewards that may overwhelm the true rewards.

# 3.4 A CASE STUDY OF MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE

Montezuma's Revenge is widely known for its extremely sparse rewards and difficult exploration (Bellemare et al., 2016). While our method does not achieve state-of-the-art results on this game, we investigate the reasons behind this through various experimental settings. The experiment process below again demonstrates the importance of a hash function having the correct granularity and encoding relevant information for solving the MDP.

Our first attempt is to use game RAMs instead of images as inputs to the policy (details in Appendix A.1), which leads to obtain a game score of 2500 with TRPO-BASS-SimHash. Our second attempt is to manually design a hash function that incorporates domain knowledge, called SmartHash, which uses an integer-valued vector consisting of the agent's  $(x,y)$  location, room number and other useful RAM information as the hash code (details in Appendix A.2). The best SmartHash agent is able to obtain a score of 3500. Still the performance is not optimal. We observe that a slight change in the agent's coordinates does not always result in a semantically distinct state, and thus the hash code may remain unchanged. Therefore we choose grid size  $s$  and replace the  $x$  coordinate by  $\lfloor (x - x_{\mathrm{min}}) / s \rfloor$  (similarly for  $y$ ). The bonus coefficient is chosen as  $\beta = 0.01\sqrt{s}$  to maintain the scale relative to the true reward<sup>6</sup> (see Table 4). Finally, the best agent is able to obtain 6600 total rewards after training for 1000 iterations (1000 M time steps), with a grid size  $s = 10$ .

![](images/8387183079a694dfb34136b5c4dd04ccb1c71a567dbc9158aff0b704990e0128.jpg)  
Figure 4: SmartHash results on Montezuma's Revenge (RAM observations): the solid line is the mean average undiscounted return per iteration, while the shaded areas represent the one standard deviation, over 5 seeds.

During our pursuit, we had another interesting discovery that the ideal hash function should not simply cluster states by their visual similarity, but instead by their relevance to solving the MDP. We experimented with including enemy locations in the first two rooms into SmartHash ( $s = 10$ ), and observed that average score dropped to 1672 (at iteration 1000). Though it is important for the agent to dodge enemies, the agent also erroneously "enjoys" watching enemy motions at distance (since new states are constantly observed) and "forgets" that his main objective is to enter other rooms. An alternative hash function keeps the same entry "enemy locations", but instead only puts randomly sampled values in it, which surprisingly achieves better performance (3112). However, by ignoring enemy locations altogether, the agent achieves a much higher score (5661) (see Figure 4). In retrospect, we examine the hash codes generated by BASS-SimHash and find that codes clearly distinguish between visually different states (including various enemy locations), but fails to emphasize that the agent needs to explore different rooms. Again this example showcases the importance of encoding relevant information in designing hash functions.

# 4 RELATED WORK

Classic count-based methods such as MBIE (Strehl & Littman, 2005), MBIE-EB and (Kolter & Ng, 2009) solve an approximate Bellman equation as an inner loop before the agent takes an action (Strehl & Littman, 2008). As such, bonus rewards are propagated immediately throughout the state-action space. In contrast, contemporary deep RL algorithms propagate the bonus signal based on rollouts collected from interacting with environments, with value based (Mnih et al., 2015) or policy-gradient based (Schulman et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2016) methods, at limited speed. In addition, our proposed method is intended to work with contemporary deep RL algorithms, it differs from classical count-based method in that our method relies on visiting unseen states first, before the bonus reward can be assigned, making uninformed exploration strategies still a necessity at the beginning. Filling the gaps between our method and classic theories is an important direction of future research.

A related line of classical exploration methods is based on the idea of optimism in the face of uncertainty (Brafman & Tennenholtz, 2002) but not restricted to using counting to implement "optimism", e.g. R-Max (Brafman & Tennenholtz, 2002), UCRL (Jaksch et al., 2010), and  $\mathbf{E}^3$  (Kearns & Singh, 2002). These methods, similar to MBIE and MBIE-EB, have theoretical guarantees in tabular settings.

Bayesian RL methods (Kolter & Ng, 2009; Guez et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2011; Ghavamzadeh et al., 2015), which keep track of a distribution over MDPs, are an alternative to optimism-based methods. Extensions to continuous state space have been proposed by Pazis & Parr (2013) and Osband et al. (2016b).

Another type of exploration is curiosity-based exploration. These methods try to capture the agent's surprise about transition dynamics, and seeking surprise for the agent will lead it to discover novel states. We refer the reader to Schmidhuber (2010) and Oudeyer & Kaplan (2007) for an extensive review on curiosity and intrinsic rewards.

Several exploration strategies for deep RL have been proposed to handle high-dimensional state space recently. Houthooft et al. (2016) propose VIME, in which information gain is measured in Bayesian neural networks modeling the MDP dynamics, which is used as exploration bonus. Stadie et al. (2015) propose to use the prediction error of a learned dynamics model as an exploration bonus. Thompson sampling through bootstrapping is proposed by Osband et al. (2016a), using bootstrapped Q-functions.

The most related exploration strategy is proposed by Bellemare et al. (2016), in which an exploration bonus is added inversely proportional to the square root of a pseudo-count quantity. A state pseudo-count is derived from its log-probability improvement according to a density model over the state space, which in the limit converges to the empirical count. Our method is similar to pseudo-count approach in the sense that both methods are performing approximate counting to have the necessary generalization over unseen states. The difference is that a density model has to be designed and learned to achieve good generalization for pseudo-count whereas in our case generalization is obtained by a wide range of simple hash functions (not necessarily SimHash). Another method similar to hashing is proposed by Abel et al. (2016), which clusters states and counts cluster centers instead of the true states, but this method has yet to be tested on standard exploration benchmark problems.

# 5 CONCLUSIONS

This paper demonstrates that a generalization of classical counting techniques is able to provide an appropriate signal for exploration, even in continuous and/or high-dimensional MDPs with function approximators, resulting in near state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks. It provides a simple yet powerful baseline for solving MDPs that require informed exploration.
