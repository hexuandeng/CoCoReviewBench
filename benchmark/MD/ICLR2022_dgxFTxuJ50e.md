# ABSTRACT

Among a wide range of success of deep learning, convolutional neural networks have been extensively utilized in several tasks such as speech recognition, image processing, and natural language processing, which require inputs with large dimensions. Several studies have investigated function estimation capability of deep learning, but most of them have assumed that the dimensionality of the input is much smaller than the sample size. However, for typical data in applications such as those handled by the convolutional neural networks described above, the dimensionality of inputs is relatively high or even infinite. In this paper, we investigate the approximation and estimation errors of the (dilated) convolutional neural networks when the input is infinite dimensional. Although the approximation and estimation errors of neural networks are affected by the curse of dimensionality in the existing analyses for typical function spaces such as the Hölder and Besov spaces, we show that, by considering anisotropic smoothness, they can alleviate exponential dependency on the dimensionality but they only depend on the smoothness of the target functions. Our theoretical analysis supports the great practical success of convolutional networks. Furthermore, we show that the dilated convolution is advantageous when the smoothness of the target function has a sparse structure.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep learning has shown high performance in several tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and dilated CNNs have been quite effective in tasks involving high-dimensional data (van den Oord et al., 2016; He et al., 2016; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; Yoon, 2014). However, many aspects of its theoretical nature are still unclear while related theoretical studies have attracted much attention. Aside from the analysis of CNNs, one of the most fundamental issues in deep learning theories is its function approximation and estimation capabilities. For example, it is well known that any continuous function with compact support can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by a two-layer fully connected neural network (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik, 1991). Moreover, the representation ability of deep learning to approximate a function in some function classes such as Hölder classes has also been extensively analyzed (Mhaskar & Micchelli, 1992; Mhaskar, 1993; Chui et al., 1994; Mhaskar, 1996; Pinkus, 1999; Yarotsky, 2017; Petersen & Voigtlaender, 2017). In addition to the approximation ability, the estimation ability of deep learning for estimating a function by a finite sample has also been extensively studied. For example, Schmidt-Hieber (2020) derived the estimation error bound of deep learning with ReLU activation (Nair & Hinton, 2010; Glorot et al., 2011) to estimate functions in the Hölder space and showed the rate of convergence achieves the (near) minimax optimal rate. Suzuki (2019) derived approximation and estimation error rates of deep learning with ReLU activation for the Besov spaces, which were also shown to be (near) minimax optimal. Although the derived rates of convergence are near optimal, these studies assumed that the dimensionality of inputs is fixed and much smaller than the sample size. Indeed, the derived rates suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, in practice, we often encounter settings where the input dimensionality is larger than the sample size or even infinite. For example, in image recognition and natural language processing, the dimensionality of inputs (images or texts) is very large, and they could be seen as almost infinite dimensional.

To address this issue, some researches considered a setting where the dimensionality of the support of the data distribution is low dimensional. Chen et al. (2019b;a) considered a setting where data can be embedded in a low dimensional sub-manifold and derived the approximation error of functions that depends merely on the dimensionality of the sub-manifold instead of that of the entire space. Nakada & Imaizumi (2020) also considered a similar setting, and showed that the estimation error is characterized by the Minkowski dimension of the support of the data distribution. Suzuki (2019) showed that, even if the data cannot be embedded in a low dimensional manifold, anisotropic smoothness of the target function can mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Although these studies revealed that deep learning can avoid curse of dimensionality by utilizing some low dimensional structures of data and the target functions, it still remains unclear how deep learning performs for very high dimensional settings including an infinite dimensional setting. See Table 1 for a summarized comparison to existing studies.

In terms of infinite dimensional inputs, there have been already several studies on approximation and estimation errors for non-deep-learning methods. For example, so called hyperbolic cross approximation has been considered to approximate a function in a tensor product space with support on  $[0,1]^\infty$  (Düng & Griebel, 2016) and a polynomial order approximation is possible for functions with mixed smoothness, that is, specific summability properties of the smoothness indices are fulfilled. Ingster & Stepanova (2011) analyzed a Gaussian white noise model with an infinite dimensional input and showed that the estimation accuracy for signals on infinite dimensional anisotropic Sobolev spaces depends on the reciprocal sum of the smoothness per axis (see also Ingster & Stepanova (2006); Ingster & Suslina (2007); Ingster & Stepanova (2009)). Oliva et al. (2013; 2015) proposed methods to estimate a map where the input and output are functions or distributions, and derive the rate of convergence. Ferraty et al. (2007) analyzed the Nadaraya-Watson estimator when the inputs are functions, derived the convergence rate of the estimator, and gave the asymptotic confidence band in the context of functional data analysis (see Ling & Vieu (2018) as a comprehensive survey of the nonlinear functional data analysis literature). However, these researches are not for the deep learning and the benefit of deep learning for such situation has not been well characterized in the literature.

In this study, we analyze the approximation and estimation accuracy in a setting where the input is infinite dimensional, and derive their convergence rates. We assume that the true function has mixed and anisotropic smoothness, that is, the function has different smoothness toward different coordinate similarly to Dung & Griebel (2016); Ingster & Stepanova (2011). The intuition behind this setting is as follows: Considering a function which takes an image as an input, an image can be decomposed into different frequency components and usually a function of images has less sensitivity on the high frequency components and more dependent on the low frequency components, which can be formulated as non-uniform smoothness toward each coordinate direction. By considering such a setting, we can show that the rate of convergence can avoid the curse of dimensionality and be of polynomial order. Our contribution can be summarized as follows:

1. We consider a learning problem in which the target function to be approximated or estimated can take an infinite dimensional input and has mixed or anisotropic smoothness. Then, we show that deep learning by fully connected neural networks can achieve approximation and estimation errors that depend only on smoothness of the target function and are independent of the dimensionality.  
2. We also consider a setting where the smoothness of the target function has a sparse structure, and then we show that dilated CNNs can find appropriate variables and improve the rate of convergence. This indicates that CNNs can capture a long range dependence among the input.

These results show that even when the dimension  $d$  of the data is very large compared to the number of observations  $n$ , or even when the input is infinite dimensional, it is possible to derive a polynomial order estimation error bound that depends only on the smoothness of the function class. This analysis partially explains the great success of CNNs in various applications with high dimensional inputs.

# 2.1 REGRESSION PROBLEM WITH INFINITE DIMENSIONAL PREDICTOR

In this paper, we consider a regression problem where the predictor (input) is infinite dimensional. Let  $\lambda$  be the uniform probability measure on  $([0,1],\mathcal{B}([0,1]))$  where  $\mathcal{B}([0,1])$  is the Borel  $\sigma$ -field on  $[0,1]$ , and let  $\lambda^{\infty}$  be the product measure of  $\lambda$  on  $([0,1]^{\infty},\mathcal{B}([0,1]^{\infty}))$  where  $\mathcal{B}([0,1]^{\infty})$  is the product  $\sigma$ -algebra generated by the cylindric sets  $\cap_{j\leq d}\{x\in [0,1]^{\infty}:x_j\in B_j\}$  for  $d = 1,2,\ldots$  and  $B_{j}\in \mathcal{B}([0,1])$ . Let  $P_{X}$  be a probability measure defined on the measurable space  $([0,1^{\infty},\mathcal{B}([0,1^{\infty}))$  that is absolutely continuous to  $\lambda^{\infty}$  and its Radon-Nikodym derivative satisfies  $\| \frac{\mathrm{d}P_X}{\mathrm{d}\lambda^\infty}\|_{L^\infty ([0,1]^\infty)} < \infty^1$ . Then, suppose that there exists a true function  $f^{\mathrm{o}}:[0,1]^{\infty}\to \mathbb{R}$ , and consider the following nonparametric regression problem with an infinite dimensional input:

$$
Y = f ^ {\mathrm {o}} (X) + \xi , \tag {1}
$$

where  $X$  is a random variable taking its value on  $[0,1]^{\infty}$  and obeys the distribution  $P_{X}$  introduced above, and  $\xi$  is a observation noise generated from  $N(0,\sigma^2)$  (a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance  $\sigma^2 > 0$ ). Let  $P$  be the joint distribution of  $X$  and  $Y$  obeying the regression model.

What we investigate in the following is (i) how efficiently we can approximate the true function  $f^{\mathrm{o}}$  by a neural network, and (ii) how accurately deep learning can estimate the true function  $f^{\mathrm{o}}$  from  $n$  observations  $D_{n} = (X_{i},y_{i})_{i = 1}^{n}$  where  $(X_{i},y_{i})_{i = 1}^{n}$  are i.i.d. observations from the model. As a performance measure, we employ the mean squared error  $\| f - f^{\mathrm{o}}\|_{P_X}^2 \coloneqq \operatorname{E}_P[(f(X) - f^{\mathrm{o}}(X))^2]$ , which can be seen as the excess risk of the predictive error  $\operatorname{E}_{(X,Y)\sim P}[(f(X) - Y)^2]$  associated with the squared loss (i.e.,  $\| f - f^{\mathrm{o}}\|_{P_X}^2 = \operatorname{E}_{(X,Y)\sim P}[(f(X) - Y)^2] - \operatorname{E}_{(X,Y)\sim P}[(f^{\mathrm{o}}(X) - Y)^2] = \operatorname{E}_{(X,Y)\sim P}[(f(X) - Y)^2] - \inf_{f:\text{measurable}}\operatorname{E}_{(X,Y)\sim P}[(f(X) - Y)^2])$ .

# 2.2 MIXED AND ANISOTROPIC SMOOTHNESS ON INFINITE DIMENSIONAL VARIABLES

Here, we introduce a function class in which we suppose the true function  $f^{\mathrm{o}}$  is included. For a given

$$
l \in \mathbb {Z} _ {0} ^ {\infty},   \text {d e f i n e}     \psi_ {l _ {i}}: [ 0, 1 ] \to \mathbb {R}   \text {a s}     \psi_ {l _ {i}} (x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \sqrt {2} \cos (2 \pi | l _ {i} | x) & (l _ {i} <   0), \\ \sqrt {2} \sin (2 \pi | l _ {i} | x) & (l _ {i} > 0), \text {f o r} x \in [ 0, 1 ], \text {a n d} \\ 1 & (l _ {i} = 0), \end{array} \right.
$$

define  $\psi_{l}(X) := \prod_{i=1}^{\infty} \psi_{l_i}(x_i)$  for  $X = (x_i)_{i=1}^{\infty} \in [0,1]^{\infty}$ . Let  $L^2([0,1]^{\infty}) := \{f : [0,1]^{\infty} \to \mathbb{R} : \int_{[0,1]^{\infty}} f^2(x) \mathrm{d}\lambda^{\infty}(x) < \infty\}$  equipped with the inner product  $\langle f, g \rangle := \int_{[0,1]^{\infty}} f(x) g(x) \mathrm{d}\lambda^{\infty}(x)$  for  $f, g \in L^2([0,1]^{\infty})$ . Then,  $(\psi_l)_{l \in \mathbb{Z}_0^\infty}$  forms a complete orthonormal system of  $L^2([0,1]^{\infty})$ , that is,  $f \in L^2([0,1]^{\infty})$  can be expanded as  $f(X) = \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}_0^\infty} \langle f, \psi_l \rangle \psi_l(X)$  (see Ingster & Stepanova (2011) for example). For  $s \in \mathbb{N}_0^\infty$ , let  $\delta_s(f) : \mathbb{R}^\infty \to \mathbb{R}$  be

$$
\delta_ {s} (f) (\cdot) = \sum_ {l \in \mathbb {Z} _ {0} ^ {\infty}: \lfloor 2 ^ {s _ {i} - 1} \rfloor \leq | l _ {i} | <   2 ^ {s _ {i}}} \langle f, \psi_ {l} \rangle \psi_ {l} (\cdot),
$$

which can be seen as the frequency component of  $f$  of frequency  $|l_i| \simeq 2^{s_i}$  toward each coordinate. We also define  $\| f \|_p \coloneqq \left( \int_{[0,1]^\infty} |f|^p \, \mathrm{d}\lambda^\infty \right)^{1/p}$  for  $p \geq 1$ . Then, we define a function space with a general smoothness configuration as follows.

Definition 1 (Function class with  $\gamma$ -smoothness). For a given  $\gamma : \mathbb{N}_0^\infty \to \mathbb{R}_{>0}$  which is monotonically non-decreasing with respect to each coordinate. For  $p \geq 1$ ,  $\theta \geq 1$ , we define the  $\gamma$ -smooth space as

$$
\mathcal {F} _ {p, \theta} ^ {\gamma} ([ 0, 1 ] ^ {\infty}) := \left\{f = \sum_ {l \in \mathbb {Z} _ {0} ^ {\infty}} \langle f, \psi_ {l} \rangle \psi_ {l}: \left(\sum_ {s \in \mathbb {N} _ {0} ^ {\infty}} 2 ^ {\theta \gamma (s)} \| \delta_ {s} (f) \| _ {p} ^ {\theta}\right) ^ {1 / \theta} <   \infty \right\},
$$

equipped with the norm  $\| f\|_{\mathcal{F}_{p,\theta}^{\gamma}}\coloneqq \left(\sum_{s\in \mathbb{N}_0^\infty}2^{\theta \gamma (s)}\| \delta_s(f)\| _p^\theta\right)^{1 / \theta}$ .

In the following,  $\mathcal{F}_{p,\theta}^{\gamma}([0,1]^{\infty})$  is abbreviated to  $\mathcal{F}_{p,\theta}^{\gamma}$ , and its unit ball is denoted by  $U(\mathcal{F}_{p,\theta}^{\gamma})$ . Remind that  $\delta_s(f)$  represents the frequency component associated with the frequency  $(2^{s_i})_{i=1}^{\infty}$ , and then the norm of the  $\gamma$ -smooth space imposes weight  $2^{\theta \gamma(s)}$  on each frequency component associated with  $s$ . In that sense,  $\gamma(s)$  controls the weight of each frequency component and accordingly a function in the space can have different smoothness toward different coordinates. As a special case of  $\gamma(s)$ , we investigate the following ones in this paper. We can see that a finite dimensional analysis can be easily reduced to a special case of the infinite dimensional analysis (see Appendix A). In that sense, our analysis generalizes existing finite dimensional analyses.

Definition 2 (Mixed smoothness and anisotropic smoothness). Given a monotonically nondecreasing sequence  $a = (a_i)_{i=1}^{\infty} \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}^{\infty}$ , we define the mixed smoothness as

(mixed smoothness)  $\gamma (s) = \langle a,s\rangle$

where  $\langle a,s\rangle \coloneqq \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}a_{i}s_{i}^{2}$ , and define the anisotropic smoothness as

(anisotropic smoothness)  $\gamma (s) = \max \{a_{i}s_{i}:i\in \mathbb{N}\} .$

Each component  $a_i$  of  $a = (a_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}$  represents the smoothness of the function with respect to the variable  $x_i$ . Since we assumed  $(a_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}$  is monotonically non-decreasing, a function in the space has higher smoothness toward the coordinate  $x_i$  with higher index  $i$ . In other words, the function  $f$  in the space is less sensitive to the variable  $x_i$  with a larger index  $i$ . For example, in computer vision tasks, we may suppose  $x_i$  with a large index  $i$  corresponds to a higher frequency component of the input image, and then the function is less sensitive to such high frequency components and more sensitive to a low-frequency "global" information. This can be seen as an infinite dimensional variant of the mixed smooth Besov space (Schmeisser, 1987; Sickel & Ullrich, 2009) and the anisotropic Besov space (Nikol'skii, 1975; Vybiral, 2006; Triebel, 2011) (see Appendix C for detailed discussions). In our theoretical analysis, we will assume that the true target function  $f^{\mathrm{o}}$  is included in the  $\gamma$ -smooth function space.

Assumption 3. The target function satisfies  $f^{\mathrm{o}} \in U(\mathcal{F}_{p,\theta}^{\gamma})$  with  $p \geq 1$  and  $\theta \geq 1$ , and  $\| f^{\mathrm{o}}\|_{\infty} \leq B_f$  for a fixed constant  $B_f > 0$ , where the smoothness  $\gamma$  is either the mixed smoothness or the anisotropic smoothness.

# 3 RELATION TO EXISTING WORK

A function space with the mixed smoothness in a finite dimensional setting can be found in Schmeisser (1987); Sickel & Ullrich (2009), in which the mixed smooth Besov space is defined. The approximation and estimation errors of deep neural networks for the mixed smooth Besov space were analyzed by Suzuki (2019) for a special setting of  $a_1 = \dots = a_d$ , and an approximation error analysis for  $a_1 = \dots = a_d = 2$  was given by Montanelli & Du (2019) using a sparse-grid technique. The mathematical properties of the anisotropic Besov space with finite dimensional input were analyzed in Nikol'skii (1975); Vybiral (2006); Triebel (2011). The statistical analysis on the anisotropic

Besov space can be back to Ibragimov & Khas'minskii (1984) and they derived the minimax optimal rate for density estimation where the density is in an anisotropic Besov space. Nyssbaum (1983; 1987) also analyzed a nonparametric regression problem on an anisotropic Besov space. The approximation and estimation error bounds by deep neural networks for composition functions in anisotropic Besove spaces and superiority of deep learning compared to the kernel methods are shown by Suzuki & Nitanda (2021). However, all of these studies are about finite dimensional input and it is far from trivial to generalize it to the infinite dimensional setting.

Our analysis for the  $\gamma$ -smooth function space is closely related to Ingster & Stepanova (2011) in which the anisotropic Sobolev space defined by  $\mathcal{F}_c = \mathcal{W}_2^a \coloneqq \left\{f \in L^2([0,1]^\infty) : \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left\| \frac{\partial^a f}{\partial x_i^{a_i}} \right\|_2^2 < \infty \right\}$  is analyzed. They also derived a similar convergence rate to ours for non-deep learning estimator for a Gaussian white noise model. In the literature of the functional data analysis, the Nadaraya-Watson estimator for functional input has been extensively studied (Ferraty et al. (2007) and Ling & Vieu (2018) for a comprehensive survey). If we apply the bound given in the literature to our setting, the learning rate can be  $1/poly-\log(n)$  which is much slower than our analysis. This is because their analysis does not make use of  $\gamma$ -smoothness. See Appendix C for more details.

Kohler & Langer (2020) analyzed CNNs in a setting where the target function has a hierarchical max-pooling structure each layer of which is sufficiently smooth. On the other hand, our  $\gamma$ -smooth function class imposes smoothness more directly on the target function. Liu et al. (2021) analyzed learning ability of CNNs with a ResNet structure in a classification task where the data are distributed on a low-dimensional manifold and established a rate which only depends on the dimensionality of the low dimensional manifold. However, the input should be distributed on a low dimensional manifold, while our analysis allows its support to be infinite dimensional. Estimation errors on a low dimensional structure also have been studied in Yang & Dunson (2016); Bickel & Li (2007); Nakada & Imaizumi (2020); Schmidt-Hieber (2019); Chen et al. (2019b).

# 4 DEFINITION OF AN DILATED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

In this section, we introduce the neural network model that we investigate in this paper. Let  $L \in \mathbb{N}$  be the depth of the network and  $d_{i}$  ( $i = 1, \dots, L + 1$ ) be the width of the  $i$ -th layer in the network where we set  $d_{L + 1} = 1$ . Then, the fully connected neural network (FNN) can be given by  $(A_{L}\eta(\cdot) + b_{L}) \circ \dots \circ (A_{i}\eta(\cdot) + b_{i}) \circ \dots \circ (A_{1}x + b_{1})$  where  $A_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i + 1} \times d_{i}}$ ,  $b_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i + 1}}$  and  $\eta(x) = \max\{x, 0\}$  is the ReLU activation function that is applied element-wise. The set of FNN with depth  $L \in \mathbb{N}$ , maximum width  $W \in \mathbb{N}$ , norm bound  $B > 0$ , and sparsity level  $S \in \mathbb{N}$  is defined by

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Phi (L, W, S, B) := \left\{f (x) = \left(A _ {L} \eta (\cdot) + b _ {L}\right) \circ \dots \circ \left(A _ {i} \eta (\cdot) + b _ {i}\right) \circ \dots \circ \left(A _ {1} x + b _ {1}\right): \right. \\ \max  _ {i = 1, \dots , L} \| A _ {i} \| _ {\infty} \vee \| b _ {i} \| _ {\infty} \leq B, \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {L} \| A _ {i} \| _ {0} + \| b _ {i} \| _ {0} \leq S, \max  _ {i = 1, \dots L} d _ {i} \leq W \Big \}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\| \cdot \|_{\infty}$  is the maximum absolute value among the elements of a vector or matrix<sup>3</sup>, and  $\| \cdot \|_{0}$  is the number of non-zero elements of a vector or matrix.

Next, we define the (dilated) CNNs. Let  $C \in \mathbb{N}$  be the number of channels and  $\mathbb{R}^{C \times \infty} \coloneqq \{(x_1, \ldots, x_i, \ldots) : x_i \in \mathbb{R}^C\}$ . Suppose that  $w \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times W'}$  is a filter with a width  $W' \in \mathbb{N}$ , channel size  $C \in \mathbb{N}$  and an interval  $h \in \mathbb{N}$ , then define the dilated convolution  $w \star_h X' \in \mathbb{R}^\infty$  for an infinite-sequence of vectors  $X' = (x_{i,j}')_{i=1,j=1}^{C,\infty} \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times \infty}$  as  $(w \star_h X')_k = \sum_{i=1}^{C} \sum_{j=1}^{W'} w_{i,j} x_{i,h(j-1)+k}''$ . When  $h = 1$ , it is called a normal convolution. Moreover, given a filter  $F \in \mathbb{R}^{C' \times C \times W'}$  with  $(C')$ -multiple channel outputs, we define its corresponding convolution  $\mathrm{Conv}_{h,F} : \mathbb{R}^{C \times \infty} \to \mathbb{R}^{C' \times \infty}$  as

$$
\operatorname {C o n v} _ {h, F} (X ^ {\prime}) = \left( \begin{array}{c} F _ {1,:,:} \star_ {h} X ^ {\prime} \\ \vdots \\ F _ {C ^ {\prime},,:,:} \star_ {h} X ^ {\prime} \end{array} \right).
$$

Then, the dilated CNN can be defined as follows.

Definition 4 (Dilated CNN). For a given  $L'$ ,  $W' \in \mathbb{N}$ , suppose that we are given filters  $F_l \in \mathbb{R}^{C_{l+1} \times C_l \times W'}$  with the number of channels  $C_l \in \mathbb{N}$  ( $l \in [L']$ ) with  $C_1 = 1$  and an FNN  $g_{\mathrm{FNN}} \in \Phi(L, W, B, S)$ , then a neural network given by  $f(X) = (g_{\mathrm{FNN}} \circ \mathrm{Conv}_{W'L' - 1, F_{L'}} \circ \dots \circ \mathrm{Conv}_{W^{l-1}, F_l} \circ \dots \circ \mathrm{Conv}_{1, F_1} \circ X)_{1}$  is called a dilated CNN, where  $g_{\mathrm{FNN}}$  is assumed to be applied in an element-wise manner to the infinite sequence. The set of dilated CNNs with the same number of channels  $C_l = C'$  ( $2 \leq \forall l \leq L'$ ) in all layers but  $C_1 = 1$  is denoted by

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {P} \left(L ^ {\prime}, B ^ {\prime}, W ^ {\prime}, C ^ {\prime}, L, W, S, B\right) = \left\{\left(g _ {\mathrm {F N N}} \circ \operatorname {C o n v} _ {W ^ {\prime} L ^ {\prime} - 1, F _ {L ^ {\prime}}} \circ \dots \circ \operatorname {C o n v} _ {1, F _ {1}} \circ X\right) _ {1}: \right. \\ F _ {l} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {C ^ {\prime} \times C ^ {\prime} \times W ^ {\prime}} (l \geq 2), F _ {1} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {C ^ {\prime} \times 1 \times W ^ {\prime}}, \| F _ {l} \| _ {\infty} \leq B ^ {\prime}, g _ {\mathrm {F N N}} \in \Phi (L, W, B, S) \Big \}. \\ \end{array}
$$

For simplicity, the set of dilated CNNs is abbreviated to  $\mathcal{P}$  when there is no ambiguity about the parameter configuration. When  $L' = 1$ , it coincides with a set of regular CNNs. In our analysis, it is sufficient to consider an dilated CNN with a constant number of channels throughout all layers ( $C_l = C$  ( $\forall l \in [L']$ )). To evaluate the estimation accuracy, it is important to assume the functions in the set is bounded in terms of the  $L_{\infty}$ -norm. For that purpose, we consider an dilated CNN clipped by a bound  $B_f > 0$  defined as  $\bar{\mathcal{P}}(B_f, L', B', W', C, \bar{L}, W, S, B) := \{\bar{f}(X) = (-B_f \vee (B_f \wedge f(X)): f \in \mathcal{P}(L', B', W', C, L, W, S, B)\}$ .

Remark 5. In the definition of the dilated CNN, we do not impose ReLU activation. However, since ReLU activation can realize a linear function for a bounded input and thus our analysis can be straightforwardly applied even if there is nonlinear ReLU activation. Moreover, this paper mainly focuses on 1D-convolution, but it can be generalized to 2D-convolution. See Appendix I for the detailed discussions in which it is shown that  $\gamma$ -smoothness over a wavelet decomposition of an input image achieves the same rate of convergence as in 1D-convolution.

# 5 APPROXIMATION AND ESTIMATION ERRORS OF DEEP LEARNING

In this section, we give our main result about the approximation and estimation errors of FNNs and dilated CNNs when the true function  $f^{\mathrm{o}}$  is in the  $\gamma$ -smooth function class.

# 5.1 APPROXIMATION ERROR ANALYSIS BY FULLY CONNECTED NEURAL NETWORKS

Here, we present the approximation error analysis of FNNs for a general smoothness  $\gamma$  not restricted to the mixed/anisotropic smoothness. For a given  $T > 0$  and the smoothness  $\gamma : \mathbb{N}_0^\infty \to \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ , define

$$
I (T, \gamma) := \left\{i \in \mathbb {N}: \exists s \in \mathbb {N} _ {0} ^ {\infty}, s _ {i} \neq 0, \gamma (s) <   T \right\},
$$

and then the following quantities play an important role in our approximation error analysis.

Definition 6 (Axial complexity and frequency direction complexity). The axial complexity is defined by  $d_{\max}(T,\gamma) \coloneqq |I(T,\gamma)|$ . Moreover, the frequency direction complexity is defined by  $f_{\max}(T,\gamma) \coloneqq \max_{s \in \mathbb{N}_0^\infty: \gamma(s) \leq T} \max_{i \in \mathbb{N}} s_i$ .

The axial complexity is used to evaluate how many components need to be extracted from a given infinite-dimensional sequence  $X \in \mathbb{R}^{\infty}$  to achieve a particular approximation error, and the frequency complexity characterizes up to which frequency we require to approximate a target function with a particular error. Let

$$
v := \left(\frac {1}{p} - \frac {1}{2}\right) _ {+}, \alpha (\gamma) := \sup  _ {s \in \mathbb {N} _ {0} ^ {\infty}} \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\infty} s _ {i}}{\gamma (s)}, G (T, \gamma) := \sum_ {s \in \mathbb {N} _ {0} ^ {\infty}: \gamma (s) <   T} 2 ^ {s},
$$

where  $(x)_{+} := \max \{x, 0\}$ . Then, a general approximation error theory for FNNs can be obtained as follows.

Theorem 7 (Approximation error for the  $\gamma$ -smooth space by FNNs). Assume that  $\gamma, \gamma': \mathbb{N}_0^\infty \to \mathbb{R}_{>0}$  satisfy

$$
\gamma^ {\prime} (s) <   \gamma (s), v \alpha (\gamma) <   1, v \alpha (\gamma^ {\prime}) <   1,
$$

and the target function  $f \in \mathcal{F}_{p,\theta}^{\gamma}$  ( $p \geq 1, \theta \geq 1$ ) to be approximated satisfies  $\| f \|_{\infty} \leq B_f$  for a constant  $B_f \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ . For arbitrary  $T > 0$ , we let a tuple  $(d_{\max}, f_{\max}, G)$  be

$$
(d _ {\max}, f _ {\max}, G) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} (d _ {\max } (\gamma), f _ {\max } (\gamma), G (T, \gamma)) & (1 \leq \theta \leq 2), \\ (d _ {\max } (\gamma^ {\prime}), f _ {\max } (\gamma^ {\prime}), G (T, \gamma^ {\prime})) & (2 <   \theta), \end{array} \right.
$$

and with some positive constants  $K$ ,  $K'$  depending only on  $B_f$ , we let

$$
L = 2 K \max  \left\{d _ {\max } ^ {2}, T ^ {2}, (\log G) ^ {2}, \log f _ {\max } \right\}, \quad W = 2 1 d _ {\max } G,
$$

$$
S = 1 7 6 4 K d _ {\max } ^ {2} \max  \left\{d _ {\max } ^ {2}, T ^ {2}, (\log G) ^ {2}, \log f _ {\max } \right\} G, \quad B = (\sqrt {2}) ^ {d _ {\max }} K ^ {\prime}.
$$

Then, there exists an FNN  $\hat{R}_T \in \Phi(L, W, S, B)$  with  $d_{\max}$ -dimensional input that takes  $(x_i)_{i \in I(T, \gamma)} \in [0, 1]^{d_{\max}}$  as an input such that  $f' : [0, 1]^{\infty} \to \mathbb{R}$  given by  $f'(X) := \hat{R}_T((x_i)_{i \in I(T, \gamma)})$  for  $X = (x_i)_{i=1}^{\infty} \in [0, 1]^{\infty}$  satisfies

$$
\| f - f ^ {\prime} \| _ {2} \lesssim \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 2 ^ {- (1 - v \alpha (\gamma)) T} \| f \| _ {\mathcal {F} _ {p, \theta} ^ {\gamma}} & (1 \leq \theta \leq 2), \\ 2 ^ {- (1 - v \alpha (\gamma^ {\prime})) T} \left(\sum_ {T \leq \gamma^ {\prime} (s)} 2 ^ {\frac {2 \theta}{\theta - 2} (\gamma^ {\prime} (s) - \gamma (s))}\right) ^ {1 / 2 - 1 / \theta} \| f \| _ {\mathcal {F} _ {p, \theta} ^ {\gamma}} & (2 <   \theta). \end{array} \right.
$$

According to this theorem, the derived approximation error can be achieved by FNNs if the required  $d_{\mathrm{max}}$  components of the input  $X$  is extracted. This theorem clarifies how the decay rate of the frequency components of the target function affects the approximation accuracy. Since the approximation accuracy is determined by  $(d_{\mathrm{max}},f_{\mathrm{max}},G)$ , it is not directly affected by the dimensionality but is characterized merely by the smoothness parameter  $\gamma$ . Intuitively,  $T > 0$  controls the approximation accuracy and simultaneously controls up to which frequency is used for the approximation. Specifically, the difficulty of the approximation is determined by the number of bases required that is characterized by the number of  $s\in \mathbb{N}_0^\infty$  with  $\gamma (s) < T$ , and the maximum frequency required for the approximation is also important for the analysis. The bound is proven by evaluating an approximation error of a trigonometric polynomial approximation of  $f\in \mathcal{F}_{p,\theta}^{\gamma}$  and showing that we can construct a neural network that approximates a trigonometric polynomial with a certain accuracy.

# 5.2 SMOOTHNESS WITH POLYNOMIAL ORDER INCREASE

Here, we derive a concrete convergence rate for CNNs in a setting where  $\gamma$  is mixed or anisotropic smoothness and the smoothness parameter  $a = (a_{i})_{i = 1}^{\infty}$  is polynomially increasing.

Assumption 8. There exists  $0 < q < \infty$  such that the smoothness parameter  $a = (a_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}$  satisfies  $a_i = \Omega(i^q)$ . We also assume  $a_1 < a_2$  for the mixed smoothness setting.

This assumption imposes that the target function should be sufficiently smoothness with respect to higher order indices. Under this setting, we show the approximation and estimation errors as follows. First, the approximation error by the CNNs can be evaluated as follows.

Theorem 9 (Approximation error bound under smoothness with polynomial order increase). Suppose that Assumptions 3 and 8 hold, then we have the following approximation error bounds:

1. Mixed smoothness  $(\gamma(s) = \langle a, s \rangle)$ : Suppose that  $v / a_1 < 1$ . Then, for arbitrary  $T > 0$ , there exists a configuration of the network structure,  $L' = 1$ ,  $B' = 1$ ,  $W' \sim T^{\frac{1}{q}}$ ,  $C' \sim T^{\frac{1}{q}}$  and

$$
L _ {1} (T) \sim \max \left\{T ^ {\frac {2}{q}}, T ^ {2} \right\}, W _ {1} (T) \sim \left(\prod_ {i = 2} ^ {\infty} \frac {1}{1 - 2 ^ {- \frac {(a _ {i} - a _ {1})}{a _ {1}}}}\right) T ^ {\frac {1}{q}} 2 ^ {\frac {T}{a _ {1}}},
$$

$$
S _ {1} (T) \sim \left(\prod_ {i = 2} ^ {\infty} \frac {1}{1 - 2 ^ {\frac {- (a _ {i} - a _ {1})}{a _ {1}}}}\right) T ^ {\frac {2}{q}} \max \left\{T ^ {\frac {2}{q}}, T ^ {2} \right\} 2 ^ {\frac {T}{a _ {1}}}, B _ {1} (T) \sim (\sqrt {2}) ^ {T ^ {\frac {1}{q}}},
$$

such that there exists an dilated CNN  $f' \in \mathcal{P}(L', B', W', C', L_1(T), W_1(T), S_1(T), B_1(T))$  satisfying the following approximation error:

$$
\left\| f ^ {\prime} - f ^ {\mathrm {o}} \right\| _ {2} \lesssim 2 ^ {- \left(1 - \frac {v}{a _ {1}}\right) T}.
$$

2. Anisotropic smoothness  $(\gamma(s) = \max_i \{a_i s_i\})$ : Let  $\tilde{a} := \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{a_i}$  and suppose  $\tilde{a} < \infty$  and  $v\tilde{a} < 1$ , then there exists a network structure setting  $L' = 1$ ,  $B' = 1$ ,  $W' \sim T^{\frac{1}{q}}$ ,  $C' \sim T^{\frac{1}{q}}$  and

$$
L _ {2} (T) \sim \max  \left\{T ^ {\frac {2}{q}}, T ^ {2} \right\}, W _ {2} (T) \sim T ^ {\frac {1}{q}} 2 ^ {\tilde {a} T}, S _ {2} (T) \sim T ^ {\frac {2}{q}} \max  \left\{T ^ {\frac {2}{q}}, T ^ {2} \right\} 2 ^ {\tilde {a} T}, B _ {2} (T) \sim (\sqrt {2}) ^ {T ^ {\frac {1}{q}}},
$$

such that there exists an dilated CNN  $f' \in \mathcal{P}(L', B', W', C', L_2(T), W_2(T), S_2(T), B_2(T))$  satisfying the following approximation error:

$$
\left\| f ^ {\prime} - f ^ {\mathrm {o}} \right\| _ {2} \lesssim 2 ^ {- (1 - v \tilde {a}) T}.
$$

The proof can be found in Appendix E. From this theorem, we can see that the number of layers, the width, the number of parameters, and the size of the parameters are both determined by  $T$  and the smoothness parameter  $a$ . Moreover, in Theorem 7, the approximation error was derived assuming that the appropriate index set  $I(T,\gamma)$  was provided. On the other hand, in Theorem 9, we do not make such an assumption because the CNNs can automatically extract the required index  $I(T,\gamma)$ .

Next, we consider the estimation error of these models in the regression problem (Eq. (1)). Suppose that we are given  $n$  observations  $D_{n} = (X_{i},y_{i})_{i = 1}^{n}$  following the model (1). We consider the empirical risk minimization estimator (ERM estimator) in the model  $\bar{\mathcal{P}}$  that is given by any minimizer of the empirical risk:

$$
\hat{f}\in \operatorname *{argmin}_{f\in \bar{\mathcal{P}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(f(X_{i}) - y_{i})^{2}.
$$

As we have stated above, we employ the mean squared error  $\| \hat{f} - f^{\mathrm{o}}\|_{P_X}^2$  as a performance measure. Since  $\hat{f}$  depends on the training data  $D_{n}$ , we take expectation with respect to  $D_{n}$ :  $\operatorname{E}_{P^{n}}[\| \hat{f} - f^{\mathrm{o}}\|_{P_{X}}^{2}] := \operatorname{E}_{(X_{i},y_{i})_{i = 1}^{n}} \sim P^{n}[\| \hat{f} - f^{\mathrm{o}}\|_{P_{X}}^{2}]$ . Then, the following theorem holds.

Theorem 10 (Estimation error under smoothness with polynomial order increase). Suppose that Assumptions 3 and 8 hold, then we have the following estimation error bounds:

1. Mixed smoothness  $(\gamma(s) = \langle a, s \rangle)$ : If  $v / a_1 < 1$ , then by setting the network structure as  $L' = 1$ ,  $B' = 1$ ,  $W' \sim (\log n)^{\frac{1}{q}}$ ,  $C' \sim (\log n)^{\frac{1}{q}}$  and  $(L, W, S, B) = (L_1(T), W_1(T), S_1(T), B_1(T))$  for  $T = \frac{a_1}{2(a_1 - v) + 1} \log_2(n)$ , the ERM estimator  $\hat{f}$  in  $\bar{\mathcal{P}}(B_f, L', B', W', C', L, W, S, B)$  achieves

$$
\mathrm {E} _ {P ^ {n}} \left[ \| \hat {f} - f ^ {\circ} \| _ {P _ {X}} ^ {2} \right] \lesssim \left(\prod_ {i = 2} ^ {\infty} \frac {1}{1 - 2 ^ {- \frac {(a _ {i} - a _ {1})}{a _ {1}}}}\right) n ^ {- \frac {2 (a _ {1} - v)}{2 (a _ {1} - v) + 1}} (\log n) ^ {\frac {2}{q} + 2} \max  \left\{\left(\log n\right) ^ {\frac {4}{q}}, \left(\log n\right) ^ {4} \right\}.
$$

2. Anisotropic smoothness  $(\gamma(s) = \max_i \{a_i s_i\})$ : Under the same setting, if  $v\tilde{a} < 1$ , by setting the network structure as  $L' = 1$ ,  $B' = 1$ ,  $W' \sim (\log n)^{\frac{1}{q}}$ ,  $C' \sim (\log n)^{\frac{1}{q}}$  and  $(L, W, S, B) = (L_2(T), W_2(T), S_2(T), B_2(T))$  for  $T = \frac{1/\tilde{a}}{2(1/\tilde{a} - v) + 1} \log_2(n)$ , the ERM estimator  $\hat{f}$  in  $\bar{\mathcal{P}}(B_f, L', B', W', C', L, W, S, B)$  achieves

$$
\operatorname {E} _ {P ^ {n}} \left[ \| \hat {f} - f ^ {\circ} \| _ {P _ {X}} ^ {2} \right] \lesssim n ^ {- \frac {2 (\frac {1}{a} - v)}{2 (\frac {1}{a} - v) + 1}} (\log n) ^ {\frac {2}{q} + 2} \max  \left\{\left(\log n\right) ^ {\frac {4}{q}}, (\log n) ^ {4} \right\}.
$$

The proof can be found in Appendix F. This theorem shows that even if the dimension of the input data is infinite, for a function with a particular smoothness, CNNs can achieve a dimension-independent convergence rate which is a polynomial order, that is, it can avoid the curse of dimensionality by utilizing the increasing smoothness. We can see that the derived convergence rate is a direct extension of finite dimensional one. Actually, if  $v = 0$ , the rate for the anisotropic smoothness matches that of the finite dimensional one Suzuki & Nitanda (2021) up to poly-log order which is known as minimax optimal. Therefore, CNNs can achieve the optimal rate up to poly-log order at least when  $v = 0$ . As fro the mixed smoothness, a finite dimensional version was analyzed Suzuki (2019) and a similar rate was derived. However, our analysis assumes  $a_1 < a_2$  and  $a_i = \Omega(i^q)$  and thus obtained completely dimensionality independent bound while the bound by Suzuki (2019) depends on  $d$  in the exponent of the poly-log order.

# 5.3 SMOOTHNESS WITH SPARSITY

Next, we relax the assumption  $a_{i} = \Omega (i^{q})$  and consider a situation where there is a kind of sparse structure in  $a$ . As we have seen in the previous section, under the assumption that the coordinates with large indices are not important, polynomial-order convergence rate depending only on the smoothness can be achieved by the ordinary CNNs. In this section, we show that similar rates can be achieved by using dilated CNNs even when  $a$  does not satisfy the polynomial order increase if  $a$  has sparsity. For that purpose, we first define the sparsity of the smoothness.

Definition 11 (Weak  $\ell^q$ -norm of smoothness). Given  $a = (a_i)_{i=1}^\infty \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}^\infty$  which is not necessarily monotonically increasing, consider the sorted sequence  $0 < a_{i_1} \leq a_{i_2} \leq \dots$  in the ascending order. Then, define its weak  $\ell^q$ -norm for  $0 < q < \infty$  as  $\|a\|_{wl^q} := \sup_j j^q a_{i_j}^{-1}$ .

This kind of sparsity inducing norm were introduced and discussed previously in Donoho (1993); Donoho et al. (1996); Yang & Barron (1999) to quantify sparsity of coefficients of basis expansions. We notice that, if  $\| a\|_{wl^q}$  is small, almost all  $a_i$ s are very large and there are only few indices that are small, which means sparseness. If the smoothness parameter  $a$  has a small weak  $\ell^q$ -norm, then we can say that the functions with such smoothness has a small number of important coordinate directions. Therefore, it is expected that we can approximate such a function efficiently by a neural network. In this section, we analyze the approximation and estimation errors under the condition of sparse smoothness.

Assumption 12.  $a = (a_{i})_{i = 1}^{\infty}$  satisfies  $\| a\|_{wl^q}\leq 1$  for  $0 < q < \infty$  and  $a_{i} = \Omega (\log i)$ .

Note that this assumption relaxes the condition  $a_{i} = \Omega (i^{q})$  in Assumption 8 to  $a_{i} = \Omega (\log i)$ . Instead, it imposes the sparsity  $\| a\|_{wl^q}\leq 1$ . Under this assumption, we obtain the following approximation error bound.

Theorem 13 (Approximation error bound for sparse smoothness). Suppose that Assumptions 3 and 12 hold, then we have the following approximation error bounds for any  $T > 1$ :

1. Mixed smoothness  $(\gamma(s) = \langle a, s \rangle)$ : Suppose that  $v / a_{i_1} < 1$ , then there exist a set of network structure parameters satisfying

$$
L ^ {\prime} \sim T, B ^ {\prime} = 1, W ^ {\prime} = 3, C ^ {\prime} \sim T ^ {\frac {1}{q}},
$$

such that there exists an dilated CNN  $f' \in \mathcal{P}(L', B', W', C', L_1(T), W_1(T), S_1(T), B_1(T))$  satisfying  $\| f' - f^{\mathrm{o}} \|_2 \lesssim 2^{-(1 - \frac{1}{a_{i_1}})^T}$ .

2. Anisotropic smoothness  $(\gamma(s) = \max_{i}\{a_{i}s_{i}\}_{i})$ : Suppose that  $\tilde{a} < \infty$  and  $v\tilde{a} < 1$ , then there exist a set of network structure parameters satisfying  $L' \sim T$ ,  $B' \sim 1$ ,  $W' = 3$ ,  $C' \sim T^{\frac{1}{q}}$  such that there exists an dilated CNN  $f' \in \mathcal{P}(L', B', W', C', L_{2}(T), W_{2}(T), S_{2}(T), B_{2}(T))$  satisfying  $\| f' - f^{\mathrm{o}} \|_2 \lesssim 2^{-(1 - v\tilde{a})T}$ .

We can see that this approximation error bound gives the same bound as Theorem 9 under a relaxed condition Assumption 12 with sparse smoothness. The only difference is the setting of the convolution part  $(L', W', C)$  and other parts are same as Theorem 9. This difference is required to find the important indices that are relatively non-smooth compared with other indices. Thanks to the structure of dilated convolution, it can find such indices from a long range of index set:  $\{i \in \mathbb{N} : i = O(3^{L'})\}$ . Accordingly, we also have the following estimation error bound.

Theorem 14 (Estimation error for sparse smoothness). Suppose that Assumptions 3 and 12 hold, then by setting  $L' \sim \log n$ ,  $B' \sim 1$ ,  $W' = 3$ ,  $C' \sim (\log n)^{\frac{1}{q}}$  and  $(L, W, S, B)$  as in Theorem 10, the ERM estimator  $\hat{f}$  in the class of dilated CNNs can achieve the same convergence rate of the estimation error as Theorem 10.

The proof can be found in Appendix G. These theorems show that for polynomially increasing smoothness, ordinary CNNs can perform optimal coordinate selection, while for sparse smoothness, dilated CNNs play an important role in coordinate selection. This theorem shows that, when extracting data with long-term dependence, learning rates that avoid dependence on dimensionality can be achieved by using dilated CNNs.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this study, we gave a condition on the smoothness of the function space as one of the situations in which the curse of dimensionality can be avoided when the input is ultra-high dimensional ( $n \ll d$ ) or infinite dimensional ( $d = \infty$ ). This study showed that the smoothness of the target function plays an essential role in characterizing the estimation error bound. Especially, when the smoothness parameter  $(a_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}$  grows up as the index  $i$  increases, we can obtain a polynomial order convergence rate even if the input is infinite dimensional. Future plans include, for example, considering a situation where the smoothness depends on each input location, and extending the definition of  $\mathcal{F}_{p,\theta}^{\gamma}$  so that it captures more realistic situations.
