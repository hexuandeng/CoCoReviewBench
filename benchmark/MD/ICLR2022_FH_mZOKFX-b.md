# ABSTRACT

Generalization measures are intensively studied in the machine learning community for better modeling generalization gaps. However, establishing a reliable generalization measure for statistical singular models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) is challenging due to the complex nature of the singular models. We focus on a classical measure called Takeuchi's Information Criteria (TIC) to investigate allowed conditions in which the criteria can well explain generalization gaps caused by DNNs. In fact, theory indicates the applicability of TIC near the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. Experimentally, we trained more than 5,000 DNN models with 12 DNN architectures including large models (e.g., VGG16) and 4 datasets, and estimated corresponding TICs in order to comprehensively study the relationship between the generalization gap and the TIC estimates. We examine several approximation methods to estimate TIC with feasible computational load and investigate the accuracy trade-off. Experimental results indicate that estimated TIC well correlates generalization gaps under the conditions that are close to NTK regime. Outside the NTK regime, such correlation disappears, shown theoretically and empirically. We further demonstrate that TIC can yield better trial pruning ability for hyperparameter optimization over existing methods.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been exhibiting great generalization abilities in many applications, but the mechanism of the generalization has not been fully understood yet (Neyshabur et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016; Recht et al., 2019). Establishing a reliable generalization measure is an important research topic for generating a good model from limited data resources, including an application of hyperparameter search. Many attempts (Arora et al., 2018; Wei & Ma, 2019; Neyshabur et al., 2018) have been taken to better understand the generalization phenomenon in deep learning models from theoretical points of view. From empirical points of view, there have been intensive studies (Keskar et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2019; Bartlett et al., 2017) in search of learning conditions that likely yield high model performance.

Work by (Jiang et al., 2019) indicated that a measure that includes both Hessian  $H(\theta)$  and covariance  $C(\theta)$  defined from the loss and the network parameters  $\theta$  near a local minimum may potentially show good correlation with generalization performance. Another study indicated that use of only a single measure, either Hessian  $H(\theta)$  or covariance  $C(\theta)$ , fails to capture the generalization performance (Novak et al., 2018a).

Generalization gap inherently stems from a discrepancy between the empirical and the true data distribution. A minimizer of the empirical loss will be affected by the noise due to a finite number of samples and by the form of the loss landscape near the minimum. The former can be characterized as noise  $(C(\theta))$  and the latter as curvature  $(H(\theta))$ .

Taking these findings into account, we sought to model generalization gap, then found that a classical information criterion called Takeuchi's Information Criteria (TIC) (Takeuchi, 1976) expresses generalization gap in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. TIC has the following form

$$
\underbrace {\operatorname {T I C} (\boldsymbol {\theta})} _ {\text {I n f o r m a t i o n C r i t e r i a}} = - \underbrace {\mathbb {E} _ {\hat {p}} [ l (y , f (x , \boldsymbol {\theta})) ]} _ {\text {M e a n E m p i r i c a l E r r o r}} + \underbrace {\operatorname {T r} \left(\boldsymbol {H} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) ^ {- 1} \boldsymbol {C} (\boldsymbol {\theta})\right)} _ {\text {E s t i m a t e d B i a s T e r m}}, \tag {1}
$$

where  $f$  is a smooth function over  $\pmb{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  with input  $x$  and target  $y$ , and  $l$  is the negative log-likelihood, also denoted as loss function. The first term on the right-hand side is the log-likelihood, which takes the expectation over an empirical data distribution  $(x_i, y_i) \sim \hat{p}$ . For the later discussion, we use  $\hat{\pmb{\theta}}$  as the solution of the empirical loss; i.e.,  $\hat{\pmb{\theta}} = \arg \min_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{\hat{p}}[l(y, f(x, \pmb{\theta}))]$ , and  $\pmb{\theta}^*$  as the parameters that maximizes the likelihood with respect to the true data distribution  $(x, y) \sim p$ ; i.e.,  $\pmb{\theta}^* = \arg \min_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_p[l(y, f(x, \pmb{\theta}))]$ .

For a DNN of practical size, exact computations of the matrices  $H(\theta)$ ,  $C(\theta)$  are nearly infeasible due to large dimensionality. To make the computation feasible, we adopted a strategy of using shared components of the matrix to estimate TIC with less computations, based on a relationship among matrices such as  $H(\theta)$ ,  $C(\theta)$ , and Fisher Information Matrix  $F(\theta)$ . To further reduce the computational costs for the bias term, we examined methods using approximations and lower bounds so that TIC estimations for DNNs of practical sizes are feasible.

In this work, we make the following contributions:

- We provide empirical and theoretical evidences that TIC is highly correlated with generalization gap of DNNs that are close to NTK regime, despite the fact that TIC is not originally designed for singular model such as general DNNs.  
- We conduct comprehensive experiments in which more than 5,000 models, including ones close to NTK regime, with totally 12 architectures, 4 datasets and 15 training settings are trained, and corresponding TICs are estimated with approximation techniques, to clarify conditions that TIC can well explain generalization gaps.  
- We use TIC as a threshold for pruning poorly performing trial models during hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and show that it can successfully prevent promising candidates from being pruned prematurely.

# 2 GENERALIZATION MEASURES

Generalization measures measure the generalization ability of statistical models. Typically, the generalization gap, which is defined as the difference between training loss and validation loss, is used to quantify the generalization ability.

# 2.1 WHICH GENERALIZATION MEASURE IS PROSPECTIVE?

To answer this question, before demonstrating the effectiveness of TIC, we highlight the development of research in this area and the motivation behind this work. For understanding generalization behavior, there are two major approaches by quantifying generalization bounds and complexity measures.

Approach of quantifying generalization bounds is pursued by theoretical groups to prove the bound of the generalization gap (Dziugaite & Roy, 2017). Although tight bounds can be proven, they are often based on assumptions that do not apply to practical DNN settings. In addition, no bounds have been shown to describe the performance of the current DNNs to a satisfactory level.

On the other hand, approach of quantifying complexity measures, which do not necessarily certify bounds, follows the principle of Occam's razor and evaluates the complexity of the model. Theoretically motivated complexity measures, including VC-dimension (Vapnik & Chervonenkis, 2015), PAC-Bayesian framework (McAllester, 1999), the norm of parameters (Neyshabur et al., 2015), are often discussed as significant components of generalization bounds, and a monotonic relationship between complexity measures and generalizations is mathematically established. In contrast, empirically motivated generalization measures, such as sharpness (Keskar et al., 2016), are justified by experiments and observations. In particular, for DNNs, Jiang et al. (2019) have conducted exhaustive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of generalization measures for three groups: norm-based measure, sharpness-based measure, and noise-based measure.

- Norm-based measure:  $|\theta|$ . Most of the proposed norm-based measures are based on the Fisher-Rao Metric (Liang et al., 2019), which does not capture generalization well. In particular, it has

been reported that spectral complexity such as product of spectral norms of the layers (Bartlett et al., 2017) has a strong negative correlation with generalization. It is impossible to explain the success of DNN models with huge parameter sizes in recent years with these metrics.

- Sharpness-based measure:  $H(\theta)$ . Sharpness-based metrics, such as sharp minima and flat minima (Keskar et al., 2016) and PAC-Bayesian framework (McAllester, 1999), are not only associated with intuitive understanding but also empirically show a strong correlation with the generalization gap. However, some model architectures are known to show poor correlation (Dinh et al., 2017).  
- Noise-based measure:  $C(\theta)$ . Experimental results show that generalization measure based on gradient has potential (Jiang et al., 2019). In particular, in their experiments, they observe that the variance of the gradient captures Sharpness, but they suggest that this is not a good generalization measure depending on the architecture of the model.

These results suggest that studying generalization measures that can be estimated using  $H(\theta)$  and  $C(\theta)$  is prospective. However, since the combination of  $H(\theta)$  and  $C(\theta)$  seen in TIC is not feasible to compute for practical DNN settings, so it was outside the scope of (Jiang et al., 2019).

# 2.2 INFORMATION MATRIX: ELEMENTS OF GENERALIZATION MEASURES

Previous research has highlighted information matrices such as  $H(\theta)$  and  $C(\theta)$  in generalization measures in DNNs. Thomas et al. (2019); Kunstner et al. (2019) remarked that these matrices are often confused and misused, for example in the field of optimization, leading to wrong conclusions, even though these matrices play an essential role in the study of DNNs, especially in optimization (Amari et al., 2020; Martens & Grosse, 2015a), understanding implicit regularization in SGD (Wen et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019), and Bayesian inference (Zhang et al., 2018). Before discussing these generalization measures, it should be made clear how each of the information matrices are defined.

In this paper, uncentered gradient covariance matrix is denoted as  $C(\theta)$ . We define  $q_{\theta}$  as a model distribution. Furthermore, we employ the data distributions  $\hat{p}$  and  $p$  introduced in the previous section as the empirical and true data distributions respectively. Matrices  $H(\theta)$ ,  $C(\theta)$  and  $F(\theta)$  are then defined as:

$$
\boldsymbol {H} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) = \mathbb {E} _ {p} \left[ \frac {\partial^ {2} l (y , f (x , \boldsymbol {\theta}))}{\partial \boldsymbol {\theta} \partial \boldsymbol {\theta} ^ {T}} \right] \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d \times d},
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {C} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) = \mathbb {E} _ {p} \left[ \frac {\partial l (y , f (x , \boldsymbol {\theta}))}{\partial \boldsymbol {\theta}} \frac {\partial l (y , f (x , \boldsymbol {\theta}))}{\partial \boldsymbol {\theta} ^ {T}} \right] \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d \times d}, \tag {2}
$$

$$
\pmb {F} (\pmb {\theta}) = \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\pmb {\theta}}} \left[ \frac {\partial l (y , f (x , \pmb {\theta}))}{\partial \pmb {\theta}} \frac {\partial l (y , f (x , \pmb {\theta}))}{\partial \pmb {\theta} ^ {T}} \right] \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d \times d}
$$

The conditions under which these matrices are equal will be discussed in detail in section 3.1. The relation between  $C(\theta)$  and  $F(\theta)$  is often misunderstood because they both involve the outer product of the gradients but they a different different distribution when computing the expectation.

As a subsequent study, Novak et al. (2018a) concluded that consideration of either  $H(\theta)$  or  $C(\theta)$  alone is insufficient to estimate the generalization of DNNs and that both are essential. In particular,  $H(\theta)$  is a value that does not depend on the distribution of input data; however, as the generalization ability depends on the distribution of the data, it is also natural to consider  $C(\theta)$ , which is related to noise in the gradient. Furthermore, as supporting evidence of Novak et al. (2018a)'s claim, Thomas et al. (2019) showed empirically the effectiveness of TIC, a generalization measure that considers both  $H(\theta)$  and  $C(\theta)$  expressed by the equation 1. However, Thomas et al. (2019)'s work only experimented with very small-scale NNs because it is challenging to calculate TIC with DNNs of practical size. As a matter of fact, even the ResNet-8 model used in the small-scale image classification benchmark CIFAR10 is not feasible, as it requires nearly 200TB of memory to calculate the TIC exactly.

Remark 2.1. It should also be noted that TIC is an information criterion for regular models, not for singular models such as DNNs, and its theoretical justification in the domain of DNNs is not clear.

# 2.3 TIC IS DERIVED AS GENERALIZATION GAP IN NTK REGIME

This section outlines the derivation of the definition of TIC in equation 1, considering the generalization gap of DNNs in the framework of NTK's regime. We employ the setting introduced in section 1,  $f$  is a smooth function over  $\pmb{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , a parameter of the statistical model. First, we further assume that the following holds for  $f$  and  $\pmb{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  in the NTK regime.

# Assumption 2.1.

(A1) Global convergence: the model has only one possible solution. However, it is not required to be  $q_{\theta} = p$  (allowing for misspecified situation).  
(A2) Asymptotic normality: the maximum likelihood estimator  $\hat{\theta}$  from the empirical data distribution  $\hat{p}$  and the maximum likelihood estimator  $\theta^{*}$  in the true data distribution  $p$  satisfy asymptotic normality.

# Proposition 2.1 (Generalization Gap in NTK Regime is equal to TIC).

Under the assumptions (A1) and (A2), the estimated bias  $b$  (i.e. generalization gap) when evaluating using empirical data distribution  $\hat{p}$  would then be as follows.

$$
\begin{array}{l} b = \mathbb {E} _ {p} \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {\hat {p}} [ l (\boldsymbol {y}, f (\boldsymbol {x}, \hat {\boldsymbol {\theta}})) ] - \mathbb {E} _ {p} [ l (\boldsymbol {y}, f (\boldsymbol {x}, \hat {\boldsymbol {\theta}})) ] \right] \tag {3} \\ = \operatorname {T r} \left(\boldsymbol {H} _ {p} \left(\boldsymbol {\theta} ^ {*}\right) ^ {- 1} \boldsymbol {C} _ {p} \left(\boldsymbol {\theta} ^ {*}\right)\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

Where  $H_{p}(\theta^{*})$  and  $C_p(\theta^*)$  are the Hessian and Covariance respectively with regards to  $\theta^{*}$  over true data distribution  $p$ . However, as the true data distribution  $p$  and parameter  $\theta^{*}$  which maximizes the likelihood for that data distribution are unknown, the expected value in the empirical data distribution  $\hat{p}$  and parameter  $\hat{\theta}$  are generally used as a consistent estimator, which is consistent with the TIC. A more detailed proof is given in Appendix A.1.

Remark 2.2. The bias term of TIC is formulated as  $\mathrm{Tr}\left(H(\pmb{\theta})^{-1}C(\pmb{\theta})\right)$ . However, since there is no guarantee that  $H(\pmb{\theta})$  is positive definite in practice. To prevent this problem, the addition of a small identity matrix, called damping, is performed as  $\tilde{H} (\pmb {\theta})^{-1} = (H(\pmb {\theta}) + \lambda I)^{-1}$ . Alternatively, consider the case where the TIC is calculated by approximation with a matrix of only the diagonal components of the respective matrices, as  $\mathrm{Tr}\left(H(\pmb {\theta})^{-1}C(\pmb {\theta})\right)\approx \mathrm{Tr}\left(H_{\mathrm{diag}}(\pmb {\theta})^{-1}C_{\mathrm{diag}}(\pmb {\theta})\right)$  In this case, the following lower bound is given for the diagonal approximated TIC.

$$
\operatorname {T r} \left(\boldsymbol {H} _ {\mathrm {d i a g}} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) ^ {- 1} \boldsymbol {C} _ {\mathrm {d i a g}} (\boldsymbol {\theta})\right) > \frac {\operatorname {T r} \left(\boldsymbol {C} _ {\mathrm {d i a g}} (\boldsymbol {\theta})\right)}{\operatorname {T r} \left(\boldsymbol {H} _ {\mathrm {d i a g}} (\boldsymbol {\theta})\right)} = \frac {\operatorname {T r} \left(\boldsymbol {C} (\boldsymbol {\theta})\right)}{\operatorname {T r} \left(\boldsymbol {H} (\boldsymbol {\theta})\right)} \tag {4}
$$

Remark 2.3. We note that not all DNNs are in the NTK regime. One indicator of whether a DNN is in the NTK regime is the ratio of the number of model parameters to the number of data. In general, unconstrained DNNs are singular models, so WAIC (Watanabe, 2013) is appropriate instead of TIC or AIC (Akaike, 1998), but computational cost of WAIC is way too high to perform a wide range of learning experiments. Furthermore, when the loss function includes a regularization term, GIC is technically appropriate instead of TIC, but it has a disadvantage that the calculation is further complicated.

# 3 APPROXIMATION OF TIC

# 3.1 HESSIAN, GENERALIZED GAUSS-NEWTON MATRIX (GGN) AND FIM

In this section, we describe the conditions for which the Hessian, GGN, and FIM become equivalent. This equivalence can be exploited to reduce the computational cost of computing the TIC. TIC requires the computation of  $H(\theta)$  and  $C(\theta)$ , but the computational cost of  $H(\theta)$  is relatively high. For NNs that consist of linear, convolutional, and pooling layers, along with piecewise linear activations, the Hessian is equal to the GGN (Schraudolph, 2002). This actually holds true for most CNNs used in practice. The GGN is an extension of the Gauss-Newton matrix  $\tilde{G}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_p[(J_\theta)^T J_\theta]$ .

$$
\boldsymbol {G} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) = \mathbb {E} _ {p} \left[ \left(\boldsymbol {J} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}}\right) ^ {T} \boldsymbol {H} _ {f} \boldsymbol {J} _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \right] \tag {5}
$$

Where  $H_{f}$  is the Hessian of  $l(y, f(x, \theta))$  and  $J_{\theta}$  is Jacobian of  $f(x, \theta)$  with respect to  $\theta$ . Furthermore, the GGN is equal to the FIM for any NN that uses the softmax cross entropy. Therefore, we can assume the following for most practical DNN problem settings.

# Assumption 3.1.

(B1) Loss function:  $l$  is the softmax cross-entropy function  
(B2) Activation function: inside  $f$ , all activation functions' second derivative are always zero, such as ReLU or the identity function.

# Proposition 3.1 ( $H(\theta)$  is equal to  $F(\theta)$  through GGN).

Under the assumption of (B1) and (B2),  $H(\theta)$  and  $F(\theta)$  are exactly equal through GGN. They are also guaranteed to be positive semi-definite.

$$
\boldsymbol {H} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) = \boldsymbol {G} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) = \boldsymbol {F} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) \tag {6}
$$

A more detailed proof is given in Martens (2020).

# 3.2 APPROXIMATION OF MATRICES AND TRACE ESTIMATION

As noted in section 2.2, information matrices are in demand for many applications, including TIC. However, for a model with a large number of parameters  $d$  such as a DNN, it is necessary to compute a matrix with size of  $d^2$ . For this reason, approximation methods ranging from approximating the information matrix itself (Le Roux et al., 2007) to approximating the product of the information matrix, and the vector directly is used in optimization (Pearlmutter, 1994) and other applications. We propose the following approximation method to calculate the TIC and experimentally verify the trade-off between accuracy and computation time.

- Replacing  $H(\theta)$  in  $F(\theta)$  and fast estimation of  $F(\theta)$  in Monte-Carlo sampling. As shown in equation 6,  $F(\theta)$  can be used in place of  $H(\theta)$  under the (B1) and (B2) assumption. We use this property to speed up the calculation by simultaneously computing  $C(\theta)$  and  $F(\theta)$ , which have a common term. Furthermore, since the number of classes for the classification task is 10 in MNIST and 100 in CIFAR100, the computational cost of  $F(\theta)$  is huge, so we approximate  $F(\theta)$  using  $F_{\mathrm{mmc}}(\theta)$ , which is a Monte Carlo approximation. Martens & Grosse (2015b) use  $m = 1$  in the practical setting. We follow this setting  $F_{\mathrm{lmc}}(\theta)$  for the approximation of  $F(\theta)$ .  
- Block-diagonalization and diagonalization. In NTK's Regime, the correlation between layers is ignored, so block-diagonalization is a reasonable approximation method. The computational complexity can be reduced from  $O(d^{3})$  to  $O(d_{l}^{3})^{1}$  by the block-diagonal approximation. Diagonalization is a simple approximation; it ignores the correlation between DNN units. It has been reported to be sufficient for some applications (Singh & Alistarh, 2020). It can also be calculated as a sum-of-products operation on vectors rather than matrices, significantly reducing computational complexity and memory consumption. In particular, by using the diagonal approximation, the inverse calculation of  $\pmb{H}(\pmb{\theta})$  can be reduced from  $O(d^{3})$  to the order of  $O(d)$ .  
- Lower bound of diagonalization. As shown in equation 4, by giving the lower bound of the diagonal approximation, it is possible to calculate the trace of each matrix by calculating and dividing the trace of each matrix without calculating the diagonal component of the matrix. In other words, it is possible to calculate without considering whether  $F(\theta)$  is positive definite.  
- Hutchinson's method for estimate  $\operatorname{Tr}(H(\theta))$  in fast. Furthermore, rather than approximating the matrix itself, we will introduce a method to accelerate the computation of its eigenvalues and trace. For optimization in deep learning, it is enough to calculate not the Hessian itself but the product of the Hessian and an arbitrary vector (Hessian vector product; Hvp). In order to compute Hvp exactly, Pearlmutter (1994) proposed a fast algorithm to compute Hvp in NNs during backpropagation. This Hvp can be applied to non-optimization applications, such as approximating  $\operatorname{Tr}(H(\theta))$  (Avron & Toledo, 2011). Hutchinson's method (Hutchinson, 1989) approximates the expectation value of the quadratic form of the Hessian and the Rademacher random vector (each element takes 1 or  $-1$  with probability  $1/2$ ).

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

# 4.1 OVERVIEW

The goal of our paper is to elucidate the correlation between the TIC estimates and the generalization gap. To make our study of TIC as comprehensive as possible, we trained on 4 different data sets and 12 different DNN models. Using these combinations, we searched for hyperparameters for each of the 15 problem settings and evaluated the parameters of the trained models. By comparing these results, we can observe how the effectiveness of TIC changes with the model and problem settings. In our experiments, the bias term of TIC is estimated by using validation data, and the generalization gap is the absolute value of the difference in loss between training and test data, using all of the data in each dataset, not just a part of the data. The problem settings for the experiment can be divided into two main categories along with dataset and model size as table 1.

Table 1: 2 Categories of experimental settings. Problem settings with  $\sharp$  and  $\star$  indicate to use linear neural network and to be considered almost in NTK regime respectively. For hyperparameter search, we conduct Bayesian optimization for all experimental settings. We describe the further detailed configurations of hyperparameters and other settings for the experiment in Appendix C.2. The remaining experimental settings are explained in Appendix C.

In particular, ResNet-8, which is commonly used as a benchmark for training CIFAR10, requires over 200TB of memory to compute exact  $H(\theta)$ . Even state-of-the-art GPU NVIDIA A100 is impractical since it has only 80 GB of device memory. Hence, as small-scale experiment, we use a small dataset called TinyMNIST to limit the size of the DNN model, which is a resized version of the MNIST image, which reduces the dimension of the input layer of DNN, to compare our approximation method and exact calculation. As practical-scale experiments, we evaluated the real-world datasets and DNN models. We used diagonal approximations and their lower bound approximations to estimate TIC.

# 4.2 SMALL SCALE EXPERIMENTS: COMPARING APPROXIMATION AND EXACT

As small-scale experiments, we trained Tiny MNIST on 5 experimental settings: 3-LNNs and NNs, each w/ and w/o SC, and a wide model, 2-NNs without SC. Afterwards, we evaluated the approximation of  $\operatorname{Tr}\left(H(\pmb{\theta})^{-1}C(\pmb{\theta})\right)$ , the bias term of TIC, for  $H(\pmb{\theta})$  and  $C(\pmb{\theta})$ , using block-diagonal

Pearson's Coefficient vs  $d / n$  Ratio  
Figure 3: Relationship between Pearson's Correlation (generalization gap and TIC estimates), and  $d / n$ . It should be noted that the correlation between the TIC estimates and the generalization gap is high in regions with large  $d / n$ , which are considered to be close to the NTK regime. All full results of its value and other metric's Spearman's Correlation and Kendall's  $\tau$  Coefficient result including are shown in Appendix D.

approximation, diagonal approximation, and its lower bound. Furthermore, as mentioned in equation 6, for the purpose of speeding up the process, we also estimate TIC using  $F(\theta)$ , which shares the same elements to be calculated as  $C(\theta)$  as an alternative.

Remark 4.1. It should be noted that the above five settings are different from the situation of NTK, since  $d \ll p$ . However, we observed that the estimation of TIC was effective for LNNs.

First, we show the results of our experiments on the quality of the approximations. In general, from the exact computation to the block-diagonal approximation, i.e., the approximation which ignores the correlation between layers, we can confirm that the value and the rank correlation are kept. As for the LNN, the rank correlation is maintained for the block-diagonal approximation, the diagonal approximation, and its lower bound, though the value fluctuates. On the other hand, in the case of NN w/ SC, we confirmed that the rank correlation is maintained between exact and block-diagonal approximation, between diagonal approximation and its lower bound. These results show that LNN or NN with more layers and SC has a trend of the higher approximation quality.

Then we explain the correlation between the TIC estimates and the generalization gap. We observed that LNN is in the effective regime of TIC and has a high correlation with the generalization gap in all approximations. For NNs, similarly high correlations were observed for the models w/ SC. For the 3-NN w/o SC, the results were such that the inverse correlation was observed even in the exact case. In the case of 2-NN, the approximate correlation was also collapsed, resulting in no correlation with the generalization gap.

From these results, we conclude that the performance of TIC on the correlation with the generalization gap is higher for NN models with more layers and SC, and the correlation does not change significantly before and after the approximation.

# 4.3 PRACTICAL SCALE EXPERIMENTS: CORRELATION TO GENERALIZATION GAP AND TIC LOWER BOUND, TIC WITH DIAGONAL APPROXIMATION

As practical-scale experiments, we experimented with the problems where  $d \gg p$ , which is considered to be NTK's Regime. Contrary to small-scale experiments, we used MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets to evaluate practical settings.

First, we show the case of MNIST. The settings of LNN show a strong correlation with the generalization gap in the lower bound approximation as well as in the small-scale experiment. In the case of the NN model, a strong correlation with the generalization gap is observed, unlike in the small-scale setting. Furthermore, in the case of NN and LNN w/ SC, it has less variance and shows a stronger correlation with the generalization gap. In the Simple CNN case, the correlation with the generalization gap is weaker than in previous cases but still shows a correlation. Also, there is no correlation with the generalization gap in the case of the value of  $\operatorname{Tr}(H(\theta))$ ,  $\operatorname{Tr}(F(\theta))$ ,  $\operatorname{Tr}(C(\theta))$  itself respectively. Detailed experimental results are shown in figure 12 in the Appendix D.3.

In the cases of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, both the measures using lower bound and the diagonal approximation show a high correlation with the generalization gap. For LNNs, the correlation is more linear in the case w/ SC. For VGG16 and ResNet8, the correlation is not as good as for LNN, but we confirmed the effectiveness of TIC in NTK's regime. Furthermore, no correlation was found between the generalization gap and trace itself, respectively, as well as previous case. These trace values have different patterns depending on the network, and it was found that these single factor alone is insufficient for estimating the generalization gap.

Remark 4.2. It should be noted that TIC estimates captured the trend of the generalization gap in the training process as shown in figure 4.

# 4.4 CALCULATION RUNTIME MEASUREMENT EXPERIMENTS

Our runtime measurement experiments were run on NVIDIA Tesla V100 16GB GPUs, with an average of 10 trials each. Significant speedup was achieved by approximating the shape of the matrix, replacing  $H(\theta)$  by  $F(\theta)$ , and Monte Carlo estimation of  $F(\theta)$ , as shown in 3. Even in the case of a small-scale problem setting, the diagonal approximation with  $F(\theta)$  and  $C(\theta)$  is 50 times faster than that with exact while maintaining the rank correlation with  $H(\theta)$  and  $C(\theta)$ . However, since the number of parameters in the small problem setting is at most 720, and VGG16 has 186,530 times as many parameters, the effect of increasing the computational order from  $O(d^3)$  to  $O(d)$  is more significant in the large-scale problem setting. The full details are shown in Appendix D.4. Notably, this speedup by using  $F(\theta)$  and  $C(\theta)$  as a set instead of  $H(\theta)$  and  $C(\theta)$ , and the method of approximating the matrix form to drop the computation order dramatically reduces the computation time.

# 5 APPLICATION TO HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION

In previous sections, we have demonstrated that TIC is a reasonable estimator of the generalization gap that is also effective in the training process and can be computed fast. Motivated by these, in

(b): SHA Pruning using Validation Loss  
(c) : SHA Pruning using TIC

this section, we employ the TIC values on the training processes to accelerate hyperparameter optimization (HPO). HPO is an essential task to achieve good performance in a wide range of machine learning algorithms (Feurer & Hutter, 2019). In particular, the performance of DNNs depends significantly on the selection of the hyperparameters, such as learning rates, weight decay, and momentum (Lucic et al., 2018; Henderson et al., 2018; Dacrema et al., 2019).

Successive halving algorithm (SHA) (Jamieson & Talwalkar, 2016) shows promising performance in HPO by utilizing the iterative structure of DNNs. SHA prunes unpromising hyperparameters at early stage by utilizing not only a final loss but also intermediate losses. The validation loss obtained by the hold out method is usually used as the intermediate loss for SHA. However, the validation loss is often numerically unstable, as shown in Figure 5.

To achieve stable optimization in SHA, we apply the TIC values for the intermediate loss. One advantage of using TIC is that it can take into account the variance as bias term in equation 1, which was not taken into account in the validation loss obtained by the hold out method. In particular, TIC is known to be asymptotically close to leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) (Stone, 1977), and is superior to Hold-Out in terms of the order of estimates error. Details are given in Appendix B. We conduct an experiment to investigate the effectiveness of using the TIC values in SHA. Figure 5 shows the result of the experiment. The TIC values with the proposed approximation method can select 1st top trial, while the traditional method  $(\mathrm{SHA} + \mathrm{the~validation~loss~obtained~by~the~hold~out}$  method) selects 3rd top trial.

# 6 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

This study conducted a comprehensive experiment and observed that the TIC approximation method captures the generalization gap, even in the practical DNN setting close to the NTK regime. We have shown that the generalization gap could be captured in the training process, even if the model is not completed to train. Based on these results, we tested the validity of using TIC as an assessment value for HPO branch pruning and confirmed a valid case. It is challenging to establish a theory to discuss in the active regime (outside of the NTK regime) for future work. Especially, WAIC can handle singular models and applied to DNN; the difficulty arises for calculation; thus, it is required to have an approximation method. Still, it is necessary to bridge the theory of DNN for the validity of the approximation.
