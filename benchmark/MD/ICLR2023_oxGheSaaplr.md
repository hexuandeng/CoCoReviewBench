# ABSTRACT

Cross-silo federated learning utilizes a few hundred reliable data silos with high-speed access links to jointly train a model. While this approach becomes a popular setting in federated learning, designing a robust topology to reduce the training time is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a new multigraph topology for cross-silo federated learning. We first construct the multigraph using the overlay graph. We then parse this multigraph into different simple graphs with isolated nodes. The existence of isolated nodes allows us to perform model aggregation without waiting for other nodes, hence reducing the training time. We further propose a new distributed learning algorithm to use with our multigraph topology. The intensive experiments on public datasets show that our proposed method significantly reduces the training time compared with recent state-of-the-art topologies while ensuring convergence and maintaining the accuracy.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Federated learning entails training models via remote devices or siloed data centers while keeping data locally to respect the user's privacy policy (Li et al., 2020a). According to Kairouz et al. (2019), there are two popular training scenarios: the cross-device scenario, which encompasses a variety (millions or even billions) of unreliable edge devices with limited computational capacity and slow connection speeds; and the cross-silo scenario, which involves only a few hundred reliable data silos with powerful computing resources and high-speed access links. Recently, cross-silo scenario becomes popular in different federated learning applications such as healthcare (Xu et al., 2021), robotics (Nguyen et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021c), medical imaging (Courtiol et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021), and finance (Shingi, 2020).

In practice, federated learning is a promising research direction where we can utilize the ef

fectiveness of machine learning methods while respecting the user's privacy. Key challenges in federated learning include model convergence, communication congestion, and imbalance of data distributions in different silos (Kairouz et al., 2019). A popular federated training method is to set a central node that orchestrates the training process and aggregates contributions of all clients. Main limitation of this client-server approach is that the server node potentially represents a communication congestion point in the system, especially when the number of clients is large. To overcome this limitation, recent research has investigated the decentralized (or peer-to-peer) federated learning approach. In the aforementioned approach, the communication is done via peer-to-peer topology without the need for a central node. However, main challenge of decentralized federated learning is to achieve fast training time, while assuring model convergence and maintaining the model accuracy.

In federated learning, the communication topology plays an important role. A more efficient topology leads to quicker convergence and reduces the training time, quantifying by the worst-case convergence bounds in the topology design (Jiang et al., 2017; Nedic et al., 2018; Wang & Joshi, 2018). Furthermore, topology design is directly related to other problems during the training process such as network congestion, the overall accuracy of the trained model, or energy usage (Yang et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2021; Kang et al., 2019). Designing a robust topology that can reduce the training time while maintaining the model accuracy is still an open problem in federated learning (Kairouz et al., 2019). This paper aims to design a new topology for cross-silo federated learning, which is one of the most common training scenarios in practice.

Recently, different topologies have been proposed for cross-silo federated learning. In (Brandes, 2008), the STAR topology is designed where the orchestrator averages all models throughout each communication round. Wang et al. (2019) propose MATCHA to decompose the set of possible communications into pairs of clients. At each communication round, they randomly select some pairs and allow them to transmit models. Marfoq et al. (2020) introduce the RING topology with the largest throughput using max-plus linear systems. While some progress has been made in the field, there are challenging problems that need to be addressed such as congestion at access links (Wang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021), straggler effect (Neglia et al., 2019; Park et al., 2021), or identical topology in all communication rounds (Jiang et al., 2017; Marfoq et al., 2020).

In this paper, we propose a new multigraph topology based on the recent RING topology (Marfoq et al., 2020) to reduce the training time for cross-silo federated learning. Our method first constructs the multigraph based on the overlay of RING topology. Then we parse this multigraph into simple graphs (i.e., graphs with only one edge between two nodes). We call each simple graph is a state of the multigraph. Each state of the multigraph may have isolated nodes, and these nodes can do model aggregation without waiting for other nodes. This strategy significantly reduces the cycle time in each communication round. To ensure model convergence, we also adapt and propose a new distributed learning algorithm. The intensive experiments show that our proposed topology significantly reduces the training time in cross-silo federated learning (See Figure 1).

# 2 LITERATURE REVIEW

Federated Learning. Federated learning has been regarded as a system capable of safeguarding data privacy (Konečný et al., 2016; Gong et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021b; Li et al., 2021b). Contemporary federated learning has a centralized network design in which a central node receives gradients from the client nodes to update a global model. Early findings of federated learning research include the work of Konečný et al. (2015), as well as a widely circulated article from McMahan & Ramage (2017). Then Yang et al. (2013); Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang (2013); Ma et al. (2015); Jaggi et al. (2014), and Smith et al. (2018) extend the concept of federated learning and its related distributed optimization algorithms. Federated Averaging (FedAvg) was proposed by McMahan et al. (2017), its variations such as FedSage (Zhang et al., 2021a) and DGA (Zhu et al., 2021b), or other recent state-of-the-art model aggregation methods (Hong et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Elgabli et al., 2022) are introduced to address the convergence and non-IID (non-identically and independently distributed) problem. Despite its simplicity, the client-server approach suffers from the communication and computational bottlenecks in the central node, especially when the number of clients is large (He et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2022).

Decentralized Federated Learning. Decentralized (or peer-to-peer) federated learning allows each silo data to interact with its neighbors directly without a central node (He et al., 2019). Due to its nature, decentralized federated learning does not have the communication congestion at the central node, however, optimizing a fully peer-to-peer network is a challenging task (Nedic & Olshevsky, 2014; Lian et al., 2017; He et al., 2018; Lian et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Marfoq et al., 2020; 2021; Li et al., 2021a). Noticeably, the decentralized periodic averaging stochastic gradient descent (Wang & Joshi, 2018) is proved to converge at a comparable rate to the centralized algorithm while allowing large-scale model training (Wu et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2018; Odeyomi & Zaruba, 2021). Recently, systematic analysis of the decentralized federated learning has been explored by (Li et al., 2018b; Ghosh et al., 2020; Koloskova et al., 2020).

Communication Topology. The topology has a direct impact on the complexity and convergence of federated learning (Chen et al., 2020). Many works have been introduced to improve the effective

ness of topology, including star-shaped topology (Brandes, 2008; Konečný et al., 2016; McMahan et al., 2016; 2017; Kairouz et al., 2019) and optimized-shaped topology (Neglia et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Marfoq et al., 2020; Bellet et al., 2021; Vogels et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022). Particularly, a spanning tree topology based on Prim (1957) algorithm was introduced by Marfoq et al. (2020) to reduce the training time. As mentioned by Brandes (2008), STAR topology is designed where an orchestrator averages model updates in each communication round. Wang et al. (2019) introduce MATCHA to speed up the training process through decomposition sampling. Since the duration of a communication round is dictated by stragglers effect (Karakus et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a), Neglia et al. (2019) explore how to choose the degree of a regular topology. Marfoq et al. (2020) propose RING topology for cross-silo federated learning using the theory of max-plus linear systems. Recently, Huang et al. (2022) introduce Sample-induced Topology which is able to recover effectiveness of existing SGD-based algorithms along with their corresponding rates.

Multigraph. The definition of multigraph has been introduced as a traditional paradigm (Gibbons, 1985; Walker, 1992). A typical "graph" usually refers to a simple graph with no loops or multiple edges between two nodes. Different from a simple graph, multigraph allows multiple edges between two nodes. In deep learning, multigraph has been applied in different domains, including clustering (Martschat, 2013; Luo et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2020), medical image processing (Liu et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2021; Bessadok et al., 2021), traffic flow prediction (Lv et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021a), activity recognition (Stikic et al., 2009), recommendation system (Tang et al., 2021), and cross-domain adaptation (Ouyang et al., 2019). In this paper, we construct the multigraph to enable isolated nodes and reduce the training time in cross-silo federated learning.

# 3 PRELIMINARIES

# 3.1 FEDERATED LEARNING

In federated learning, silos do not share their local data, but still periodically transmit model updates between them. Given  $N$  siloed data centers, the objective function for federated learning is:

$$
\min  _ {\mathbf {w} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} p _ {i} \mathbb {E} _ {\xi_ {i}} \left[ L _ {i} \left(\mathbf {w}, \xi_ {i}\right) \right], \tag {1}
$$

where  $L_{i}(\mathbf{w},\xi_{i})$  is the loss of model  $\mathbf{w}\in \mathbb{R}^d$ .  $\xi_{i}$  is an input sample drawn from data at silo  $i$ . The coefficient  $p_i > 0$  specifies the relative importance of each silo. Recently, different distributed algorithms have been proposed to optimize Eq. 1 (Konecny et al., 2016; McMahan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Wang & Joshi, 2018; Karimireddy et al., 2020). In this work, we use DPASGD (Wang & Joshi, 2018) algorithm to update the weight of silo  $i$  in each training round as follows:

$$
\mathbf {w} _ {i} (k + 1) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \sum_ {j \in \mathcal {N} _ {i} ^ {+} \cup \{i \}} \mathbf {A} _ {i, j} \mathbf {w} _ {j} (k), & \text {i f k \equiv 0 (m o d u + 1)}, \\ \mathbf {w} _ {i} (k) - \alpha_ {k} \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {b} \nabla L _ {i} \left(\mathbf {w} _ {i} (k), \xi_ {i} ^ {(h)} (k)\right), & \text {o t h e r w i s e}. \end{array} \right. \tag {2}
$$

where  $b$  is the batch size,  $i,j$  denote the silo,  $u$  is the number of local updates,  $\alpha_{k} > 0$  is a potentially varying learning rate at  $k$ -th round,  $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$  is a consensus matrix with non-negative weights, and  $\mathcal{N}_i^+$  is the in-neighbors set that silo  $i$  has the connection to.

# 3.2 MULTIGRAPH FOR FEDERATED LEARNING

Connectivity and Overlay. Following Marfoq et al. (2020), we consider the connectivity  $\mathcal{G}_c = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}_c)$  as a graph that captures possible direct communications among silos. Based on its definition, the connectivity is often a fully connected graph and is also a directed graph. The overlay  $\mathcal{G}_o$  is a connected subgraph of the connectivity graph, i.e.,  $\mathcal{G}_o = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}_o)$ , where  $\mathcal{E}_o\subset \mathcal{E}_c$ . Only nodes directly connected in the overlay graph  $\mathcal{G}_o$  will exchange the messages during training. We refer the readers to Marfoq et al. (2020) for more in-deep discussions.

Multigraph. While the connectivity and overlay graph can represent different topologies for federated learning, one of their drawbacks is that there is only one connection between two nodes. In our

(d) State of Multigraph

work, we construct a multigraph  $\mathcal{G}_m = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}_m)$  from the overlay  $\mathcal{G}_o$ . The multigraph can contain multiple edges between two nodes (Chartrand & Zhang, 2013). In practice, we parse this multigraph to different graph states, each state is a simple graph with only one edge between two nodes.

In the multigraph  $\mathcal{G}_m$ , the connection edge between two nodes has two types: strongly-connected edge and weakly-connected edge (Ke-xing et al., 2016). Under both strongly and weakly connections, the participated nodes can transmit their trained models to their out-neighbours  $\mathcal{N}_i^-$  or download models from their in-neighbours  $\mathcal{N}_i^+$ . However, in a strongly-connected edge, two nodes in the graph must wait until all upload and download processes between them are finished to do model aggregation. On the other hand, in a weakly-connected edge, the model aggregation process in each node can be established whenever the previous training process is finished by leveraging up-to-dated models which have not been used before from the in-neighbours of that node.

State of Multigraph. Given a multigraph  $\mathcal{G}_m$ , we can parse this multigraph into different simple graphs with only one connection between two nodes (either strongly-connected or weakly-connected). We call each simple graph as a state  $\mathcal{G}_m^s$  of the multigraph.

Isolated Node. A node is called isolated when all of its connections to other nodes are weakly-connected edges. The graph concepts and isolated nodes are shown in Figure 2.

# 3.3 DELAY AND CYCLE TIME IN MULTIGRAPH

Delay. Following Marfoq et al. (2020), a delay to an edge  $e(i,j)$  is the time interval when node  $j$  receives the weight sending by node  $i$ , which can be defined by:

$$
d (i, j) = u \times T _ {c} (i) + l (i, j) + \frac {M}{O (i , j)} \tag {3}
$$

where  $T_{c}(i)$  denotes the time to compute one local update of the model;  $u$  is the number of local updates;  $l(i,j)$  is the link latency;  $M$  is the model size;  $O(i,j)$  is the total network traffic capacity.

However, unlike other communication infrastructures, the multigraph only contains connections between silos without other nodes such as routers or amplifiers. Thus, the total network traffic capacity  $O(i,j) = \min \left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{UP}}(i)}{|\mathcal{N}_i^-|},\frac{C_{\mathrm{DN}}(j)}{|\mathcal{N}_i^+|}\right)$  where  $C_\mathrm{UP}$  and  $C_\mathrm{DN}$  denote the upload and download link capacity. Note that the upload and download can happen in parallel.

Since multigraph can contain multiple edges between two nodes, we extend the definition of the delay in Eq. 3 to  $d_{k}(i,j)$ , with  $k$  is the  $k$ -th communication round during the training process, as:

$$
d _ {k} (i, j) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} d _ {k} (i, j), & \text {i f} \left(e _ {k} (i, j) = \mathbb {1} \text {a n d} e _ {k - 1} (i, j) = \mathbb {1}\right) \text {o r} k = 0 \\ \max  \left(u \times T _ {c} (j), d _ {k} (i, j) - d _ {k - 1} (i, j)\right), & \text {i f} e _ {k} (i, j) = \mathbb {1} \text {a n d} e _ {k - 1} (i, j) = \mathbb {0} \\ \tau_ {k} (\mathcal {G} _ {m}) + d _ {k - 1} (i, j)), & \text {i f} e _ {k} (i, j) = \mathbb {0} \text {a n d} e _ {k - 1} (i, j) = \mathbb {0} \\ \tau_ {k} (\mathcal {G} _ {m}), & \text {o t h e r w i s e} \end{array} \right. \tag {4}
$$

where  $e(i,j) = \emptyset$  indicates weakly-connected edge,  $e(i,j) = \mathbb{1}$  indicates strongly-connected edge;  $\tau_k(\mathcal{G}_m)$  is the cycle time at the  $k$ -th computation round during the training process.

Cycle Time. The cycle time per round is the time required to complete a communication round (Marfoq et al., 2020). In this work, we define the cycle time per round as the maximum delay between all silo pairs with strongly-connected edges. Therefore, the average cycle time of the entire training is:

$$
\tau \left(\mathcal {G} _ {m}\right) = \frac {1}{k} \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {k - 1} \left(\max  _ {j \in \mathcal {N} _ {i} ^ {+ +} \cup \{i \}, \forall i \in \mathcal {V}} \left(d _ {k} (j, i)\right)\right) \tag {5}
$$

where  $\mathcal{N}_i^{++}$  is an in-neighbors silo set of  $i$  whose edges are strongly-connected.

# 4 METHODOLOGY

Our method first constructs the multigraph based on an overlay. Then we parse this multigraph into multiple states that may have isolated nodes. Note that, our method does not choose isolated nodes randomly, but relies on the delay time. In our design, each isolated node has a long delay time in a current communication round. However, in the next round, its delay time will be updated using Eq. 4, and therefore it can become a normal node. This strategy allows us to reduce the waiting time with isolated nodes, while ensuring that isolated nodes can become normal nodes and contribute to the training in the next communication round.

# 4.1 MULTIGRAPH CONSTRUCTION

return  $\mathcal{G}_m = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}_m);\mathcal{L}$

Algorithm 1 describes our methods to generate the multigraph  $\mathcal{G}_m$  with multiple edges between silos. The algorithm takes the overlay  $\mathcal{G}_o$  as input. Similar to Marfoq et al. (2020), we use the Christofides algorithm (Monnot et al., 2003) to obtain the overlay.

In Algorithm 1, we focus on establishing multiple edges that indicate different statuses (strongly-connected or weakly-connected). To identify the total edges between a silo pair, we divide the delay  $d(i,j)$  by the smallest delay  $d_{\mathrm{min}}$  over all silo pairs, and compare it with the maximum number of edges parameter  $t$  ( $t = 5$  in our experiments). We assume that the silo pairs with longer delay will have more weakly-connected edges, hence potentially becoming the isolated nodes. Overall, we aim to increase the number of weakly-connected edges, which generate more isolated nodes to speed up

the training process. Note that, from Algorithm 1, each silo pair in the multigraph should have one strongly-connected edge and multiple weakly-connected edges. The role of the strongly-connected edge is to make sure that two silos have a good connection in at least one communication round.

Lines denote strongly-connected edges, dotted lines denote weakly-connected ones, and the blue color indicates isolated nodes.

# 4.2 MULTIGRAPH PARSING

In Algorithm 2, we parse multigraph  $\mathcal{G}_m$  into multiple graph states  $\mathcal{G}_m^s$ . Graph states are essential to identify the connection status of silos in a specific communication round to perform model aggregation. In each graph state, our goal is to identify the isolated nodes. During the training, isolated nodes update their weights internally and ignore all weakly-connected edges that connect to them.

To parse the multigraph into graph states, we first identify the maximum of states in a multigraph  $s_{\mathrm{max}}$  by using the least common multiple (LCM) (Hardy et al., 1979). We then parse the multigraph into  $s_{\mathrm{max}}$  states. The first state is always the overlay since we want to make sure all silos have a reliable topology at the beginning to ease the training. The reminding states are parsed so there is only one connection between two nodes. Using our algorithm, some states will contain isolated nodes. During the training process, only one graph state is used in a communication round. Figure 3 illustrates the training process in each communication round using multiple graph states.

# 4.3 MULTIGRAPH TRAINING

The original DPASGD algorithm (Wang & Joshi, 2018) can not be directly used with our multigraph because the learning process will be terminated when it first meets an isolated node. To overcome this problem, we introduce an upgraded version of DPASGD, namely, DPASGD++ (See Algorithm 3 for details). In each communication round, a state graph  $\mathcal{G}_m^s$  is selected in a sequence that identifies the topology design used for training. We then collect all strongly-connected edges in the graph state  $\mathcal{G}_m^s$  in such a way that nodes with strongly-connected edges need to wait for neighbors, while the isolated ones can update their models. Formally, the weight in DPASGD++ is updated as:

$$
\mathbf {w} _ {i} (k + 1) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \sum_ {j \in \mathcal {N} _ {i} ^ {+ +} \cup \{i \}} \mathbf {A} _ {i, j} \mathbf {w} _ {j} (k - h), & \text {i f k} \equiv 0 (\bmod u + 1) \& \left| \mathcal {N} _ {i} ^ {+ +} \right| > 1, \\ \mathbf {w} _ {i} (k) - \alpha_ {k} \frac {1}{b} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {b} \nabla L _ {i} \left(\mathbf {w} _ {i} (k), \xi_ {i} ^ {(h)} (k)\right), & \text {o t h e r w i s e .} \end{array} \right. \tag {6}
$$

where  $(k - h)$  is the index of the considered weights;  $h$  is initialized to 0 and is changed when the condition in Eq. 7 is met, i.e.,

$$
h = h + 1, \quad \text {i f} e _ {k - h} (i, j) = \mathbb {0} \tag {7}
$$

Through Eq. 6 and Eq. 7, at each state, if a silo is not an isolated node, it must wait for the model from its neighbor to update its weight. If a silo is an isolated node, it can use the model in its neighbor from the  $(k - h)$  round to update its weight immediately.

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

# 5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Datasets. We use three datasets in our experiments to evaluate our multigraph topology: Sentiment140 (Go et al., 2009), iNaturalist (Van Horn et al., 2018), and FEMNIST (Caldas et al., 2018). All datasets and the pre-processing process are conducted by following recent works (Wang et al., 2019) and (Marfoq et al., 2020). Details of our experimental setup is in Appendix D.

Network. Following Marfoq et al. (2020), we consider five distributed networks in our experiments: Exodus, Ebone, Géant, Amazon (Miller et al., 2010) and Gaia (Hsieh et al., 2017). The Exodus, Ebone, and Géant are from the Internet Topology Zoo (Knight et al., 2011). The Amazon and Gaia network are synthetic and are constructed using the geographical locations of the data centers.

Baselines. We compare our multigraph topology with recent state-of-the-art topology designs: STAR (Brandes, 2008), MATCHA (Wang et al., 2019), MATCHA(+) (Marfoq et al., 2020), MST (Prim, 1957),  $\delta$ -MBST (Marfoq et al., 2020), and RING (Marfoq et al., 2020).

# 5.2 RESULTS

Table 1 shows the cycle time of our method in comparison with other recent approaches. This table illustrates that our proposed method significantly reduces the cycle time in all setups with different networks and datasets. In particular, compared to the state-of-the-art RING (Marfoq et al., 2020), our method reduces the cycle time by 2.18, 1.5, 1.74 times in average in the FEMNIST, iNaturalist, Sentiment140 dataset, respectively. Our method also clearly outperforms MACHA, MACHA(+), and MST by a large margin. The results confirm that our multigraph with isolated nodes helps to reduce the cycle and training time in federated learning.

Table 1: Cycle time (ms) comparison between different typologies.  $(\downarrow \circ)$  indicates our reduced times compared with other methods.

From Table 1, our multigraph achieves the minimum improvement under the Amazon network in all three datasets. This can be explained that, under the Amazon network, our proposed topology does not generate many isolated nodes. Hence, the improvement is limited. Intuitively, when there are no isolated nodes, our multigraph will become the overlay, and the cycle time of our multigraph will be equal to the cycle time of the overlay in RING.

# 5.3 ABLATION STUDY

Convergence Analysis. Figure 4 shows the training loss versus the number of communication rounds and the wall-clock time under Exodus network using the FEMNIST dataset. This figure illustrates that our proposed topology converges faster than other methods while maintaining the model accuracy. We observe the same results in other datasets and network setups. We provide the proof of convergence of our proposed method in Appendix A.

Cycle Time and Accuracy Trade-off. In our method, the maximum number of edges between two nodes  $t$  in Algorithm 1 mainly affects the number of isolated nodes. This leads to a trade-off between the model accuracy and cycle time. Table 2 illustrates the effectiveness of this parameter. When  $t = 1$ , we technically consider there are no weak connections and isolated nodes. Therefore, our method uses the original overlay from RING. When  $t$  is set higher, we can increase the number of isolated nodes, hence decreasing the cycle time. In practice, too many isolated nodes will limit the model weights to be exchanged between silos. Therefore, models at isolated nodes are biased to their local data and consequently affect the final accuracy.

Multigraph vs. RING vs. Random Strategy. The isolated nodes plays an important role in our method as we can skip the model aggregation step in the isolated nodes. In practice, we can have a trivial solution to create isolated nodes by randomly removing some nodes from the overlay of RING. Table 3 shows the experiment results in two scenarios on FEMNIST dataset and Exodus Network: i) Randomly remove some silos in the overlay of RING, and ii) Remove most inefficient silos (i.e., silos with the longest delay) in the overlay of RING. Note that, in RING, one overlay is used in all communication rounds. From Table 3, the cycle time reduces significantly when two aforementioned scenarios are applied. However, the accuracy of the model also drops greatly. This experiment shows that although randomly removing some nodes from the overlay of RING is a trivial solution, it can not maintain model accuracy. On the other hand, our multigraph not only reduces the cycle time of the model, but also preserves the accuracy. This is because our multigraph can skip the aggregation step of the isolated nodes in a communication round. However, in the next round, the delay time of these isolated nodes will be updated, and they can become the normal nodes and contribute to the final model.

(b) 10 Gbps Orchestra access capacity

Access Link Capacities Analysis. Following Marfoq et al. (2020), we analyse the effect of access link capacity on our multigraph topology. Access link capacity is related to the bandwidth when packages are transmitted between silos. Figure 5 shows the results under Exodus network and FEMNIST dataset in two scenarios: all access links have the same 1 Gbps capacity and one orchestra node has a fixed 10 Gbps access link capacity. From Figure 5, we can see that our multigraph topology slightly outperforms RING when the link capacity is low. However, when the capacity between silos is high, then our method clearly improves over RING. In all setups, our method archives the best cycle time and training time.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We proposed a new multigraph topology for cross-silo federated learning. Our method first constructs the multigraph using the overlay. Different graph states are then parsed from the multigraph and used in each communication round. Our method reduces the cycle time by allowing the isolated nodes in the multigraph to do model aggregation without waiting for other nodes. The intensive experiments on three datasets show that our proposed topology achieves new state-of-the-art results in all network and dataset setups.
