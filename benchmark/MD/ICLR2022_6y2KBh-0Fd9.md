# ABSTRACT

Deep generative models have been widely used in practical applications such as the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this work, we aim to re-examine the potential of generative flow models in OOD detection. We first propose a simple combination of univariate one-sample statistical test (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and random projections in the latent space of flow models to perform OOD detection. Then, we propose a two-sample version of our test to account for imperfect flow models. Quite distinctly, our method does not pose parametric assumptions on OOD data and is capable of exploiting any flow model. Experimentally, firstly we confirm the efficacy of our method against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments on several image datasets; secondly we investigate the relationship between model accuracy (e.g., the generation quality) and the OOD detection performance, and found surprisingly that they are not always positively correlated; and thirdly we show that detection in the latent space of flow models generally outperforms detection in the sample space across various OOD datasets, hence highlighting the benefits of training a flow model.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Reliably detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, also known as anomaly, plays an important role in many deployed machine learning systems, particularly so when the system may be under attack by a malicious adversary (Markou & Singh, 2003a;b; Toth & Chawla, 2018; Chalapathy & Chawla, 2019). The bulk of existing OOD detection algorithms, in one way or another, boils down to thresholding the (density) likelihood, which can be conveniently estimated by modern flow-based generative models. However, quite surprisingly, recent studies (Nalisnick et al., 2019a) reveal that flows that are trained to maximize the likelihood of in-distribution (InD) data may actually assign a higher likelihood to OOD data. For example, the flow-based model Glow (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018) trained on CIFAR-10 that contains natural images (e.g., dog, cat, and ship) is found to assign a higher likelihood to SVHN that consists of house numbers. Such surprising and counter-intuitive observations lead to natural questions on the applicability of flow models for performing the OOD detection by merely thresholding the log-likelihood.

In this work, we re-examine the ability of flow-based generative models for OOD detection. Flow models typically transform a prior distribution that is easy to sample from to the data distribution via an invertible mapping (Tabak & Vanden-Eijnden, 2010; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Dinh et al., 2017; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018). Building on this property, we propose to compare the training and test samples in the latent space of a flow model, as opposed to relying on point-wise scoring functions such as the log-likelihood. To this end, we divide test samples into minibatches (groups). Examples of group OOD detection with generative models include for instance Nalisnick et al. (2019b); Song et al. (2019); Chalapathy et al. (2018); Zhang et al. (2020), most of which consider either the raw input or certain representation of the raw input in the sample space for detection. In contrast, we exploit data representations in the latent space, and confirm its advantage experimentally. Moreover, to cope with the curse of dimensionality (as is typical in image datasets), we propose to leverage random projections (Friedman et al., 1984), which frees one from designing any extra network architectures and is computationally very efficient. Our proposed detection algorithm combines classic univariate statistical tests and random projections in the latent space of flow models.

Besides the scoring function used for detection and the representation of data, model accuracy also greatly affects OOD detection performance (Zhang et al., 2021; Choi et al., 2018). To account for imperfectly trained flow models, we propose a two-sample version of our detection algorithm for practical use. Surprisingly, in our experiments, we confirm that model accuracy, indicated by its generation quality, may not always be positively correlated with its OOD detection performance.

We summarize our contributions as follows:

- We propose the OOD detection algorithms GOD1KS and GOD2KS for ideal and imperfect flow models, respectively, which pose no parametric assumption on the OOD data. To evade the curse of dimensionality, we propose to randomly project the latent space of flow models onto the real line and perform univariate statistical tests (such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov, KS) there. Our method is computationally very efficient, requires no extra network architecture, and unifies OOD detection in both sample space and latent space.  
- Experimentally, 1) we compare with the state-of-the-art benchmarks on various image datasets and obtain competitive results; 2) we confirm on larger models and real datasets that model accuracy may not always be positively correlated with OOD detection performance; and 3) we compare detection in the sample space versus in the latent space of the flow model, and reveal the superiority and robustness of the latter, hence highlighting the potential of flow models in OOD detection.

# 2 OOD DETECTION WITH FLOW MODELS

In this section, we state the OOD detection problem and propose statistical tests that exploit modern flow generative models (either perfect or imperfectly trained).

# 2.1 OOD DETECTION: GROUP VS. POINTWISE

Let  $\mathcal{D} = \{X_1, \ldots, X_n\} \stackrel{\mathrm{i.i.d.}}{\sim} p$  be a sample from an in-distribution (InD)  $p$ . Our goal is to construct a statistical test that can decide if a test sample  $\{Y_1, \ldots, Y_m\}$  is from  $p$  (InD) or some unknown out-of-distribution (OOD)  $q$ . When  $m = 1$ , i.e. we examine one test sample at a time, it is often called the pointwise OOD detection while group OOD detection refers to  $m > 1$ . The former is significantly more challenging and requires careful specification of the OOD distribution (Zhang et al., 2021), while the latter is our focus here. In either case, often we only have access to the InD sample  $\mathcal{D}$ , and most existing approaches construct tests based on an estimated density  $p_\theta$  of the in-distribution  $p$ . Following Bishop (1994) and the recent works (e.g. Nalisnick et al., 2019b; Zhang et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2019) we are interested in studying the applicability of modern flow generative models to the group OOD detection problem.

# 2.2 FLOW-BASED GENERATIVE MODELS

A flow-based generative model simply learns a transformation  $\mathsf{T}$ , typically a diffeomorphism, that pushes a latent distribution  $p_0$  (e.g., Gaussian or uniform) to the in-distribution  $p$ , i.e.

$$
Z \sim p _ {0} \Longrightarrow \mathsf {T} (Z) \approx p, \quad \text {a l s o d e n o t a s} p \approx \mathsf {T} _ {\#} p _ {0}. \tag {1}
$$

In particular, when  $\mathsf{T}$  is diffeomorphic, we have the familiar change-of-variable formula:

$$
\left. p _ {\mathrm {T}} (\mathbf {x}) = p _ {0} (\mathbf {z}) / \left| \mathrm {T} ^ {\prime} (\mathbf {z}) \right| = p _ {0} \left(\mathrm {T} ^ {- 1} (\mathbf {x})\right) / \left| \mathrm {T} ^ {\prime} \left(\mathrm {T} ^ {- 1} (\mathbf {x})\right) \right|, \right. \tag {2}
$$

where  $|\mathsf{T}'(\mathbf{z})|$  denotes the absolute value of the Jacobian of  $\mathsf{T}$ . A flow model parameterizes  $\mathsf{T}$  through a neural network and estimates  $\mathsf{T}$  by minimizing some divergence between  $p_{\mathsf{T}}$  (the model density) and  $p$  (the data density), based on the training data  $\mathcal{D}$ . Once  $\mathsf{T}$  is learned, we can easily generate new data by simply sampling  $Z$  from  $p_0$  and then pushing through  $\mathsf{T}$ , i.e.  $X = \mathsf{T}(Z)$ .

Denote  $X_{1} \stackrel{\mathrm{d}}{=} X_{2}$  if they follow the same distribution. For any transformation  $\mathsf{T}$ , it is clear that

$$
X _ {1} \stackrel {\mathrm {d}} {=} X _ {2} \Rightarrow \mathsf {T} \left(X _ {1}\right) \stackrel {\mathrm {d}} {=} \mathsf {T} \left(X _ {2}\right), \tag {3}
$$

and the converse also holds if  $\mathsf{T}$  is invertible. In fact, a sufficiently regular transformation  $\mathsf{T}$  may preserve many familiar statistical divergences  $\mathbf{D}$ , i.e.

$$
\mathbf {D} \left(X _ {1}, X _ {2}\right) = \mathbf {D} \left(\mathsf {T} \left(X _ {1}\right), \mathsf {T} \left(X _ {2}\right)\right), \tag {4}
$$

Figure 1: Examples of 2-D Gaussian in the latent space. In (a) and (b), left: the densities of InD and OOD; and middle and right: the density histograms of InD and OOD in each latent dimension.

for instance, when  $\mathbf{D}$  is the  $f$ -divergence, such as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence,  $\mathsf{T}$  is diffeomorphic, and  $X_{1}$  and  $X_{2}$  are continuous (Csiszár, 1963). Another example is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance for real-valued  $X_{i}$  and monotonic  $\mathsf{T}$ :

$$
\mathbf {D} \left(X _ {1}, X _ {2}\right) := \sup  _ {x} | F _ {1} (x) - F _ {2} (x) |, \tag {5}
$$

where  $F_{i}$  is the CDF of  $X_{i}$ , as well as the Cramér-von Mises (CvM) divergence (Darling, 1957):

$$
\mathbf {D} \left(X _ {1}, X _ {2}\right) := \int \left[ F _ {1} (x) - F _ {2} (x) \right] ^ {2} \mathrm {d} F _ {2} (x). \tag {6}
$$

Thus, for group OOD detection, we can first train an invertible flow model based on the InD samples and then construct a scoring function or statistical test either in the sample space (where the test sample  $\{Y_j\}$  resides), or in the latent space (where  $\{\mathsf{T}^{-1}(Y_j)\}$  resides). However, since both  $Y_{j}$  and its pre-image  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}(Y_j)$  are typically of high dimension and the sample size  $m$  is comparatively small, some compromise needs to be made in order to evade the curse of dimensionality. For instance, Zhang et al. (2020) fit a multivariate Gaussian in the latent space using  $\{\mathsf{T}^{-1}(Y_j)\}$  and compute analytically the KL divergence between two Gaussians. Nalisnick et al. (2019b) project  $Y_{i}$  onto the real line using the estimated log-likelihood function  $\log p_{\mathrm{T}}$  and construct a typicality test there, while Choi et al. (2018) instead employ the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC).

To illustrate the above idea, we compare in Figure 1 the distributions of  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{train}})$  and  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{test}})$  in the latent space using synthetic 2-D Gaussian datasets and the flow model RealNVP (Dinh et al., 2017). We observe that in the latent space the distribution of the OOD samples (i.e.,  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{OOD - test}})$ ) is distinct from the distributions of the in-distribution samples (i.e., both  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{InD - train}})$  and  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{InD - test}})$ ). Moreover, we found that the transformation  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}$  can roughly keep the statistical distance in the latent space. In other words, distributions that are far away from the in-distribution in the sample space also tend to remain far away in the latent space.

# 2.3 OOD DETECTION VIA RANDOM PROJECTIONS

For a perfectly trained flow model, its inverse transformation  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}$  should bring the in-distribution samples to follow (approximately) the prior distribution  $p_0$ , such as the commonly used standard normal. It is thus natural to perform OOD detection by comparing  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{test}})$  against the prior distribution  $p_0$ , whereas the InD training samples  $\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{train}}$  are used to train the flow parameterized by  $\mathsf{T}$ . To accommodate any prior distribution  $p_0$ , we propose to extend standard statistical tests such as the KS distance in eq. (5) to high dimensions.

To our best knowledge, multivariate KS test has only been studied sporadically in the literature, due to the computational difficulty in enumerating the maximum in high dimensions. For instance, Justel et al. (1997) proposed a complicated numerical procedure to compute the KS distance (incidentally also in the latent space) but only for bivariate distributions. Instead, we propose to randomly project high-dimensional random vectors to the real line and run classic KS test there. We note that similar ideas have been used to train generative models (e.g. Friedman et al., 1984; Bonneel et al., 2015; Kolouri et al., 2016; Liutkus et al., 2019; Paty & Cuturi, 2019; Nguyen et al., 2021), while we allow any flow models and use random projection only to construct the KS test (and related).

Figure 2 provides a simple example to illustrate the main idea. Consider two 2-d Gaussian distributions:  $\mathcal{N}([0,0],\mathbf{I})$  and  $\mathcal{N}([0,0],[1,0.8;0.8,1])$ . Obviously, for the standard 2-d Gaussian all of its random projections along normalized directions follow  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ , whereas for the shown correlated Gaussian, only the projections along the coordinate axes follow  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . Therefore, we can distinguish these two distributions by comparing their projections along random directions.

For the standard Gaussian both  $proj_1$  (a) and  $proj_2$  (b) follow  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ ; while for the correlated Gaussian  $proj_1$  follows  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$  (c), and  $proj_2$  does not follow  $\mathcal{N}(0,\frac{1}{5})$ , instead of  $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$  (d).

More generally, the following theorem provides the theoretical basis for distributional comparison using random projections.

Theorem 1 (Cuesta-Albertos et al. 2007). Let  $X$  and  $Y$  be two  $\mathbb{R}^d$ -valued random vectors. Suppose the absolute moments  $m_k \coloneqq \mathbb{E}\|X\|^k$  are finite and  $\sum_{k=1}^\infty (m_k)^{-1/k} = \infty$ . If the set  $W = \{\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^d : \mathbf{w}^\top X \stackrel{\mathrm{d}}{=} \mathbf{w}^\top Y\}$  has positive Lebesgue measure, then  $X \stackrel{\mathrm{d}}{=} Y$ .

The assumption  $\sum_{k} (m_k)^{-1/k} = \infty$ , known as Carleman's condition, is very mild: it is satisfied if the underlying moment generating function is finite around the origin (hence such distributions are uniquely determined by their moments). Most distributions used in practice, such as the Gaussian distribution, clearly satisfy Carleman's condition. Put differently, Theorem 1 implies that a single random direction almost surely allows us to distinguish the projections of  $X$  and  $Y$ ; see Figure 2 for an illustration. We note that Theorem 1 can be slightly strengthened if we project to higher dimensional subspaces (Cuesta-Albertos et al., 2007), which, however, renders the classic KS test inapplicable. Therefore, in this work, we will only consider random projections onto the real line.

To be more specific, given a limited collection of test samples  $\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{test}}$  and a flow model  $\mathsf{T}$ , we first transform into the latent space and obtain  $\mathbf{Z} = \mathsf{T}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{test}})$ . Then, we sample  $n$  (uniformly) random directions  $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ , which are obtained by normalizing i.i.d. samples from the  $d$ -dimensional standard Gaussian. When the flow model  $\mathsf{T}$  is well-trained, the inverse transformation  $\mathsf{T}^{-1}$  applied to InD samples will bring them to follow approximately the latent prior distribution, e.g.,  $d$ -dimensional standard Gaussian. As a result, projection onto each random direction yields close proximity to the univariate standard Gaussian, which classic statistical tests such as KS would be able to pick up. In practice, we found that averaging over different random directions leads to slightly better and more robust performance, although the benefits quickly saturate as we increase the number of random projections. Crucially, the KS distance in eq. (5), with  $F_{1}$  being the empirical distribution of random projections  $W^{\top}\mathbf{Z}$  and  $F_{2}$  the latent prior distribution, can be computed in linear time by just enumerating  $x$  over each projected sample.

We call the resulting algorithm group OOD detection based on one-sample KS test (GOD1KS) and summarize it in Algorithm 1. Its computation requires one pass of the (inverse) flow model and the remaining operations are linear-time. A higher value of the KS statistics  $k_{ij}$  indicates a lower similarity between the test sample and the latent prior distribution, which can be taken as a metric of OOD-ness. We note that our algorithm is completely general and efficient:

- unlike Zhang et al. (2020) we do not require any matrix inversion or determinant and we avoid the difficult problem of estimating high dimensional covariance matrices when only very limited test samples are available;  
- in principle, we can work with any latent prior distribution and any univariate statistical tests. As pointed out by Jaini et al. (2020), a heavier tailed latent distribution, or even discrete ones, than the standard Gaussian may be advantageous in certain settings. Similarly, other statistical tests may prove useful if we desire to zoom in certain parts of the distribution. Our choice of the KS test is motivated by our experimental settings below and serves as a concrete example.

Algorithm 1: Group OOD detection based on one-sample KS test (GOD1KS).  
Input: Test OOD samples  $\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{test}}$  splitted into  $m$  groups  $\mathbf{X}_1,\dots ,\mathbf{X}_m$  with each  $\mathbf{X}_i\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times b}$  ( $b$  for batch size and  $d$  for dimension); random projection matrix  $\mathbf{W}\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ .  
for  $i\gets 1$  to  $m$  do  
 $\mathbf{Z}_i = \mathsf{T}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_i)\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times b}$  // transform into the latent space  
 $\mathbf{S}^{(i)} = \mathbf{W}^{\top}\mathbf{Z}_i\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times b}$  // project onto  $n$  random directions  
for  $j\gets 1$  to  $n$  do  
 $|k_{ij} = \mathrm{KS}(\mathbf{S}_{j:}^{(i)},\mathcal{N}(0,1))$  // conduct one-sample KS test  
 $k_{i}\gets \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}k_{ij}$  // average over  $n$  random directions  
compute AUROC for  $\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{test}}$  based on all  $k_{i}$ 's

- our algorithm can work with any flow model  $\mathsf{T}$ . For instance, we may even take  $\mathsf{T} = \mathrm{Id}$ , in which case Algorithm 1 reduces to performing statistical tests in the sample space. Thus, our algorithm unifies the two perspectives: test in the sample space vs. test in the latent space, which we will compare experimentally below.

# 2.4 IMPROVEMENT FOR IMPERFECT FLOW MODELS

When the flow model is not well-trained (perhaps even intentionally, for instance, if we take  $\mathsf{T} = \mathrm{Id}$ ), the effectiveness of the one-sample test in Algorithm 1 becomes questionable even for InD samples. A simple fix is then to run the two-sample version of the KS test in eq. (5), where  $F_{1}$  is the empirical distribution of the projected test samples while  $F_{2}$  is now the empirical distribution of the InD training samples. More concretely, in Algorithm 1 we additionally derive  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{train}} = \mathsf{T}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{train}})$  and project similarly to obtain  $\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{train}} = \mathbf{W}^{\top}\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{train}}$ . Then, in Line 5 we substitute the latent prior distribution (e.g. standard Gaussian) with the empirical distribution of the  $j$ -th row of  $\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{train}}$ . Below we call this modification as group OOD detection based on two-sample KS test (GOD2KS). We note that the computational complexity of GOD2KS remains similar to Algorithm 1, and it is equally flexible: we can now even take snapshots of  $\mathsf{T}$  obtained during training the flow model, and run GOD2KS on all of them.

# 3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed OOD detection algorithms with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) group OOD detection benchmarks, i.e. Typicality test (TyTest) (Nalisnick et al., 2019b) and the KL divergence based Out-of-Distribution Detection (KLOD) (Zhang et al., 2020). Implementation details of benchmarks are given in Appendix C. We test on two popular flow models: Glow (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018) and RealNVP (Dinh et al., 2017) (see Appendix B for more details about network architecture). For evaluation, we focus on the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), which is commonly used in OOD detection. We compare the OOD detection performance across a wide variety of image datasets, including grayscale and RGB image datasets (please refer to Appendix A for more details).

# 3.1 ROBUSTNESS OF GOD2KS

In Table 1 we compare the performance of GOD1KS and GOD2KS with the flow model RealNVP against the benchmark algorithms. For fair comparison, we adopt the same RealNVP model in the benchmarks. We use InD to denote the in-distribution dataset and OOD to denote different test datasets. To implement group OOD detection, we divide the test samples into small batches and vary the batch size for comparison. We use 50 random projections in all cases, and set it as the default for all experiments on RealNVP. As expected, the performance improves with the batch size (see Appendix F.3 for results with batch size 20). We observe that, the performance of the two benchmarks and our GOD1KS on these image datasets is unstable, and for some datasets the detection performance can be rather poor (i.e., AUROC below 0.5). For example, for TyTest with CIFAR-100 (InD) and CelebA (OOD), the AUROCs are 0.42 and 0.46; for KLOD with CIFAR-10 (InD) and SVHN (OOD), the AUROCs are 0.29 and 0.34. In contrast, the performance of our

Figure 4: Different divergences

GOD2KS is more robust and is generally satisfactory over all datasets. Results on Glow is shown in Table 5 in Appendix F.1. Again, our GOD2KS exhibits robustness over all datasets. Benchmarks also discuss detecting CIFAR-100 as OOD when training a model on CIFAR-10, and their AUROCs are around random guess. We did the same experiment and obtain similar results. The result is not surprising, since CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are similar datasets (both of them contain natural images, e.g. animals and vehicles), which highlights the need to quantify OOD-ness.

# 3.2 RANDOM PROJECTION VS. AUTOENCODERS

When the number of random projections is less than the input dimension, we essentially perform dimensionality reduction before comparing the distributions. Therefore, it is natural to compare with other dimensionality reduction methods such as autoencoders. To construct the benchmark, we first feed the input image to an autoencoder and then use the latent code from the encoder as the input in our GOD1KS/GOD2KS. The only difference is that with autoencoder we now skip the step of random projections. As an example, we use the Latent Space Autoregression (LSA) (Abati et al., 2019) as the autoencoder. Figure 3 shows the comparison results on FMNIST/MNIST (InD/OOD) and CIFAR-10/SVHN using RealNVP. The batch size is fixed as 10. We vary the number of random projections or the latent dimension from 20 to 400, and found that using random projections outperforms autoencoder with the same level of dimensionality reduction. It is possible to improve the detection performance with an autoencoder by using a more complex network than LSA. However, random projection is still appealing, as it works effectively and requires no extra networks.

# 3.3 EFFECT OF DIVERGENCE MEASURES

We empirically compare the KS test with the CvM test and the JS divergence (JSD). Both the KS and the CvM tests are non-parametric, while JSD requires the density to be estimated. We use the following heuristic approach to estimate the empirical density: dividing the latent values of the test batch into 20 bins, and use the normalized count in each bin as the empirical density (note that we can skip this step in both KS and CvM). Therefore, the computation time for calculating JSD is much longer. For implementation, we use the Scipy.stats library in Python to computation these measures. As an example, in Figure 4 we show results on one challenging dataset pair CIFAR-10/SVHN (InD/OOD) using RealNVP (results on Glow are similar). We consider two batch sizes: 10 and 20. The number of random projections is set to be 10 for all experiments. We can observe that JSD is outperformed by the other two in all cases, and the performance of KS and CvM is comparable. We further compare KS and CvM on more dataset pairs for different batch sizes (see Appendix F.2). The observation is generally consistent with KS being slightly superior to CvM, especially for the smaller batch size.

# 3.4 GENERATION QUALITY VS. OOD DETECTION

Intuitively, a more accurate flow model is expected to lead to better OOD detection performance. In this section, we investigate the relationship between the model accuracy and the OOD detection performance, where we measure a model's accuracy by its ability to generate visually realistic high-quality new images. To impose different levels of model accuracy we consider two factors: model capacity and training time. We fix the batch size to 10 in this experiment.

Model capacity: Consider Glow, where  $K$  denotes the number of steps of flow in each block,  $L$  denotes the number of blocks, and  $h$  denotes the number of hidden channels. For comparison we trained two different Glow models on CIFAR-10: (1) a simple Glow with  $K = 3$ ,  $L = 3$ ,  $h = 64$ , and (2) a complex Glow with  $K = 16$ ,  $L = 3$ ,  $h = 128$ . Figure 5 shows the comparison of the log-likelihood histograms and the generated images. We can see that while the histograms of the two log-likelihood are similar, the generation quality is noticeably different with the complex model generating much better images. We then run our OOD detection algorithms with SVHN as OOD. Surprisingly, we found that the simpler Glow yields better OOD detection performance. We also observed similar results with RealNVP (see Appendix F.4 for details).

Training time: In Figure 6, we show how the generation quality and the OOD detection performance evolve with training time. We use RealNVP with 16 blocks and 512 hidden channels trained on CelebA. Generally, more training time leads to a better model, which is indicated by the generation quality. Taking CIFAR-10 as OOD, we observe that the detection performance improves with training time. However, while we have similar observations on most dataset pairs, we still found some anomalies, e.g., Glow on CIFAR-10/SVHN and FMNIST/MNIST, where the detection performance fluctuates or even declines with the training time (see F.4).

We conclude that model accuracy, as measured by the generation quality in our experiments, is not always positively correlated with the OOD detection performance. These results confirm the findings of Zhang et al. (2021) on more models and more real datasets, and reveal the surprising phenomenon that a misestimated model can sometimes lead to better OOD detection.

# 3.5 DISTRIBUTION COMPARISON IN LATENT VS. SAMPLE SPACES

Instead of transforming the data into the latent space, we can directly apply our detection method to the raw inputs without training a flow model, i.e. set  $\mathsf{T} = \mathrm{Id}$ . Naturally, one wonders if it is necessary to use a flow model for OOD detection. Or, can we detect in the sample space directly? Thanks to the generality of our algorithm, we are positioned to report a fair comparison below.

When performing detection in the sample space directly with our method, we can only use the two-sample version due to the absence of the prior distribution. In this experiment, the batch size is fixed to be 10 and the number of random projections is fixed to be 50. We first run our GOD2KS (without the inverse transformation) in the sample space on image datasets, and compare with the detection results obtained in the latent space, as shown in Table 2. Interestingly, we found that detecting in the latent space is generally better than in the sample space, especially for SVHN/CIFAR-10, SVHN/CIFAR-100, and SVHN/CelebA.

Next, we examine the detection performance by varying the OOD distribution. To this end, we manually inject zero-mean Gaussian noise to the OOD data. The results are summarized in Table 3. We can see that the detection performance in the sample space varies with the OOD distribution, while that in the latent space is superior and stable. We hypothesize that the robustness of detection in the latent space can be attributed to the more regular structure of the latent prior distribution (i.e., Gaussian), which can be beneficial for distributional comparison.

# 4 RELATED WORK

OOD detection has been explored from different perspectives, e.g., discriminative methods, generative models, or hypothesis tests; see Toth & Chawla (2018); Pang et al. (2021) for extensive reviews. Below we only discuss papers on unsupervised methods using generative models.

Unsupervised group OOD detection Nalisnick et al. (2019b) propose the typicality test for group OOD detection under the hypothesis that the in-distribution samples are drawn from the typical set of the data distribution, which may not overlap with the regions of high density. This hypothesis is recently interrogated by Zhang et al. (2021), who instead attribute the failure of OOD detection in deep generative models to model misestimation. Moreover, Song et al. (2019) observe that batch normalization can lower the likelihood of a batch of OOD samples, based on which a permutation test is proposed for group OOD detection. Chalapathy et al. (2018) define a group reference function which aggregates the information of input groups and then suggests a distance score for OOD detection that measures the deviation between a test group and the group reference function. It's

worth mentioning that both Song et al. (2019) and Chalapathy et al. (2018) adopt a fixed and large batch size (64 and 1536, respectively) for all experiments, and thus it is not clear how the batch size (especially the smaller ones) would affect the detection performance. Our work is most related to Zhang et al. (2020), who also consider detection in the latent space of flow models. The main differences lie in three aspects: (1) they impose the Gaussian assumption on the latent distribution of test samples, so that they can compare it with the latent prior in a closed form using KL-divergence. In contrast, our KS test is non-parametric, hence does not require any distributional assumption on test data; (2) they assume the trained flow model is perfect, while we additionally provide GOD2KS for imperfect models; and (3) we use random projections to consider both marginal distribution and correlations of all dimensions, while they need to explicitly estimate the correlation coefficients to quantify the inter-dimensional correlations, which can be challenging in practice.

Unsupervised point OOD detection Compared to group OOD detection, point OOD detection treats test samples individually. In the context of deep generative models, many researchers have tried to explain the failure of log-likelihood for OOD detection from different perspectives, e.g., the background statistics (Ren et al., 2019), the inductive biases (Kirichenko et al., 2020), the input complexity (Serrà et al., 2020), and the model accuracy (Choi et al., 2018), and proposed new metrics therein. Our work can also be extended to point detection by artificially creating a batch of samples for each individual test sample (see Appendix E for more details).

Representation learning for OOD detection OOD detection is challenging in high dimensions. This motivates the study of representation learning, which aims to characterize discriminative information of the input with a reduced dimension for the OOD detection. Example methods include projection (Pevný, 2016; Pang et al., 2018), feature selection (Azmandian et al., 2012; Pang et al., 2017), and deep learning based methods. For the latter one, representations can be obtained either from a pre-trained model (Zhou et al., 2019; Pang et al., 2020; Andrews et al., 2016; Tudor Ionescu et al., 2017), or be directly learned with a neural network such as autoencoders (Xu et al., 2015; Ionescu et al., 2019; Erfani et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019). In our work, the representation is obtained by random projecting the latent space of flow models. Compared with other deep learning based approaches, our method requires no additional networks and is computationally more efficient.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this work, we re-examined the potential of flow models for OOD detection. We provided practical OOD detection algorithms that compare distributional information in the latent space and impose no parametric assumption. We compared with SOTA benchmarks and obtained comparable and more stable performances. Experimentally, we demonstrated the benefits of detecting OOD data in the latent space and confirmed that OOD detection performance is not always positively correlated with model accuracy. In the future, we would like to characterize OOD distributions that can be reliably detected by our methods, as well as the possibility of projecting onto high dimensional subspaces.
