# ABSTRACT

Reward function design and exploration time are arguably the biggest obstacles to the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the real world. In many real-world tasks, designing a suitable reward function takes considerable manual engineering and often requires additional and potentially visible sensors to be installed just to measure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore, many interesting tasks consist of multiple steps that must be executed in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be measured, it does not necessarily provide useful feedback on these implicit intermediate steps or sub-goals.

To address these issues, we propose leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual representations learned by deep models to quickly infer perceptual reward functions from small numbers of demonstrations. We present a method that is able to identify the key intermediate steps of a task from only a handful of demonstration sequences, and automatically identify the most discriminative features for identifying these steps. This method makes use of the features in a pre-trained deep model, but does not require any explicit sub-goal supervision. The resulting reward functions, which are dense and smooth, can then be used by an RL agent to learn to perform the task in real-world settings. To evaluate the learned reward functions, we present qualitative results on two real-world tasks and a quantitative evaluation against a human-designed reward function. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to learn a complex real-world door opening skill using a real robot, even when the demonstration used for reward learning is provided by a human using their own hand. To our knowledge, these are the first results showing that complex robotic manipulation skills can be learned directly and without supervised labels from a video of a human performing the task.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Social learning, such as imitation, plays a critical role in allowing humans and animals to quickly acquire complex skills in the real world. Humans can use this weak form of supervision to acquire behaviors from very small numbers of demonstrations, in sharp contrast to deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which typically require extensive training data. In this work, we make use of two ideas about imitation to develop a scalable and efficient imitation learning method: first, imitation makes use of extensive prior knowledge to quickly glean the "gist" of a new task from even a small number of demonstrations; second, imitation involves both observation and trial-and-error learning (RL). Building on these ideas, we propose a reward learning method for understanding the intent of a user demonstration through the use of pre-trained visual features, which provide the "prior knowledge" for efficient imitation. Our algorithm aims to discover not only the high-level goal of a task, but also the implicit sub-goals and steps that comprise more complex behaviors. Extracting such sub-goals can allow the agent to make maximal use of the information contained in the demonstration. Once the reward function has been extracted, the agent can use its own experience at the task to determine the physical structure of the behavior, even when the reward is provided by an agent with a substantially different embodiment (e.g. a human providing a demonstration for a robot).

Figure 1: Method overview. Given a few demonstration videos of the same action, our method discovers intermediate steps, then selects for each step the most discriminative features found in the mid and high-level representations of a pre-trained deep model. The selected features are then combined to produce a single reward function per step. These intermediate rewards are combined into a single reward function. The reward function is then used by a real robot to learn the perform the demonstrated task as show in 3.2.

To our knowledge, our method is the first reward learning technique that learns generalizable vision-based reward functions for complex robotic manipulation skills from only a few demonstrations provided directly by a human. Although prior methods have demonstrated reward learning with vision for real-world robotic tasks, they have either required kinesthetic demonstrations with robot state for reward learning (Finn et al., 2015), or else required low-dimensional state spaces and numerous demonstrations (Wulfmeier et al., 2016). The contributions of this paper are:

- A method for perceptual reward learning from only a few demonstrations of real-world tasks. Reward functions are dense and incremental, with automated unsupervised discovery of intermediate steps.  
- The first vision-based reward learning method that can learn a complex robotic manipulation task from a few human demonstrations in real-world robotic experiments.  
- A set of empirical experiments that show that the learned visual representations inside a pre-trained deep model are general enough to be directly used to represent goals and sub-goals for manipulation skills in new scenes without retraining.

# 1.1 RELATED WORK

Deep reinforcement learning and deep robotic learning work has previously examined learning reward functions based on images. One of the most common approaches to image-based reward functions is to directly specify a "target image" by showing the learner the raw pixels of a successful task completion state, and then using distance to that image (or its latent representation) as a reward function (Lange et al., 2012; Finn et al., 2015; Watter et al., 2015). However, this approach has several severe shortcomings. First, the use of a target image presupposes that the system can

achieve a substantially similar visual state, which precludes generalization to semantically similar but visually distinct situations. Second, the use of a target image does not provide the learner with information about which facet of the image is more or less important for task success, which might result in the learner excessively emphasizing irrelevant factors of variation (such as the color of a door due to light and shadow) at the expense of relevant factors (such as whether or not the door is open or closed). One potential solution to this is to employ inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), which analyzes a collection of demonstrations to learn a parsimonious reward function that explains the demonstrated behavior (Ng et al., 2000). A few recently proposed IRL algorithms have sought to combine IRL with vision and deep network representations (Finn et al., 2016; Wulfmeier et al., 2016). However, scaling IRL to high-dimensional systems and open-ended reward representations is very challenging. The previous work closest to ours used images together with robot state information (joint angles and end effector pose), with tens of demonstrations provided through kinesthetic teaching (Finn et al., 2016). In contrast, the approach we propose in this work is simple and efficient, can use demonstrations that consist of videos of a human performing the task using their own body, and can acquire reward functions with intermediate sub-goals using just a few examples. This kind of efficient vision-based reward learning from videos of humans has not been demonstrated in prior IRL work. The idea of perceptual reward functions using raw pixels was also explored by Edwards et al. (2016) which, while sharing the same spirit as this work, was limited to simple synthetic tasks and used single images as perceptual goals rather than multiple demonstration videos.

# 2 ALGORITHMS

The key insight in our approach is that we can exploit the semantically meaningful and powerful features in a pre-trained deep neural network to infer task goals and sub-goals using a very simple unsupervised temporal segmentation method, follow by feature selection. The pre-trained network effectively transfers prior knowledge about the visual world to make imitation learning fast and robust. As depicted in Fig. 1, our algorithm first segments the demonstrations into segments based on perceptual similarity, which corresponds to sub-goals or steps of the task. This segmentation, described in Section 2.1, is then used as a supervision signal for discriminative feature selection, described in Section 2.2, which produces a single perception reward function for each step of the task. The combined reward function can then be used with a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the demonstrated behavior. Although this method for extracting reward functions is exceedingly simple, its power comes from the use of highly general and robust pre-trained visual features, and our key empirical result is that such features are sufficient to acquire effective and generalizable reward functions for real-world manipulation skills.

We use the Inception network (Szegedy et al., 2015) pre-trained ImageNet classification (Deng et al., 2009) to obtain the visual features for representing the learned rewards. It is well known that visual features in such networks are quite general and can be reused for other visual tasks. However, it is less clear if sparse subsets of such features can be used directly to represent goals and sub-goals for real-world manipulation skills. Our experimental evaluation suggests that indeed they can, and that the resulting reward representations are robust and reliable enough for real-world robotic learning without any finetuning of the features. In this work, we use all activations starting from the first "mixed" layer that follows the first 5 convolutional layers (this layer's activation map is of size  $35 \times 35 \times 256$  given a  $299 \times 299$  input). While this paper focuses on visual perception, the approach is general and can be applied to other modalities (e.g. audio and tactile).

# 2.1 UNSUPERVISED DISCOVERY OF STEPS

The first stage in our method is to analyze a demonstration and segment it into intermediate steps or goals. In the case of multiple demonstrations, we process each one independently at this stage, and combine them only during feature selection in the next section. Though analyzing commonalities across demonstrations could in principle improve this step, we found it to be unnecessary in our prototype. To simplify the unsupervised segmentation phase, we take advantage of some constraints that are reasonable in a real-world setup: stable capture device (no large video motion); intermediate steps and their order are the same in all demonstrations; demonstrations are visually diverse enough to allow for disambiguation of the relevant features (e.g. varied backgrounds).

The goal of the segmentation phase is to find the splitting points in each sequence that minimize the average features variance simultaneously across all segments of a split (see Algorithm 1). Min-

imizing intra-segment variance in this way can also be formalized as maximum-likelihood fitting of per-segment independent Gaussian models. Intuitively, we aim to break down a sequence in a way that each frame of a sub-sequence is abstractly similar to each other. The algorithm computes the optimal splits for a given number of splits. One can iterate over the reasonable number of splits and decide which produces the best results for reproducing the task. A task can be decomposed at multiple degrees of granularity. Presumably, the higher the granularity the easier it is for a system to learn a task. For now we pick the granularity by hand, but we plan to explore automatic granularity selection in future work and its impact on learning efficiency across diverse tasks.

Algorithm 1 Recursive similarity maximization, where AverageStd() is a function that computes the average standard deviation over a set of frames or over a set of values,  $n$  is the number of splits desired and min_size is the minimum size of a split.

function SPLIT(video,start, end, n, min_size, prev_std = [];  
if  $n = 1$  then return [AVERAGESTD(video[ start : end]), ];  
end if  
min_std  $\leftarrow$  None  
min_split  $\leftarrow$  [None, None]  
for  $i\gets$  start + min_size to end - ((n-1) * min_size)) do  
std1, splits1  $\leftarrow$  SPLIT(video, start, i, 1, min_size)  
std2, splits2  $\leftarrow$  SPLIT(video, i, end, n-1, min_size, prev_std + std1)  
avg_std  $\leftarrow$  AVERAGESTD(prev_std + std1 + std2)  
if min_std = None or avg_std < min_std then  
min_std  $\leftarrow$  avg_std  
min_split  $\leftarrow$  [std1 + std2, [i] + splits2]  
end if  
end for  
return min_split

# 2.2 FEATURE SELECTION

The second stage in our method is to select the most relevant features for each segmented step or goal. Intent understanding requires identifying highly discriminative features of a specific goal while remaining invariant to unrelated variation (e.g. lighting, color, viewpoint). The relevant discriminative features may be very diverse and more or less abstract, which motivates our intuition to tap into the activations of deep models at different depths. Deep models cover a large set of representations that can be useful, from spatially dense and simple features in the lower layers (e.g. large collection of detected edges) to gradually more spatially sparse and abstract features (e.g. few object classes). We hypothesize that in mid to high-level features, there exists enough sparse independent features that can readily and compactly discriminate between a wide range of previously unseen inputs.

If we can identify the features that are most discriminative of a particular step, we construct a simple reward function in terms of the log-probability under a naive Bayes style model. Though such a model is exceedingly simple, it has the distinct advantage of treating each relevant feature independently, which dramatically reduces the risk of overfitting when the number of features is large and the number of demonstrations is extremely small.

To select the most discriminative features, we use a simple scoring heuristic. Each feature  $i$  is first normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of all training sequences. We then rank them for each sub-goal according to their distance  $z_{i}$  to the average statistics of the sets of positive and negative frames for a given goal:

$$
z _ {i} = \alpha \left| \mu_ {i} ^ {+} - \mu_ {i} ^ {-} \right| - \left(\sigma_ {i} ^ {+} + \sigma_ {i} ^ {-}\right) \tag {1}
$$

where  $\mu_i^+$  and  $\sigma_i^+$  are the mean and standard deviation of all "positive" frames and the  $\mu_i^-$  and  $\sigma_i^-$  of all "negative" frames (the frames that do not contain the sub-goal). Only the top- $n$  features are retained to form the reward function  $R_g()$  for their corresponding sub-goal, which is given by the

log-probability of an independent Gaussian distribution over the relevant features:

$$
R _ {g} (a) = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i} ^ {n} \frac {\left(a _ {i} - \mu_ {i} ^ {+}\right) ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {i} ^ {+}} \tag {2}
$$

where  $a$  a vector of activations corresponding to the top  $n$  selected features. This model resembles naive Bayes. We empirically choose  $\alpha = 5.0$  and  $n = 32$  for our subsequent experiments. This procedure provides us with one reward function per step, and we can combine these into a single reward function where later steps yield higher reward than earlier steps, as described in Appendix A.1.

# 2.3 USING PERCEPTUAL REWARDS FOR ROBOTIC LEARNING

In order to use our learned perceptual reward functions in a complete skill learning system, we must also choose a reinforcement learning algorithm and a policy representation. While in principle any reinforcement learning algorithm could be suitable for this task, we chose a method that is efficient enough to evaluate on real-world robotic systems in order to validate our approach. The method we use is based on the  $\mathrm{PI}^2$  reinforcement learning algorithm (Theodorou et al., 2010). Our implementation, which is discussed in more detail in Appendix A.2, uses a relatively simple linear-Gaussian parameterization of the policy, which corresponds to a sequence of open-loop torque commands with fixed linear feedback to correct for perturbations. This method also requires initialization from example demonstrations to learn complex manipulation tasks efficiently. A more complex neural network policy could also be used (Chebotar et al., 2016), and more sophisticated RL algorithms could also learn skills without demonstration initialization. However, since the main purpose of this component is to validate the learned reward functions, we used this simple approach to test our rewards quickly and efficiently.

# 3 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we discuss our empirical evaluation, starting with an analysis of the learned reward functions in terms of both qualitative reward structure and quantitative segmentation accuracy. We then present results for a real-world validation of our method on robotic door opening.

# 3.1 PERCEPTUAL REWARDS EVALUATION

We report results on two demonstrated tasks: door opening and liquid pouring. We collected about a dozen training videos for each task using a smart phone. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the entire training set used for the pouring task.

![](images/115582878e6729b1bcc21529522fa949cb7dff7128b9d9443bb1b2a338c4c54a.jpg)  
Figure 2: Entire training set for the pouring task (11 demonstrations).

# 3.1.1 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS

While a door opening sensor can be engineered using sensors hidden in the door, measuring pouring or container tilting would be quite complicated, would visually alter the scene, and is unrealistic for learning in the wild. Visual reward functions are therefore an excellent choice for complex physical phenomena such as liquid pouring. In Fig. 3, we present the combined reward functions for test

videos on the pouring task, and Fig. 9 shows the intermediate rewards for each sub-goal. We plot the predicted reward functions for both successful and failed task executions in Fig. 10. We observe that for "missed" executions where the task is only partially performed, the intermediate steps are correctly classified. Fig. 8 details qualitative results of unsupervised step segmentation for the door opening and pouring tasks. For the door task, the 2-segments splits are often quite in line with what one can expect, while a 3-segments split is less accurate. We also observe that the method is robust to the presence or absence of the handle on the door, as well as its opening direction. We find that for the pouring task, the 4-segments split often yields the most sensible break down. It is interesting to note that the 2-segment split usually occurs when the glass is about half full.

Figure 3: Examples of "pouring" reward functions. We show here a few successful examples, see Fig. 10 for results on the entire test set. In 3a we observe a continuous and incremental reward as the task progresses and saturating as it is completed. 3b increases as the bottle appears but successfully detects that the task is not completed, while in 3c it successfully detects that the action is already completed from the start.

# 3.1.2 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

We evaluate the quantitative accuracy of the unsupervised steps discovery in Table 1, while Table 2 presents quantitative generalization results for the learned reward on a test video of each task. For each video, ground truth intermediate steps were provided by human supervision for the purpose of evaluation. While this ground truth is subjective, since each task can be broken down in multiple ways, it is reasonably consistent for the simple tasks in our experiments. We use the Jaccard similarity measure (intersection over union) to indicate how much a detected step overlaps with its corresponding ground truth.

Table 1: Unsupervised steps discovery accuracy (Jaccard overlap on training sets) versus the ordered random steps baseline.  

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">dataset (training)</td><td rowspan="2">method</td><td colspan="3">2 steps</td><td colspan="4">3 steps</td></tr><tr><td>step 1</td><td>step 2</td><td>average</td><td>step 1</td><td>step 2</td><td>step 3</td><td>average</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">door</td><td>ordered random steps</td><td>59.4%</td><td>45.6%</td><td>52.5%</td><td>48.0%</td><td>58.1%</td><td>60.1%</td><td>55.4%</td></tr><tr><td>unsupervised steps</td><td>84.0%</td><td>68.1%</td><td>76.1%</td><td>57.6%</td><td>75.1%</td><td>68.1%</td><td>66.9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">pouring</td><td>ordered random steps</td><td>65.2%</td><td>66.6%</td><td>65.9%</td><td>46.2%</td><td>46.3%</td><td>66.3%</td><td>52.9%</td></tr><tr><td>unsupervised steps</td><td>92.3%</td><td>90.5%</td><td>91.6%</td><td>79.7%</td><td>48.0%</td><td>48.6%</td><td>58.8%</td></tr></table>

In Table 1, we compare our method against a random baseline. Because we assume the same step order in all demonstrations, we also order the random steps in time to provide a fair baseline. Note that the random baseline performs fairly well because the steps are distributed somewhat uniformly in time. Should the steps be much less temporally uniform, the random baseline would be expected to perform very poorly, while our method should maintain similar performance. We compare splitting between 2 and 3 steps and find that, for both tasks, 2 steps are easier to discover, probably because these tasks exhibit one strong visual change each while the other steps are more subtle. Note that our unsupervised segmentation only works when full sequences are available while our learned reward functions can be used in real-time without accessing future frames. Hence in these experiments we evaluate the unsupervised segmentation on the training set only and evaluate the reward functions on the test set.

In Table 2, we evaluate the reward functions individually for each step on the test set. For that purpose, we binarize the reward function using a threshold of 0.5. The random baseline simply outputs true or false at each timestep. We observe that the learned rewards outperform the baseline by about a factor of 2. It is not clear exactly what level of accuracy is required to successfully learn

to perform these tasks, but we show in section 3.2.2 that the reward accuracy on the door task is sufficient to reach  $100\%$  success rate with a real robot.

# 3.2 REAL-WORLD ROBOTIC DOOR OPENING

In this section, we aim to answer the question of whether our previously visualized reward function can be used to learn a real-world robotic motion skill. We experiment on a door opening skill, where we adapt a demonstrated door opening to a novel configuration, such as different position or orientation of the door. Following the experimental protocol in prior work (Chebotar et al., 2016), we adapt an imperfect kinesthetic demonstration which we ensure succeeds at least occasionally (about  $10\%$  of the time). These demonstrations consist only of robot poses, and do not include images. We then use a variety of different video demonstrations, which contain images but not robot poses, to learn the reward function. These videos include demonstrations with other doors, and even demonstrations provided by a human using their own body, rather than through kinesthetic teaching with the robot.

Figure 4 shows the experimental setup. We use a 7-DoF robotic arm with a two-finger gripper, and a camera placed above the shoulder, which provides monocular RGB images. For our baseline  $\mathrm{PI}^2$  policy, we closely follow the setup of Chebotar et al. (2016) which uses an IMU sensor in the door handle to provide both a cost and feed

back as part of the state of the controller. In contrast, in our approach we remove this sensor both from the state representation provided to  $\mathrm{PI}^2$  and in our reward replace the target IMU state with the output of a deep neural network.

Figure 4: Robot arm setup. Note that our method does not make use of the sensor on the back handle of the door, but it is used in our comparison to train a baseline method with the ground truth reward.

Figure 5: Rewards from human demonstration only. Here we show the rewards produced when trained on humans only (see Fig. 11). In 5a, we show the reward on a human test video. In 5b, we show what the reward produces when the human hands misses opening the door. In 5c, we show the reward successfully saturates when the robot opens the door even though it has not seen a robot arm before. Similarly in 5d and 5e we show it still works with some amount of variation of the door which was not seen during training (white door and black handle, blue door, rotations of the door).

# 3.2.1 DATA

We experiment with a range of different demonstrations from which we derive our reward function, varying both the source demo (human vs robotic), the number of subgoals we extract, and the appearance of the door. We record monocular RGB images on a camera placed above the shoulder of the arm. The door is cropped from the images, and then the resulting image is re-sized such that the shortest side is 299 dimensional with preserved aspect ratio. The input into our convolutional feature extractor Szegedy et al. (2015) is the  $299 \times 299$  center crop.

# 3.2.2 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS

We evaluate our reward functions qualitatively by plotting our perceptual reward functions below the demonstrations with a variety of door types and demonstrators (e.g. robot or human). As can be seen in Fig. 5 and in real experiments Fig. 6, we show that the reward functions are useful to a robotic arm while only showing human demonstrations as depicted in Fig. 11. Moreover we exhibit robustness variations in appearance.

# 3.2.3 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

In comparing the success rate of visual reward versus a baseline  $\mathrm{PI}^2$  method that uses the ground truth reward function obtained by instrumenting the door with an IMU. We run  $\mathrm{PI}^2$  for 11 iterations with 10 sampled trajectories at each iteration. As can be seen in Fig. 6, we obtain similar convergence speeds to our baseline model, with our method also able to open the door consistently. Since our local policy is able to obtain high reward candidate trajectories, this is strong evidence that a perceptual reward could be used to train a global in same manner as Chebotar et al. (2016).

Figure 6: Door opening success rate at each iteration of learning on the real robot. The  $\mathrm{PI}^2$  baseline method uses a ground truth reward function obtained by instrumenting the door. Note that rewards learned by our method, even from videos of humans or different doors, learn comparably or faster when compared to the ground truth reward.

# 4 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we present a method for automatically identifying important intermediate goal given a few visual demonstrations of a task. By leveraging the general features learned from pretrained deep models, we propose a method for rapidly learning an incremental reward function from human demonstrations which we successfully demonstrate on a real robotic learning task.

A compelling direction for future work is to explore how reward learning algorithms can be combined with robotic lifelong learning. One of the biggest barriers for lifelong learning in the real world is the ability of an agent to obtain reward supervision, without which no learning is possible. Continuous learning using unsupervised rewards promises to substantially increase the variety and diversity of experience that is available for robotic reinforcement learning, resulting in more powerful, robust, and general robotic skills.
