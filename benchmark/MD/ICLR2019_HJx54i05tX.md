# ABSTRACT

We study the behavior of weight-tied multilayer vanilla autoencoders under the assumption of random weights. Via an exact characterization in the limit of large dimensions, our analysis reveals interesting phase transition phenomena when the depth becomes large. This, in particular, provides quantitative answers and insights to three questions that were yet fully understood in the literature. Firstly, we provide a precise answer on how the random deep weight-tied autoencoder model performs "approximate inference" as posed by Scellier et al. (2018), and its connection to reversibility considered by several theoretical studies. Secondly, we show that deep autoencoders display a higher degree of sensitivity to perturbations in the parameters, distinct from the shallow counterparts. Thirdly, we obtain insights on pitfalls in training initialization practice, and demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to train a deep autoencoder, even with the tanh activation and a depth as large as 200 layers, without resorting to techniques such as layer-wise pre-training or batch normalization. Our analysis is not specific to any depths or any Lipschitz activations, and our analytical techniques may have broader applicability.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

The autoencoder is a cornerstone in machine learning, first as a response to the unsupervised learning problem (Rumelhart & Zipser (1985)), then with applications to dimensionality reduction (Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2006)), unsupervised pre-training (Erhan et al. (2010)), and also as a precursor to many modern generative models (Goodfellow et al. (2016)). Its reconstruction power is well utilized in applications such as anomaly detection (Chandola et al. (2009)) and image recovery (Mousavi et al. (2015)). With the surge of deep learning, thousands of papers have studied multilayer variants of this architecture, but theoretical understanding has been limited, since analyzing the learning dynamics of a highly nonlinear structure is typically a difficult problem even for the shallow autoencoder. To get around this, we tackle the task with a critical assumption: the weights are random and the autoencoder is weight-tied. One enjoys much analytical tractability from the randomness assumption, whereas weight tying enforces the random autoencoder to perform "autoencoding". We also study this in the high-dimensional setting, where all dimensions are comparably large and ideally jointly approaching infinity. We consider the simplest setting: vanilla autoencoders (i.e., ones with fully connected layers only) and their reconstruction capability. This is done for the sake of understanding the effect of depth, while we note our techniques may have broader applicability.

The aforementioned assumptions are not without justifications. There is a growing literature on deep neural networks with random weights, (Li & Saad (2018); Giryes et al. (2016); Poole et al. (2016); Schoenholz et al. (2016); Gabrie et al. (2018); Amari et al. (2018)) to name a few, revealing certain properties of deep feedforward networks<sup>1</sup>. Several recent works have also studied random multilayer feedforward networks through the lens of statistical inference (Manoel et al. (2017);

Reeves (2017); Fletcher et al. (2018)). The idea of weight tying is considered in the important paper Vincent et al. (2010) with an empirical finding that autoencoders with and without weight tying perform comparably. Similar features of random connection and symmetry also appear in other neural models (Lillicrap et al. (2016); Scellier et al. (2018)). Finally the high-dimensional setting is common in recent statistical learning advances (Buhlmann & Van De Geer (2011)), and not too far from the actual practice where many large datasets have dimensions of at least a few hundreds and are harnessed by large-scaled models.

We seek quantitative answers to three specific questions that are motivated by previous works:

- In exactly what way does the (vanilla) random weight-tied autoencoder perform "approximate inference"? This term is coined in Scellier et al. (2018) in connection with the theoretical results in Arora et al. (2015), which implicitly studies the said model. In particular, Arora et al. (2015) proves an upper bound on  $\| \hat{\pmb{x}} - \pmb{x} \|^2$ , where  $\pmb{x}$  and  $\hat{\pmb{x}}$  are the input and the output of the network, but is limited in the number of layers and specific to the ReLU activation. This direction has been recently extended by Gilbert et al. (2017). In our work, we establish precisely what this approximate inference is by obtaining a general and asymptotically exact characterization of  $\hat{\pmb{x}}$ , for any number of layers and any Lipschitz continuous activations (Theorem 1 and Section 3.3). Theorem 1 is the key theoretical result of our work and lays the foundation for all analyses that follow.  
- In what way is the deep autoencoder different from the shallow counterpart? Li & Saad (2018); Poole et al. (2016) reveal this in terms of the candidate function space and expressivity for feedforward networks. It is unclear how these notions are applicable to weight-tied autoencoders, which seek replication of the input rather than a generic mapping. In this work, we show that the deep autoencoder exhibits a higher order of sensitivity to perturbations of the parameters (Section 3.4).  
- Does it have any implications to the training practice? Many recent works $^{3}$  Glorot & Bengio (2010); He et al. (2015); Schoenholz et al. (2016); Pennington et al. (2017); Yang & Schoenholz (2017); Xiao et al. (2018); Chen et al. (2018); Hayou et al. (2018); Hanin & Rolnick (2018); Hanin (2018); Burkholz & Dubatovka (2018) demonstrate a connection between the study of random networks, or ones at initialization, and their trainability. Note that these works either do not study weight-tied structures, or assume the analysis of the untying case for weight-tied structures. In our work, we derive and experimentally verify insights on how (not) to initialize deep weight-tied autoencoders, demonstrating that it is possible to train them without resorting to techniques such as greedy layer-wise pretraining, drop-out and batch normalization (Section 3.5). Specifically we experiment with 200-layer autoencoders.

No prior works have attempted all three tasks. The quantitative difference between weight-tied and weight-untied networks is in fact not negligible, yet the analysis is non-trivial due to the weight tying constraint (Arora et al. (2015); Chen et al. (2018)). To address this issue and obtain Theorem 1, we apply the Gaussian conditioning technique, which first appears in the studies of TAP equations in spin glass theory (Bolthausen (2014)) and is extensively used in the approximate message passing algorithm literature (Bayati & Montanari (2011); Javanmard & Montanari (2013); Berthier et al. (2017)). This should be contrasted with untied random networks, whose analysis is typically more straightforward. More importantly, the difference is not only analytical: the overall picture of deep random weight-tied autoencoders is rich and drastically different from that of feedforward networks. An analysis in the limit of infinite depth reveals three fundamental equations governing the picture (Section 3.1), which displays multiple phase transition phenomena (Section 3.2).

Finally let us quickly mention other recent theoretical works on autoencoders: Arora et al. (2014); Arpit et al. (2015); Rangamani et al. (2017); Nguyen et al. (2018) studying the learned autoencoders in specific settings, Baldi (2012); Alain & Bengio (2014); Bengio et al. (2013) taking a framework where the encoder and the decoder are generic mappings, and Le Roux & Bengio (2008); Sutskever

& Hinton (2008); Montufar & Ay (2011) exploring representational properties of related architectures. These works head in different directions from ours.

# 2 SETTING AND MAIN THEOREM

# 2.1 SETTING AND ASSUMPTIONS

Consider the following  $2L$ -layers autoencoder with weight tying:

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {x}} = \varphi_ {0} \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {1} ^ {\top} \varphi_ {1} \left(\dots \varphi_ {L - 1} \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {L} ^ {\top} \varphi_ {L} \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {L} \sigma_ {L - 1} \left(\dots \sigma_ {1} \left(\boldsymbol {W} _ {1} \sigma_ {0} (\boldsymbol {x}) + \boldsymbol {b} _ {1}\right) + \dots\right) + \boldsymbol {b} _ {L}\right) + \boldsymbol {v} _ {L}\right) + \dots\right) + \boldsymbol {v} _ {1}\right).
$$

Here  $\pmb{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_0}$  is the input,  $W_{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{\ell} \times n_{\ell-1}}$  is the weight,  $\pmb{b}_{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{\ell}}$  is the encoder bias, and  $\pmb{v}_{\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{\ell-1}}$  is the decoder bias, for  $\ell = 1, \dots, L$ . Also  $\varphi_{\ell}: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  and  $\sigma_{\ell}: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  are the activations (where for a vector  $\pmb{u} \in \mathbb{R}^n$  and a function  $\varphi: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ , we write  $\varphi(\pmb{u})$  to denote the vector  $(\varphi(u_1), \dots, \varphi(u_n))^{\top}$ ). It is usually the case in practice that  $\sigma_0(\pmb{u}) = \pmb{u}$  the identity function. We introduce some convenient quantities inductively:

$$
\boldsymbol {x} _ {0} = \boldsymbol {x}, \quad \boldsymbol {x} _ {\ell} = \boldsymbol {W} _ {\ell} \sigma_ {\ell - 1} \left(\boldsymbol {x} _ {\ell - 1}\right) + \boldsymbol {b} _ {\ell}, \quad \ell = 1, \dots , L,
$$

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {x}} _ {L} = \boldsymbol {W} _ {L} ^ {\top} \varphi_ {L} (\boldsymbol {x} _ {L}) + \boldsymbol {v} _ {L}, \quad \hat {\boldsymbol {x}} _ {\ell} = \boldsymbol {W} _ {\ell} ^ {\top} \varphi_ {\ell} (\hat {\boldsymbol {x}} _ {\ell + 1}) + \boldsymbol {v} _ {\ell}, \quad \ell = L - 1, \dots , 1.
$$

Note that  $\hat{\pmb{x}} = \varphi_0(\hat{\pmb{x}}_1)$ . We assume weights are random. Specifically we generate the weights and biases according to

$$
(\boldsymbol {W} _ {\ell}) _ {i j} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(0, \frac {\sigma_ {W , \ell} ^ {2}}{n _ {\ell - 1}}\right) \mathrm {i . i . d .}, \quad (\boldsymbol {b} _ {\ell}) _ {i} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(0, \sigma_ {b, \ell} ^ {2}\right) \mathrm {i . i . d .}, \quad (\boldsymbol {v} _ {\ell}) _ {i} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(0, \sigma_ {v, \ell} ^ {2}\right) \mathrm {i . i . d .}.
$$

independently of each other. The scaling of the variances accords with the literature and actual practice (Glorot & Bengio (2010); Vincent et al. (2010)). We also consider the asymptotic high-dimensional regime, indexed by  $n$ :

$$
n _ {\ell} = n _ {\ell} \left(n\right), \quad \frac {n _ {\ell}}{n _ {\ell - 1}} \rightarrow \alpha_ {\ell} > 0 \text {a n d} n _ {\ell} \rightarrow \infty \text {a s} n \rightarrow \infty , \quad \forall \ell .
$$

Here  $\sigma_{W,\ell}$ ,  $\sigma_{b,\ell}$ ,  $\sigma_{v,\ell}$  and  $\alpha_{\ell}$  are finite constants independent of  $n$ . We enforce  $\sigma_{W,\ell} > 0$ , but allow  $\sigma_{b,\ell}$  and  $\sigma_{v,\ell}$  to be zero. We assume that all activations are Lipschitz continuous, and the encoder activations  $\sigma_{\ell}$ 's are non-trivial in the sense that for any  $\tau > 0$ ,  $\mathbb{E}_z\left\{\sigma_\ell (\tau z)^2\right\} > 0$  where  $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . We also assume that  $\frac{1}{n_0}\|\sigma_0(\pmb{x})\|^2$  tends to a finite and strictly positive constant as  $n \to \infty$ . We refer to Appendix A for more clarifications of notations.

# 2.2 MAIN THEOREM

In order to state the result, we need to define some scalar sequences. First we define  $\{\tau_{\ell}\}_{\ell = 1,\dots ,L}$  and  $\{\bar{\tau}_{\ell}\}_{\ell = 0,\dots ,L}$  inductively:

$$
\bar {\tau} _ {0} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{n _ {0}} \left\| \sigma_ {0} (x) \right\| ^ {2}, \qquad \bar {\tau} _ {\ell} ^ {2} = \tau_ {\ell} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {b, \ell} ^ {2}, \quad \ell = 1, \dots , L,
$$

$$
\tau_ {1} ^ {2} = \sigma_ {W, 1} ^ {2} \bar {\tau} _ {0} ^ {2}, \qquad \qquad \qquad \tau_ {\ell} ^ {2} = \sigma_ {W, \ell} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} _ {z} \left\{\sigma_ {\ell - 1} \left(\bar {\tau} _ {\ell - 1} z\right) ^ {2} \right\}, \quad \ell = 2, \dots , L,
$$

for  $z\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . Next, we define  $\{\gamma_{\ell},\rho_{\ell}\}_{\ell = 2,\ldots ,L + 1}$  inductively:

$$
\gamma_ {L + 1} = \frac {1}{\bar {\tau} _ {L} ^ {2}} \mathbb {E} _ {z _ {1}} \left\{\bar {\tau} _ {L} z _ {1} \varphi_ {L} \left(\bar {\tau} _ {L} z _ {1}\right) \right\}, \quad \rho_ {L + 1} = \mathbb {E} _ {z _ {1}} \left\{\varphi_ {L} \left(\bar {\tau} _ {L} z _ {1}\right) ^ {2} \right\},
$$

$$
\gamma_ {\ell} = \frac {1}{\bar {\tau} _ {\ell - 1} ^ {2}} \mathbb {E} _ {z _ {1}, z _ {2}} \left\{\bar {\tau} _ {\ell - 1} z _ {1} \varphi_ {\ell - 1} \left(\alpha_ {\ell} \sigma_ {W, \ell} ^ {2} \gamma_ {\ell + 1} \sigma_ {\ell - 1} (\bar {\tau} _ {\ell - 1} z _ {1}) + \sqrt {\alpha_ {\ell} \sigma_ {W , \ell} ^ {2} \rho_ {\ell + 1} + \sigma_ {v , \ell} ^ {2}} z _ {2}\right) \right\},
$$

$$
\rho_ {\ell} = \mathbb {E} _ {z _ {1}, z _ {2}} \left\{\varphi_ {\ell - 1} \left(\alpha_ {\ell} \sigma_ {W, \ell} ^ {2} \gamma_ {\ell + 1} \sigma_ {\ell - 1} (\bar {\tau} _ {\ell - 1} z _ {1}) + \sqrt {\alpha_ {\ell} \sigma_ {W , \ell} ^ {2} \rho_ {\ell + 1} + \sigma_ {v , \ell} ^ {2}} z _ {2}\right) ^ {2} \right\}, \quad \ell = L - 1, \dots , 2,
$$

for  $z_{1},z_{2}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$  independently. With these sequences defined, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 1. Consider the settings and assumptions as in Section 2.1, and the sequences  $\{\tau_{\ell},\bar{\tau}_{\ell}\}$  and  $\{\gamma_{\ell},\rho_{\ell}\}$  defined as above. Then in the limit  $n\to \infty^4$  ..

(a)  $\{\bar{\tau}_{\ell}\}$  describes the behavior of the encoder output  $\pmb{x}_{\ell}$ :

$$
\boldsymbol {x} _ {\ell} \cong \bar {\tau} _ {\ell} \boldsymbol {z}, \quad \ell = 1, \dots , L,
$$

$$
f o r \mathbf {z} \sim \mathcal {N} \left(0, \mathbf {I} _ {n _ {\ell}}\right).
$$

(b)  $\{\bar{\tau}_{\ell},\gamma_{\ell},\rho_{\ell}\}$  describes the behavior of the decoder output  $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\ell}$ :

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {x}} _ {\ell} \cong \alpha_ {\ell} \sigma_ {W, \ell} ^ {2} \gamma_ {\ell + 1} \sigma_ {\ell - 1} (\bar {\tau} _ {\ell - 1} \boldsymbol {z} _ {1}) + \sqrt {\alpha_ {\ell} \sigma_ {W , \ell} ^ {2} \rho_ {\ell + 1} + \sigma_ {v , \ell} ^ {2}} \boldsymbol {z} _ {2}, \quad \ell = 2, \dots , L,
$$

for  $z_1, z_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_{n_{\ell-1}})$  independently. One can replace  $\bar{\tau}_{\ell-1}z_1$  with  $x_{\ell-1}$  in the above, with  $z_2$  independent of  $x_{\ell-1}$ , in which case the statement also holds for  $\ell = 1$  with  $x_0 = x$ .

(c) For the autoencoder's output  $\hat{\pmb{x}}$

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {x}} \cong \varphi_ {0} \left(\alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {W, 1} ^ {2} \gamma_ {2} \sigma_ {0} (\boldsymbol {x}) + \sqrt {\alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {W , 1} ^ {2} \rho_ {2} + \sigma_ {v , 1} ^ {2}} \boldsymbol {z} _ {2}\right),
$$

for  $\pmb{z}_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_{n_0})$  independent of  $\pmb{x}$ .

The proof of the theorem, as well as an outline of the key ideas, are in Appendix A. The theorem says that  $\boldsymbol{x}_{\ell}$ ,  $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_{\ell}$  and  $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}$  admit simple descriptions which are tracked by scalar sequences  $\{\bar{\tau}_{\ell}, \gamma_{\ell}, \rho_{\ell}\}$ . Hence we can learn about the autoencoder by analyzing  $\{\bar{\tau}_{\ell}, \gamma_{\ell}, \rho_{\ell}\}$ , which is generally a simpler task than studying  $\boldsymbol{x}_{\ell}$ ,  $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_{\ell}$  and  $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}$  directly. Numerical simulations in Appendix B suggest that, although the theorem's statement is in the infinite dimension limit, the agreement is already good for dimensions of a few hundreds. We note that while the theorem assumes Gaussian biases, the same proof technique allows to obtain a similar result with a more relaxed condition on the biases.

Remark 2. While the theorem is specific to  $W_{\ell}$  following the Gaussian distribution, simulations in Appendix B suggest that the conclusion holds for a much broader class of distributions. We conjecture that it should hold so long as each  $W_{\ell}$  has i.i.d. entries and is independent of each other, its distribution has bounded  $k$ -th moment for some sufficiently large  $k$ , and the activations as well as the input  $x$  satisfy certain mild regularity conditions.

Remark 3. We comment on the range of  $\rho_{\ell}$  and  $\gamma_{\ell}$ . We have  $\rho_{\ell} \geq 0$ , which is obvious, and if  $\| \varphi_{\ell - 1} \|_{\infty} \leq C$ , then  $\rho_{\ell} \leq C^2$ . By Stein's lemma (cf. Appendix E.2),

$$
\gamma_ {L + 1} = \mathbb {E} _ {z} \left\{\varphi_ {L} ^ {\prime} \left(\bar {\tau} _ {L} z _ {1}\right) \right\},
$$

$$
\gamma_ {\ell} = \alpha_ {\ell} \sigma_ {W, \ell} ^ {2} \gamma_ {\ell + 1} \mathbb {E} _ {z _ {1}, z _ {2}} \left\{\varphi_ {\ell - 1} ^ {\prime} \left(\alpha_ {\ell} \sigma_ {W, \ell} ^ {2} \gamma_ {\ell + 1} \sigma_ {\ell - 1} (\bar {\tau} _ {\ell - 1} z _ {1}) + \sqrt {\alpha_ {\ell} \sigma_ {W , \ell} ^ {2} \rho_ {\ell + 1} + \sigma_ {v , \ell} ^ {2}} z _ {2}\right) \sigma_ {\ell - 1} ^ {\prime} (\bar {\tau} _ {\ell - 1} z _ {1}) \right\}.
$$

If the activations are non-decreasing, then  $\gamma_{\ell} \geq 0$ . Furthermore, if the activations are Lipschitz, then  $|\gamma_{\ell}| \leq Cc^{\ell}$  for some constants  $C$  and  $c$ .

# 3 AN ANALYSIS AT INFINITE DEPTH

In the following, we adopt a semi-rigorous approach, with an emphasis on the overall picture.

# 3.1 INFINITE DEPTH SIMPLIFICATION

We make several analytical simplifications. First consider  $\alpha_{\ell} = \alpha > 0$ ,  $\sigma_{W,\ell}^{2} = \sigma_{W}^{2} > 0$ ,  $\sigma_{b,\ell}^{2} = \sigma_{b}^{2} \geq 0$ ,  $\varphi_{\ell} = \varphi$  and  $\sigma_{\ell} = \sigma$  all independent of  $\ell$ , except for  $\varphi_{L}$  which is chosen separately (but we shall see that the specific choice of  $\varphi_{L}$  is largely immaterial). We also assume that  $\sigma_{v,\ell}^{2} = 0$ , and  $\sigma_{0}$  and  $\varphi_{0}$  are the identity<sup>5</sup>. We introduce a parameter  $\bar{\tau} \geq 0$ , whose role will be clear shortly, and

which satisfies:

$$
\bar {\tau} ^ {2} = T \left(\bar {\tau} ^ {2}\right) \equiv T \left(\bar {\tau} ^ {2}; \sigma_ {W} ^ {2}, \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}, \sigma\right), \quad T \left(\bar {\tau} ^ {2}\right) = \sigma_ {W} ^ {2} \mathbb {E} \left\{\sigma (\bar {\tau} z) ^ {2} \right\} + \sigma_ {b} ^ {2}, \tag {1}
$$

for  $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ . Note that this implies  $\sigma_W^2 \leq \sigma_{W,\max}^2 = \bar{\tau}^2 / \mathbb{E}\left\{\sigma (\bar{\tau} z)^2\right\}$ . If this cannot be satisfied, we set  $\bar{\tau}^2 = +\infty$ . In addition, let  $\beta = \alpha \sigma_W^2 > 0$ . With these, let us consider the following two fixed point equations:

$$
\gamma = G \left(\gamma , \rho\right) \equiv G \left(\gamma , \rho ; \beta , \bar {\tau} ^ {2}, \sigma , \varphi\right), \qquad G \left(\gamma , \rho\right) = \frac {1}{\bar {\tau} ^ {2}} \mathbb {E} \left\{\bar {\tau} z _ {1} \varphi \left(\beta \gamma \sigma \left(\bar {\tau} z _ {1}\right) + \sqrt {\beta \rho} z _ {2}\right) \right\}, (2)
$$

$$
\rho = R (\gamma , \rho) \equiv R (\gamma , \rho ; \beta , \bar {\tau} ^ {2}, \sigma , \varphi), \qquad R (\gamma , \rho) = \mathbb {E} \left\{\varphi (\beta \gamma \sigma (\bar {\tau} z _ {1}) + \sqrt {\beta \rho} z _ {2}) ^ {2} \right\}, \qquad (3)
$$

for  $z_{1},z_{2}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$  independently. Then Eq. (1), (2) and (3) together form the fundamental equations for deep random weight-tied autoencoders, in either one of the following senses:

Interpretation 1. For  $1 \ll \ell \ll L$ , in the limit  $L \to \infty$  (and  $\ell \to \infty$  at a pace sufficiently slow compared to  $L$ ), we have  $\bar{\tau}_{\ell} \to \bar{\tau}$ ,  $\gamma_{\ell} \to \gamma$  and  $\rho_{\ell} \to \rho$ , where  $\bar{\tau}$  is a stable fixed point solution to  $\bar{\tau}^2 = T(\bar{\tau}^2)$ , and  $(\gamma, \rho)$  is then jointly a stable fixed point solution to  $\gamma = G(\gamma, \rho)$  and  $\rho = R(\gamma, \rho)$ . In light of Theorem 1,  $(\bar{\tau}, \gamma, \rho)$  describes the behavior of an intermediate  $\hat{x}_{\ell}$ :

$$
\hat {\pmb {x}} _ {\ell} \cong S _ {\mathrm {s i g}} \sigma (\pmb {x} _ {\ell - 1}) + S _ {\mathrm {v a r}} \pmb {z}, S _ {\mathrm {s i g}} = \beta \gamma , S _ {\mathrm {v a r}} = \sqrt {\beta \rho},
$$

where  $z \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, I_{n_{\ell-1}}\right)$  independent of  $x_{\ell-1}$ , and  $x_{\ell-1} \cong \bar{\tau} z'$  for  $z' \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, I_{n_{\ell-1}}\right)$ . If the convergences  $\bar{\tau}_{\ell} \to \bar{\tau}$ ,  $\gamma_{\ell} \to \gamma$  and  $\rho_{\ell} \to \rho$  are fast, then the majority of the intermediate layers are well approximately described by the above, in the regime of large  $L$ .

Interpretation 2. Suppose that for  $\bar{\tau}_0 = \| \pmb{x}\| /\sqrt{n_0}$ , we impose the constraint  $\bar{\tau}_0^2 = \mathbb{E}\left\{\sigma (\bar{\tau} z)^2\right\}$ . This should be interpreted as follows: starting with a chosen  $\bar{\tau}$ , we normalize the input data  $\pmb{x}$  according to  $\bar{\tau}_0^2 = \mathbb{E}\left\{\sigma (\bar{\tau} z)^2\right\}$ ; then we choose  $\sigma_W^2\leq \sigma_{W,\max}^2$  and  $\sigma_b^2$  according to Eq. (1). Under this constraint, it is easy to see that  $\bar{\tau}_{\ell} = \bar{\tau}$  for all  $\ell \geq 1$ , and hence the norm of the input to each of the encoder's hidden layers is preserved by Claim (a) of Theorem 1. We then have that as  $L\to \infty$  at small  $\ell \geq 2$  (i.e., at the layers near the two ends of the autoencoder),  $\gamma_{\ell}\rightarrow \gamma$  and  $\rho_{\ell}\rightarrow \rho$ , where  $(\gamma ,\rho)$  is jointly a stable fixed point of  $\gamma = G(\gamma ,\rho)$  and  $\rho = R(\gamma ,\rho)$ . The autoencoder's output is then, in this limit,

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {x}} \cong S _ {\mathrm {s i g}} \boldsymbol {x} + S _ {\mathrm {v a r}} \boldsymbol {z}, \quad S _ {\mathrm {s i g}} = \beta \gamma , \quad S _ {\mathrm {v a r}} = \sqrt {\beta \rho},
$$

for  $\pmb{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_{n_0})$  independent of  $\pmb{x}$ .

In either cases, we see that  $\hat{x}_{\ell}$  or  $\hat{x}$  is a composition of a signal component and a Gaussian variation component. Their respective strengths  $S_{\mathrm{sig}}$  and  $S_{\mathrm{var}}$  admit simple expressions, thanks to the infinite- $L$  simplification<sup>6</sup>. We note that  $G$  and  $R$  do not take  $\sigma_b^2$  as a parameter. We refer to Appendix C.1 for the computation of  $\gamma$  and  $\rho$ . Fig. 1 shows that our asymptotic simplification is quite accurate already for  $L$  on the order of a few tens.

We also remark that the equation  $\bar{\tau}^2 = T\left(\bar{\tau}^2\right)$  is known in the signal propagation analysis of random feedforward networks (Poole et al. (2016)), but the equations  $\gamma = G(\gamma, \rho)$  and  $\rho = R(\gamma, \rho)$  are new. We also observe that in these equations, there is the presence of  $\alpha$  (through  $\beta$ ), which is typically missing from such analyses. Hence unlike untied structures, one may expect to see architectural constraints in analyses of weight-tied structures.

# 3.2 PHASE TRANSITION OF THE FIXED POINT

With the infinite depth simplification, one question is on the existence of the solutions to Eq. (2) and (3), and how these fixed points look like. (Eq. (1) is well-studied, cf. Poole et al. (2016); Hayou et al. (2018), and we will not analyze it here.) We note that  $\gamma = 0$  is always a solution to Eq. (2), in

Figure 1: The gaps  $|\gamma_2 - \gamma|$  and  $|\rho_2 - \rho|$  versus the depth  $L$ , where  $\gamma_2$  and  $\rho_2$  (which are dependent on  $L$ ) are as in Section 2.2, and  $\gamma$  and  $\rho$  (the infinite-  $L$  limits of  $\gamma_2$  and  $\rho_2$ ) are from Eq. (2) and (3). Here all activations are tanh,  $\bar{\tau}^2 = 1.2$ ,  $\sigma_b^2 = 0.211$ ,  $\sigma_W^2 = 2.312 < \sigma_{W,\max}^2 \approx 2.806$ , and  $\bar{\tau}_0^2 \approx 0.4276$ , which satisfies  $\bar{\tau}_0^2 = \mathbb{E}\left\{\sigma(\bar{\tau}z)^2\right\}$ . From left to right:  $\alpha = 0.9$ ,  $\alpha = 1.0$  and  $\alpha = 1.5$ . The gaps decrease exponentially with the depth  $L$ .

which case Eq. (3) also has a solution, for instance, when  $\varphi(0) = 0$  such as ReLU or tanh (which admits  $\rho = 0$ ). However  $\gamma = 0$  is trivial, since it implies  $S_{\mathrm{sig}}$  is zero. We will be interested in the existence of non-trivial and stable fixed points. To ease visualization, for the moment, let us consider Eq. (2) only. Fig. 2 shows  $\gamma \mapsto G(\gamma, \rho)$  for different  $\rho, \beta, \varphi$  and  $\sigma$  for  $\bar{\tau}^2 = 1$ . For a given  $\varphi$  and  $\sigma$ , depending on  $\beta$  and  $\rho$ , one may observe one or more fixed points, one of which is at  $\gamma = 0$  and can be stable or unstable. When  $\gamma = 0$  is the only fixed point but is unstable, we have  $\gamma = \infty$  as the "stable solution" to Eq. (2). The solution landscape changes drastically with  $\beta$ ; for instance, when  $\sigma = \varphi = \tanh$ ,  $\gamma = 0$  is the only and stable fixed point when  $\beta$  is small, but it becomes unstable and a new fixed point at  $\gamma > 0$  emerges when  $\beta$  is sufficiently large. This hints at certain phase transition behaviors as  $\beta$  varies.

In Appendix C.2, we perform a detailed analysis of Eq. (2) and (3), supported by several rigorously proven properties. In the following, by an initialization for  $\gamma$  and  $\rho$ , we mean  $\gamma_{L + 1}$  and  $\rho_{L + 1}$  as in Section 2.2, and by convergence to  $\gamma$  and  $\rho$ , we mean the convergences as in Section 3.1. We highlight some results from the analysis for specific pairs of  $\varphi$  and  $\sigma$ :

$\mathbf{ReLU}\varphi$  and  $\sigma$ . We have two phase transitions at  $\beta = 2$  and at  $\beta = 4$ . When  $\beta < 2$ , with any initialization, we have convergence to  $\gamma = 0$  and  $\rho = 0$ . When  $2 < \beta < 4$ , we have, with certain initializations, convergence to  $\gamma = 0$  and divergence to  $\rho = +\infty$ , and with certain other initializations, divergence to  $\gamma = +\infty$  and  $\rho = +\infty$ . These include almost all possible initializations. When  $\beta \geq 4$ , with any non-zero initialization, we have divergence to  $\gamma = +\infty$  and  $\rho = +\infty$ .

$\mathbf{ReLU}\varphi$  and  $\tanh \sigma$ . We have two phase transitions at  $\beta = 2$  and  $\beta = \beta_0(\bar{\tau}) \in (2,\infty)$ . When  $\beta < 2$ , with any initialization, we have convergence to  $\gamma = 0$  and  $\rho = 0$ . When  $2 < \beta < \beta_0$ , with any non-zero initialization, we have convergence to  $\gamma = 0$  and divergence to  $\rho = +\infty$ . When  $\beta > \beta_0$ , with any non-zero initialization, we have divergence to  $\gamma = +\infty$  and hence  $\rho = +\infty$ .

$\tanh \varphi$  and  $\sigma$ . We have two phase transitions at  $\beta = 1$  and  $\beta = \beta_0(\bar{\tau}) > 1$ . When  $\beta \leq 1$ , we have convergence to  $\gamma = \rho = 0$ . When  $1 < \beta < \beta_0$ , with any non-zero initialization, we have convergence to  $\gamma = 0$  and  $\rho \in (0,1)$ . When  $\beta > \beta_0$ , with any non-zero initialization, we have convergence to  $\gamma > 0$  and  $\rho \in (0,1)$ . For  $\bar{\tau} > 0$ ,  $\gamma$  cannot grow to  $+\infty$  as  $\beta$  varies. We note that  $\beta_0 \to 1$  if  $\bar{\tau}^2 \to 0$ , and in the case  $\alpha = 1$ , this implies  $\sigma_W^2 \to 1$ . With respect to Eq. (1), we then have  $\sigma_b^2 \to 0$ . An illustration is given in Fig. 3.

tanh  $\varphi$  and ReLU  $\sigma$ . We have a picture similar to the case  $\varphi = \sigma = \tanh$ , with a crucial difference that one cannot have  $\beta_0$  be close to 1. An illustration is given in Fig. 3.

$\gamma$  and  $\rho$  thus exhibit phase transitions, depend crucially on the choice of activations (especially the decoder activation  $\varphi$ ), and can be trivialized (i.e., being zero or infinity) as in the case of ReLU  $\varphi$  and  $\sigma$ . It is remarkable that the above pictures are general for many other activations, as suggested by our analysis. In the next sections, we explore the implications of these behaviors.

# 3.3 APPROXIMATE INFERENCE AT INFINITE DEPTH

Theorem 1 gives a quantitatively exact sense of how the random weight-tied autoencoder performs "approximate inference". Here we will be interested in stronger notions. A first question is: does it explain reversibility? Reversibility, as mathematically formalized in previous works Arora et al. (2015); Gilbert et al. (2017), quantitatively concerns with how small the quantity  $\mathcal{E} = \| \pmb{x} - \hat{\pmb{x}}\|^2 / n_0$  is. The smaller it is, the better the decoder "reverses" the encoder. This formalized notion is an attempt to give a theoretical understanding of empirical findings that the input could be reproduced from the values of hidden layers of a trained feedforward network. Let us now consider the infinite depth simplification under Interpretation 2 of Section 3.1. We have  $\mathcal{E} \simeq (S_{\mathrm{sig}} - 1)^2\bar{\tau}_0^2 + S_{\mathrm{var}}^2$ . As such, for  $\mathcal{E} \approx 0$  with high probability, one must have  $S_{\mathrm{sig}} \approx 1$  and  $S_{\mathrm{var}} \approx 0$ , hence  $\rho \approx 0$ . Consequently,  $\mathbb{E}\left\{\varphi (\sigma (\bar{\tau} z_1))^2\right\} \approx 0$ . For  $\bar{\tau} > 0$ ,  $\mathbb{E}\left\{\varphi (\sigma (\bar{\tau} z_1))^2\right\} = 0$  is impossible for any non-trivial activations (unless the activation outputs zero almost everywhere). Strikingly, in light of Section 3.2, when  $\varphi$  and  $\sigma$  are both ReLU, we have that  $S_{\mathrm{sig}}$  and  $S_{\mathrm{var}}$  are either 0 or  $+\infty$ , in which case  $\mathcal{E} \geq \bar{\tau}_0^2$  and can become unbounded. While this does not contradict the results in Arora et al. (2015) (which also concerns with ReLU activations, but with specific choices of the biases and limited depth, and hence is in a different setting), our discussion suggests that random weight-tied models may be insufficient to explain reversibility.

A second question is: does the model perform signal recovery? In this case, we are interested in whether  $\hat{x} \cong c\pmb{x}$  for some constant  $c$  not necessarily 1. Similar to the above, this requires  $S_{\mathrm{var}} = 0$ , hence  $\rho = 0$ , and  $\mathbb{E}\left\{\varphi (\beta \gamma \sigma (\bar{\tau} z_1))^2\right\} = 0$ . For non-trivial  $\varphi$  and  $\sigma$ , this requires  $\varphi (0) = 0$  and  $\gamma = 0$ . Many activations do not conform with the former, and the latter implies  $\hat{x} \cong 0$  undesirably. This provides a negative answer to the question.

A critic may argue that in expectation,  $\mathbb{E}\{\hat{x}\} \approx S_{\mathrm{sig}}x$ , and as per Section 3.2, there are cases where  $\gamma >0$  and hence  $S_{\mathrm{sig}} > 0$ . Yet in fact, this in-expectation property can already be observed in the simple setting of linear shallow autoencoders (Arora et al. (2015)). What is ignored in such argument is that in many cases,  $S_{\mathrm{var}} > 0$  whenever  $S_{\mathrm{sig}} > 0$ , in light Section 3.2. Our analysis hence mitigates

the shortcoming of the in-expectation approach, and gives a more precise understanding of what the random weight-tied autoencoder can and cannot achieve when the depth becomes large.

# 3.4 COMPARISON WITH THE SHALLOW CASE

Our result also allows for the case of  $L = 1$  a shallow autoencoder. In particular, taking a parallel setting with Section 3.1 (in particular, Interpretation 2), by Theorem 1,

$$
\hat {\boldsymbol {x}} \cong S _ {\mathrm {s i g}} \boldsymbol {x} + S _ {\mathrm {v a r}} \boldsymbol {z}, \quad S _ {\mathrm {s i g}} = \beta \gamma , \quad S _ {\mathrm {v a r}} = \sqrt {\beta \rho},
$$

in which, with  $\varphi_{\mathrm{hid}}$  being the activation in the hidden layer,

$$
\gamma = \frac {1}{\bar {\tau} ^ {2}} \mathbb {E} \left\{\bar {\tau} z \varphi_ {\mathrm {h i d}} (\bar {\tau} z) \right\}, \quad \rho = \mathbb {E} \left\{\varphi_ {\mathrm {h i d}} (\bar {\tau} z) ^ {2} \right\}.
$$

Some observations follow. In the shallow case,  $\gamma > 0$  and  $\rho > 0$  and both are bounded regardless of the parameters, except for trivial edge cases such as  $\bar{\tau}^2 = 0$  or  $\varphi_{\mathrm{hid}}(\cdot) = 0$ . Furthermore,  $\gamma$  and  $\rho$  are independent of  $\beta$ , for a fixed  $\bar{\tau}$ . As such, there is no phase transition in  $\gamma$  and  $\rho$  as  $\beta$  changes. We also have  $S_{\mathrm{sig}}(\beta) = \Theta(\beta)$  and  $S_{\mathrm{var}}(\beta) = \Theta(\sqrt{\beta})$ , and hence, the signal component dominates with  $S_{\mathrm{sig}} / S_{\mathrm{var}} = \Theta(\sqrt{\beta})$ . Again this happens regardless of parameter choices.

In comparison with the infinite depth case, for  $\varphi = \sigma = \tanh$  or  $\varphi = \tanh$  and  $\sigma$  being the ReLU, as observed from Fig. 3, in certain regimes,  $\gamma$ ,  $\rho$  and  $\gamma/\sqrt{\rho}$  can grow (sublinearly) with  $\beta$ , and hence  $S_{\mathrm{sig}}(\beta) = \Omega(\beta)$ ,  $S_{\mathrm{var}}(\beta) = \Omega(\sqrt{\beta})$ , and the signal component dominates with  $S_{\mathrm{sig}}/S_{\mathrm{var}} = \Omega(\sqrt{\beta})$ . In particular, near the phase transition of  $\gamma$ ,  $S_{\mathrm{sig}}/S_{\mathrm{var}} = \Omega(\beta^{1.5})$ . Recalling that  $\beta = \alpha \sigma_W^2$ , this implies for the infinite depth case, as compared to the shallow one, firstly a slight perturbation in  $\sigma_W^2$  may result in a larger perturbation in the signal's strength, and secondly an architecture using larger  $\alpha$  may gain more in terms of amplification of the signals. In short, the deep autoencoder is more sensitive to slight changes in the parameters. As evident in Section 3.2, the case  $\varphi$  being the ReLU also exhibits extreme sensitivity, in that it is possible for a slight perturbation in  $\beta$  to drastically change  $\gamma$  and  $\rho$ . As suggested by Fig. 1, it should be the case already for  $L$  about a few tens. It is, however, at the expense of much care in the selection of parameters, since there are continuous regimes in which the infinite depth diminishes  $S_{\mathrm{sig}}$  and  $S_{\mathrm{var}}$  to zero or boost them to infinity, a situation that never occurs in the shallow case.

Remark 4. Sensitivity to perturbations is implied by expressivity, a notion put forth in Poole et al. (2016) in the study of random feedforward networks. Hence we expect that sensitivity is a common feature of various types of deep neural networks.

# 3.5 IMPLICATIONS TO TRAINING INITIALIZATION

We examine the implications of Interpretation 1 in Section 3.1 to trainability of the weight-tied autoencoder. Since the majority of intermediate layers can be described approximately by  $\gamma$  and  $\rho$  (as well as  $\bar{\tau}$ ) and the random weight-tied autoencoder is in fact one at initialization, appropriate values of  $\gamma$ ,  $\rho$  and  $\bar{\tau}$  (by a suitable choice of  $\sigma_W^2$  and  $\sigma_b^2$ ) should lead to better trainability. In particular, if one of them is  $\infty$ , we expect numerical errors or too large values resulting in quick saturation, both of which render the autoencoder untrainable. If  $\gamma = \rho = 0$  in a neighborhood of the chosen  $\sigma_W^2$  and  $\sigma_b^2$ , we expect that the progress is slowed down in the beginning. If such situations are avoided, the autoencoder is expected to show a faster progress. As a special remark on the case  $\varphi$  is the ReLU, as per Section 3.2, when  $\alpha = 1$ , our hypothesis suggests taking  $\sigma_W^2 = 2$  and  $\sigma_b^2 = 0$ . This coincides with the celebrated He initialization (He et al. (2015)), which however considers feedforward networks only. Interestingly this does require  $\sigma$  to be the ReLU; for instance,  $\sigma$  can be tanh, in which case the argument in (He et al. (2015)) is not applicable.

Table 1 lists several initialization schemes, for  $\alpha = 1$ . We also mark the schemes that are edge of chaos (EOC) initializations (Schoenholz et al. (2016); Pennington et al. (2017)), which we review in Appendix E.1. The EOC initialization enables better signal propagation in deep feedforward networks, and in our context, is relevant to the encoder part with the activation  $\sigma$ . We perform simple experiments to verify our expectations on a weight-tied vanilla autoencoder as described in Section 3.1:  $L = 100$ , all hidden dimensions of 400, identity input activation  $\sigma_0$ , and decoder biases initialized to zero. This sets  $\alpha_{\ell} = \alpha = 1$  for  $\ell \geq 2$ ; here  $\alpha_{1} \neq 1$  is irrelevant in light of Interpretation 1. We train the autoencoder on the MNIST dataset with mini-batch gradient descent with a batch

Here “-” indicates a positive finite value that depends on the choice of  $\varphi_L$  (for which we choose the ReLU), but its exact value is irrelevant for our purpose. “EOC” indicates whether the scheme is an EOC initialization with respect to  $\sigma$ , and “xx” indicates an EOC scheme that is found to be the better one among all EOC initializations with Gaussian weights (Pennington et al. (2017)). “Trainable” indicates better trainability in the beginning as predicted by our theory. “Slowed” indicates  $\gamma = \rho = 0$  in a neighborhood. “Inf” indicates either  $\gamma \to \infty$  or  $\rho \to \infty$ . The schemes with  $\varphi = \tanh$  should be reflected against Fig. 3.

size of 250 and without regularizations, for  $5 \times 10^{5}$  iterations (equivalent to 2500 epochs). We perform the experiments in two settings:

- Setting 1: The output activation  $\varphi_0$  is tanh, MNIST images are normalized to  $[-1, +1]$ , and the learning rate is fixed at  $5 \times 10^{-3}$ . This is standard for MNIST.  
- Setting 2:  $\varphi_0$  is the identity, MNIST images are unnormalized (i.e., normalized to  $[0, +1]$ ), and the learning rate is fixed at  $3 \times 10^{-3}$ . This is common for regression.

These learning rates are chosen so that the learning dynamics is typically smooth, in light of recent works Mei et al. (2018); Smith & Le (2018). We use the normalized  $\ell_2^2$  loss  $\| \hat{\pmb{x}} -\pmb {x}\| ^2 /\| \pmb {x}\| ^2$ , and are primarily interested in this loss as a quality measure, since we only focus on trainability<sup>7</sup>. We also do not apply techniques such as greedy layer-wise pre-training, drop-out or batch normalization.

The results are plotted in Fig. 4. See also Appendix D.1 for visualization of the reconstructions, and Appendix D.2 for the evolution over a broader range of parameters. Note that we plot the evolution in the logarithmic scale of time, since it is typically smooth and revealing on this scale, as found in prior works Baity-Jesi et al. (2018); Mei et al. (2018) and also evident from the plots. The results are in good agreement with our prediction. Note that as predicted, in Setting 2, Scheme 3 and 6 are trapped with numerical errors, and in Setting 1, they saturate quickly at a high loss. As such, we do not include the results of Scheme 3 and 6 in Fig. 4.

We see from the figure that Scheme 2, 5, 8, 10 and 14 show much slower progresses, by a factor of 3 to 10 times in terms of training iterations to reach the same loss. Hence a good amount of training time can be saved by an appropriate initialization. Interestingly Scheme 5 is in fact a special EOC initialization that Pennington et al. (2017) found to be the better one among all EOC schemes with Gaussian weights for tanh activation. This last observation shows that having good signal propagation through the encoder is far from being a sufficient condition for trainability.

Among the schemes, only Scheme 1 and 4 in Setting 1 and only Scheme 1, 4 and 7 in Setting 2 have their eventual trained networks produce meaningful reconstructions, whereas the rest always output some "average" of the training set regardless of the input, at the end of  $5 \times 10^{5}$  iterations (see Appendix D.1). It is unclear whether this is a bad local minimum, or whether these schemes take much longer to show further progresses. An explanation is beyond our current theory, and it is an open question how to create a scheme with meaningful trainability. Remarkably all the schemes that show slower initial progresses (Scheme 2, 5, 8, 10 and 14) are among those that could not yield meaningful reconstructions.

We observe that in Setting 2, the tanh network under Scheme 7 is best performing in terms of the reconstruction loss, and its progress does not seem to reach a plateau after  $5 \times 10^{5}$  iterations. In both settings, Scheme 4, which is a hybrid of ReLU and tanh activations, shows slight improvements over Scheme 1, which is a purely ReLU network. This extends the conclusion in Pennington et al. (2017) to the context of weight-tied autoencoders: reasonable training at a large depth is possible even for the notoriously difficult tanh activation, and this necessarily requires careful initializations.

# 4 DISCUSSION

This paper has shown quantitative answers to the three questions posed in Section 1. This feat is enabled by an exact analysis via Theorem 1. The theorem is stated in a general setting, allowing varying activations, weight variances, etc, but our analyses in Section 3 have made several simplifications. This leaves a question of whether these simplifications can be relaxed, and how the picture changes accordingly, for instance, when the parameters vary across layers, similar to Yang & Schoenholz (2018). Many other questions also remain. For example, what would be the covariance structure between the outputs of two distinct inputs? How does the network's Jacobian matrix look like? These questions have been answered in the feedforward case (Poole et al. (2016); Pennington et al. (2017)), but we believe answering them is more technically involved in our case. We have also seen that an autoencoder that shows initial progress may not necessarily produce meaningful reconstruction eventually after training, and hence much more work is needed to understand the training dynamics far beyond initialization. Recent works Mei et al. (2018); Rotskoff & Vanden-Eijnden (2018); Sirignano & Spiliopoulos (2018); Chizat & Bach (2018) have made progresses in this direction for shallow networks.
