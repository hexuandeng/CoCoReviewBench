# ABSTRACT

This paper establishes risk convergence and asymptotic weight matrix alignment — a form of implicit regularization — of gradient flow and gradient descent when applied to deep linear networks on linearly separable data. In more detail, for gradient flow applied to strictly decreasing loss functions (with similar results for gradient descent with particular decreasing step sizes): (1) the risk converges to 0; (ii) the normalized  $i^{\mathrm{th}}$  weight matrix asymptotically equals its rank-1 approximation  $u_{i}v_{i}^{\top}$ ; (iii) these rank-1 matrices are aligned across layers, meaning  $|v_{i + 1}^{\top}u_{i}| \to 1$ . In the case of the logistic loss (binary cross entropy), more can be said: the linear function induced by the network — the product of its weight matrices — converges to the same direction as the maximum margin solution. This last property was identified in prior work, but only under assumptions on gradient descent which here are implied by the alignment phenomenon.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Efforts to explain the effectiveness of gradient descent in deep learning have uncovered an exciting possibility: it not only finds solutions with low error, but also biases the search for low complexity solutions which generalize well (Zhang et al., 2017; Bartlett et al., 2017; Soudry et al., 2017; Gunasekar et al., 2018).

This paper analyzes the implicit regularization of gradient descent and gradient flow on deep linear networks and linearly separable data. For strictly decreasing losses, the optimum is off at infinity, and we establish various alignment phenomena:

- For each weight matrix  $W_{i}$ , the corresponding normalized weight matrix  $W_{i} / \| W_{i}\|_{F}$  asymptotically equals its rank-1 approximation  $u_{i}v_{i}^{\top}$ , where the Frobenius norm  $\| W_{i}\|_{F}$  satisfies  $\| W_{i}\|_{F}\to \infty$ . In other words,  $\| W_i\|_2 / \| W_i\|_F\to 1$ , and asymptotically only the rank-1 approximation of each weight matrix contributes to the final predictor, a form of implicit regularization.  
- Adjacent rank-1 weight matrix approximations are aligned:  $|v_{i+1}^{\top} u_i| \to 1$ .  
- For the logistic loss, the first right singular vector  $v_{1}$  of  $W_{1}$  is aligned with the data, meaning  $v_{1}$  converges to the unique maximum margin predictor  $\bar{u}$  defined by the data. Moreover, the linear predictor induced by the network,  $w_{\mathrm{prod}} := W_L \cdots W_1$ , is also aligned with the data, meaning  $w_{\mathrm{prod}} / \| w_{\mathrm{prod}} \| \to \bar{u}$ .

Simultaneously, this work proves that the risk is globally optimized: it asymptotes to 0. Alignment and risk convergence are proved simultaneously; the phenomena are coupled within the proofs.

The paper is organized as follows. This introduction continues with related work, notation, and assumptions in Sections 1.1 and 1.2. The analysis of gradient flow is in Section 2, and gradient descent is analyzed in Section 3. The paper closes with future directions in Section 4; a particular highlight is a preliminary experiment on CIFAR-10 which establishes empirically that a form of the alignment phenomenon occurs on the standard nonlinear network AlexNet.

Figure 1b shows the alignment phenomenon in the 4-layer network, plotted against the risk. Specifically, for each layer, the ratio of spectral to Frobenius norms is plotted, and converges to 1. As in the theoretical analysis, the convergence in alignment and risk occur simultaneously.

# 1.1 RELATED WORK

On the implicit regularization of gradient descent, Soudry et al. (2017) show that for linear predictors and linearly separable data, the gradient descent iterates converge to the same direction as the maximum margin solution. Ji & Telgarsky (2018) further characterize such an implicit bias for general nonseparable data. Gunasekar et al. (2018) consider gradient descent on fully connected linear networks and linear convolutional networks. In particular, for the exponential loss, assuming the risk is minimized to 0 and the gradients converge in direction, they show that the whole network converges in direction to the maximum margin solution. These two assumptions are on the gradient descent process itself, and specifically the second one might be hard to interpret and justify. Compared with Gunasekar et al. (2018), this paper proves that the risk converges to 0 and the weight matrices align; moreover the proof here proves the properties simultaneously, rather than assuming one and deriving the other. Lastly, for ReLU networks, Du et al. (2018) show that gradient flow does not change the difference between squared Frobenius norms of any two layers.

For a smooth (nonconvex) function, Lee et al. (2016) show that any strict saddle can be avoided almost surely with small step sizes. If there are only countably many saddle points and they are all strict, and if gradient descent iterates converge, then this implies (almost surely) they converge to a local minimum. In the present work, since there is no finite local minimum, gradient descent will go to infinity and never converge, and thus these results of Lee et al. (2016) do not show that the risk converges to 0.

There has been a rich literature on linear networks. Saxe et al. (2013) analyze the learning dynamics of deep linear networks, showing that they exhibit some learning patterns similar to nonlinear networks, such as a long plateau followed by a rapid risk drop. Arora et al. (2018) show that depth can help accelerate optimization. On the landscape properties of deep linear networks, Lu & Kawaguchi (2017); Laurent & von Brecht (2017) show that under various structural assumptions, all local optima are global. Zhou & Liang (2018) give a necessary and sufficient characterization of critical points for deep linear networks.

# 1.2 NOTATION, SETTING, AND ASSUMPTIONS

Consider a data set  $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ , where  $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ ,  $\|x_i\| \leq 1$ , and  $y_i \in \{-1, +1\}$ . The data set is assumed to be linearly separable, i.e., there exists a unit vector  $u$  which correctly classifies every data point: for any  $1 \leq i \leq n$ ,  $y_i\langle u, x_i\rangle > 0$ . Furthermore, let  $\gamma := \max_{\|u\|=1} \min_{1 \leq i \leq n} y_i\langle u, x_i\rangle > 0$  denote the maximum margin, and  $\bar{u} := \arg \max_{\|u\|=1} \min_{1 \leq i \leq n} y_i\langle u, x_i\rangle$  denote the maximum margin solution (the solution to the hard-margin SVM).

A linear network of depth  $L$  is parameterized by weight matrices  $W_{L},\ldots ,W_{1}$ , where  $W_{k}\in \mathbb{R}^{d_{k}\times d_{k - 1}}$ ,  $d_0 = d$ , and  $d_{L} = 1$ . Let  $W = (W_{L},\dots ,W_{1})$  denote all parameters of the network. The (empirical) risk induced by the network is given by

$$
\mathcal {R} (W) = \mathcal {R} \left(W _ {L}, \dots , W _ {1}\right) = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \ell \left(y _ {i} W _ {L} \dots W _ {1} x _ {i}\right) = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \ell \left(\langle w _ {\mathrm {p r o d}}, z _ {i} \rangle\right),
$$

where  $w_{\mathrm{prod}} \coloneqq (W_L \cdots W_1)^\top$ , and  $z_i \coloneqq y_i x_i$ .

The loss  $\ell$  is assumed to be continuously differentiable, unbounded, and strictly decreasing to 0. Examples include the exponential loss  $\ell_{\exp}(x) = e^{-x}$  and the logistic loss  $\ell_{\log}(x) = \ln \left(1 + e^{-x}\right)$ .

Assumption 1.  $\ell' < 0$  is continuous,  $\lim_{x \to -\infty} \ell(x) = \infty$  and  $\lim_{x \to \infty} \ell(x) = 0$ .

This paper considers gradient flow and gradient descent, where gradient flow  $\{W(t)|t\geq 0,t\in \mathbb{R}\}$  can be interpreted as gradient descent with infinitesimal step sizes. It starts from some  $W(0)$  at  $t = 0$  , and proceeds as

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d} W (t)}{\mathrm {d} t} = - \nabla \mathcal {R} (W (t)).
$$

By contrast, gradient descent  $\{W(t)|t\geq 0,t\in \mathbb{Z}\}$  is a discrete-time process given by

$$
W (t + 1) = W (t) - \eta_ {t} \nabla \mathcal {R} \left(W (t)\right),
$$

where  $\eta_t$  is the step size at time  $t$ .

We assume that the initialization of the network is not a critical point and induces a risk no larger than the risk of the trivial linear predictor 0.

Assumption 2. The initialization  $W(0)$  satisfies  $\nabla \mathcal{R}\left(W(0)\right) \neq 0$  and  $\mathcal{R}\left(W(0)\right) \leq \mathcal{R}(0) = \ell (0)$ .

It is natural to require that the initialization is not a critical point, since otherwise gradient flow/descent will never make a progress. The requirement  $\mathcal{R}\left(W(0)\right) \leq \mathcal{R}(0)$  can be easily satisfied, for example, by making  $W_{1}(0) = 0$  and  $W_{L}(0) \cdots W_{2}(0) \neq 0$ . On the other hand, if  $\mathcal{R}\left(W(0)\right) > \mathcal{R}(0)$ , gradient flow/descent may never minimize the risk to 0. Proofs of those claims are given in Appendix A.

# 2 RESULTS FOR GRADIENT FLOW

In this section, we consider gradient flow. Although impractical when compared with gradient descent, gradient flow can simplify the analysis and highlight proof ideas. For convenience, we usually use  $W$ ,  $W_{k}$ , and  $w_{\mathrm{prod}}$ , but they all change with (the continuous time)  $t$ . Only proof sketches are given here; detailed proofs are deferred to Appendix B.

# 2.1 RISK CONVERGENCE

One key property of gradient flow is that it never increases the risk:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathcal {R} (W)}{\mathrm {d} t} = \left\langle \nabla \mathcal {R} (W), \frac {\mathrm {d} W}{\mathrm {d} t} \right\rangle = - \| \nabla \mathcal {R} (W) \| ^ {2} = - \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {L} \left\| \frac {\partial \mathcal {R}}{\partial W _ {k}} \right\| _ {F} ^ {2} \leq 0. \tag {1}
$$

We now state the main result: under Assumptions 1 and 2, gradient flow minimizes the risk,  $W_{k}$  and  $w_{\mathrm{prod}}$  all go to infinity, and the alignment phenomenon occurs.

Theorem 1. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, gradient flow iterates satisfy the following properties:

-  $\lim_{t\to \infty}\mathcal{R}(W) = 0$  
- For any  $1 \leq k \leq L$ ,  $\lim_{t \to \infty} \| W_k \|_F = \infty$ .  
- For any  $1 \leq k \leq L$ , letting  $(u_k, v_k)$  denote the first left and right singular vectors of  $W_k$ ,

$$
\lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \left\| \frac {W _ {k}}{\| W _ {k} \| _ {F}} - u _ {k} v _ {k} ^ {\top} \right\| _ {F} = 0.
$$

Moreover, for any  $1 \leq k < L$ ,  $\lim_{t \to \infty} \left| \langle v_{k+1}, u_k \rangle \right| = 1$ . As a result,

$$
\lim  _ {t \rightarrow \infty} \left|\left\langle \frac {w _ {\operatorname* {p r o d}}}{\prod_ {k = 1} ^ {L} \| W _ {k} \| _ {F}}, v _ {1} \right\rangle\right| = 1,
$$

and thus  $\lim_{t\to \infty}\| w_{\mathrm{prod}}\| = \infty$

Theorem 1 is proved using two lemmas, which may be of independent interest. To show the ideas, let us first introduce a little more notation. Recall that  $\mathcal{R}(W)$  denotes the empirical risk induced by the deep linear network  $W$ . Abusing the notation a little, for any linear predictor  $w \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , we also use  $\mathcal{R}(w)$  to denote the risk induced by  $w$ . With this notation,  $\mathcal{R}(W) = \mathcal{R}(w_{\mathrm{prod}})$ , while

$$
\nabla \mathcal {R} (w _ {\mathrm {p r o d}}) = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \ell^ {\prime} (\langle w _ {\mathrm {p r o d}}, z _ {i} \rangle) z _ {i} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \ell^ {\prime} (W _ {L} \dots W _ {1} z _ {i}) z _ {i}
$$

is in  $\mathbb{R}^d$  and different from  $\nabla \mathcal{R}(W)$ , which has  $\sum_{k=1}^{L} d_k d_{k-1}$  entries, as given below:

$$
\frac {\partial \mathcal {R}}{\partial W _ {k}} = W _ {k + 1} ^ {\top} \dots W _ {L} ^ {\top} \nabla \mathcal {R} (w _ {\mathrm {p r o d}}) ^ {\top} W _ {1} ^ {\top} \dots W _ {k - 1} ^ {\top}.
$$

Furthermore, for any  $R > 0$ , let

$$
B(R) = \left\{W\bigg|\max_{1\leq k\leq L}\| W_{k}\|_{F}\leq R\right\} .
$$

The first lemma shows that for any  $R > 0$ , the time spent by gradient flow in  $B(R)$  is finite.

Lemma 1. Under Assumption 1 and 2, for any  $R > 0$ , there exists a constant  $\epsilon(R) > 0$ , such that for any  $t \geq 1$  and any  $W \in B(R)$ ,  $\|\partial \mathcal{R} / \partial W_1\|_F \geq \epsilon(R)$ . As a result, gradient flow spends a finite amount of time in  $B(R)$  for any  $R > 0$ , and  $\max_{1 \leq k \leq L} \|W_k\|_F$  is unbounded.

Here is the proof sketch. If  $\| W_k\| _F$  are bounded, then  $\| \nabla \mathcal{R}(w_{\mathrm{prod}})\|$  will be lower bounded by a positive constant, therefore if  $\| \partial \mathcal{R} / \partial W_1\| _F = \| W_L\dots W_2\| \| \nabla \mathcal{R}(w_{\mathrm{prod}})\|$  can be arbitrarily small, then  $\| W_L\dots W_2\|$  and  $\| w_{\mathrm{prod}}\|$  can also be arbitrarily small, and thus  $\mathcal{R}(W)$  can be arbitrarily close to  $\mathcal{R}(0)$ . This cannot happen after  $t = 1$ , otherwise it will contradict Assumption 2 and eq. (1).

To proceed, we need the following properties of linear networks from prior work (Arora et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018). For any time  $t \geq 0$  and any  $1 \leq k < L$ ,

$$
W _ {k + 1} ^ {\top} (t) W _ {k + 1} (t) - W _ {k + 1} ^ {\top} (0) W _ {k + 1} (0) = W _ {k} (t) W _ {k} ^ {\top} (t) - W _ {k} (0) W _ {k} ^ {\top} (0). \tag {2}
$$

To see this, just notice that

$$
W _ {k + 1} ^ {\top} \frac {\partial \mathcal {R}}{\partial W _ {k + 1}} = W _ {k + 1} ^ {\top} \dots W _ {L} ^ {\top} \nabla \mathcal {R} (w _ {\mathrm {p r o d}}) ^ {\top} W _ {1} ^ {\top} \dots W _ {k} ^ {\top} = \frac {\partial \mathcal {R}}{\partial W _ {k}} W _ {k} ^ {\top}.
$$

Taking the trace on both sides of eq. (2), we have

$$
\left\| W _ {k + 1} (t) \right\| _ {F} ^ {2} - \left\| W _ {k + 1} (0) \right\| _ {F} ^ {2} = \left\| W _ {k} (t) \right\| _ {F} ^ {2} - \left\| W _ {k} (0) \right\| _ {F} ^ {2}. \tag {3}
$$

In other words, the difference between the squares of Frobenius norms of any two layers remains a constant. Together with Lemma 1, it implies that all  $\| W_k\| _F$  are unbounded.

However, even if  $\| W_k\| _F$  are large, it does not follow necessarily that  $\| w_{\mathrm{prod}}\|$  is also large. Lemma 2 shows that this is indeed true: for gradient flow, as  $\| W_k\| _F$  get larger, adjacent layers also get more aligned to each other, which ensures that their product also has a large norm.

For  $1 \leq k \leq L$ , let  $\sigma_k, u_k$ , and  $v_k$  denote the first singular value (the 2-norm), the first left singular vector, and the first right singular vector of  $W_k$ , respectively. Furthermore, define

$$
D := \left(\max  _ {1 \leq k \leq L} \| W _ {k} (0) \| _ {F} ^ {2}\right) - \| W _ {L} (0) \| _ {F} ^ {2} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {L - 1} \left\| W _ {k} (0) W _ {k} ^ {\top} (0) - W _ {k + 1} ^ {\top} (0) W _ {k + 1} (0) \right\| _ {2},
$$

which depends only on the initialization. If for any  $1 \leq k < L$ ,  $W_{k}(0)W_{k}^{\top}(0) = W_{k + 1}^{\top}(0)W_{k + 1}(0)$ , then  $D = 0$ .

Lemma 2. The gradient flow iterates satisfy the following properties:

- For any  $1 \leq k \leq L$ ,  $\|W_k\|_F^2 - \|W_k\|_2^2 \leq D$ .  
- For any  $1 \leq k < L$ ,  $\langle v_{k+1}, u_k \rangle^2 \geq 1 - \left( D + \| W_{k+1}(0) \|_2^2 + \| W_k(0) \|_2^2 \right) / \| W_{k+1} \|_2^2$ .  
Suppose  $\max_{1\leq k\leq L}\| W_k\| _F\to \infty$  , then  $\left|\left\langle w_{\mathrm{prod}} / \Pi_{k = 1}^{L}\| W_{k}\|_{F},v_{1}\right\rangle \right|\rightarrow 1.$

The proof is based on eq. (2) and eq. (3). If  $W_{k}(0)W_{k}^{\top}(0) = W_{k + 1}^{\top}(0)W_{k + 1}(0)$ , then eq. (2) gives that  $W_{k + 1}$  and  $W_{k}$  have the same singular values, and  $W_{k + 1}$ 's right singular vectors and  $W_{k}$ 's left singular vectors are the same. If it is true for any two adjacent layers, since  $W_{L}$  is a row vector, all layers have rank 1. With general initialization, we have similar results when  $\| W_{k}\|_{F}$  is large enough so that the initialization is negligible. Careful calculations give the exact results in Lemma 2.

An interesting point is that the implicit regularization result in Lemma 2 helps establish risk convergence in Theorem 1. Specifically, by Lemma 2, if all layers have large norms,  $\| W_{L} \cdots W_{2} \|$  will be large. If the risk is not minimized to 0,  $\| \nabla \mathcal{R}(w_{\mathrm{prod}}) \|$  will be lower bounded by a positive constant, and thus  $\| \partial \mathcal{R} / \partial W_{1} \|_{F} = \| W_{L} \cdots W_{2} \| \| \nabla \mathcal{R}(w_{\mathrm{prod}}) \|$  will be large. Invoking eq. (1), Lemma 1 and eq. (3) gives a contradiction. Since the risk has no finite optimum,  $\| W_{k} \|_{F} \to \infty$ .

# 2.2 CONVERGENCE TO THE MAXIMUM MARGIN SOLUTION

Here we focus on the exponential loss  $\ell_{\mathrm{exp}}(x) = e^{-x}$  and the logistic loss  $\ell_{\log}(x) = \ln (1 + e^{-x})$ . In addition to risk convergence, these two losses also enable gradient descent to find the maximum margin solution.

To get such a strong convergence, we need one more assumption on the data set. Recall that  $\gamma = \max_{\| u \| = 1} \min_{1 \leq i \leq n} \langle u, z_i \rangle > 0$  denotes the maximum margin, and  $\bar{u}$  denotes the unique maximum margin predictor which attains this margin  $\gamma$ . Those data points  $z_i$  for which  $\langle \bar{u}, z_i \rangle = \gamma$  are called support vectors.

Assumption 3. The support vectors span the whole space  $\mathbb{R}^d$ .

Assumption 3 appears in prior work Soudry et al. (2017), and can be satisfied in many cases: for example, it is almost surely true if the number of support vectors is larger than or equal to  $d$  and the data set is sampled from some density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. It can also be relaxed to the situation that the support vectors and the whole data set span the same space; in this case  $\nabla \mathcal{R}(w_{\mathrm{prod}})$  will never leave this space, and we can always restrict our attention to this space.

With Assumption 3, we can state the main theorem.

Theorem 2. Under Assumptions 2 and 3, for almost all data and for losses  $\ell_{\mathrm{exp}}$  and  $\ell_{\mathrm{log}}$ , then  $\lim_{t\to \infty}\big|\langle v_1,\bar{u}\rangle \big| = 1$ , where  $v_{1}$  is the first right singular vector of  $W_{1}$ . As a result,  $\lim_{t\to \infty}w_{\mathrm{prod}} / \Pi_{k = 1}^{L}\| W_{k}\|_{F} = \bar{u}$ .

Theorem 2 relies on two structural lemmas. The first one is based on a similar almost-all argument due to Soudry et al. (2017, Lemma 8). Let  $S \subset \{1, \ldots, n\}$  denote the set of indices of support vectors.

Lemma 3. Under Assumption 3, if the data set is sampled from some density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure, then with probability 1,

$$
\alpha := \min  _ {| \xi | = 1, \xi \perp \bar {u}} \max  _ {i \in S} \langle \xi , z _ {i} \rangle > 0.
$$

Let  $\bar{u}^{\perp}$  denote the orthogonal complement of  $\operatorname{span}(\bar{u})$ , and let  $\Pi_{\perp}$  denote the projection onto  $\bar{u}^{\perp}$ .

Lemma 4. Under Assumption 3, for almost all data,  $\ell_{\mathrm{exp}}$  and  $\ell_{\log}$ , and any  $w \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , if  $\langle w, \bar{u} \rangle \geq 0$  and  $\| \Pi_{\perp} w \|$  is larger than  $1 + \ln(n) / \alpha$  for  $\ell_{\mathrm{exp}}$  or  $2n / e\alpha$  for  $\ell_{\log}$ , then  $\langle \Pi_{\perp} w, \nabla \mathcal{R}(w) \rangle \geq 0$ .

With Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 in hand, we can prove Theorem 2. Let  $\Pi_{\perp}W_{1}$  denote the projection of rows of  $W_{1}$  onto  $\bar{u}^{\perp}$ . Notice that

$$
\Pi_ {\perp} w _ {\mathrm {p r o d}} = \left(W _ {L} \dots W _ {2} (\Pi_ {\perp} W _ {1})\right) ^ {\top} \quad \mathrm {a n d} \quad \frac {\mathrm {d} \| \Pi_ {\perp} W _ {1} \| _ {F} ^ {2}}{\mathrm {d} t} = - \langle \Pi_ {\perp} w _ {\mathrm {p r o d}}, \nabla \mathcal {R} (w _ {\mathrm {p r o d}}) \rangle .
$$

If  $\| \Pi_{\perp}W_1\| _F$  is large compared with  $\| W_1\| _F$ , since layers become aligned,  $\| \Pi_{\perp}w_{\mathrm{prod}}\|$  will also be large, and then Lemma 4 implies that  $\| \Pi_{\perp}W_1\| _F$  will not increase. At the same time,  $\| W_1\| _F\to \infty$  and thus for large enough  $t$ ,  $\| \Pi_{\perp}W_1\| _F$  must be very small compared with  $\| W_1\| _F$ . Many details need to be handled to make this intuition exact; the proof is given in Appendix B.

# 3 RESULTS FOR GRADIENT DESCENT

One key property of gradient flow which is used in the previous proofs is that it never increases the risk, which is not necessarily true for gradient descent. However, for smooth losses (i.e., with Lipschitz continuous derivatives), we can design some decaying step sizes, with which gradient descent never increases the risk, and basically the same results hold as in the gradient flow case. Deferred proofs are given in Appendix C.

We make the following additional assumption on the loss, which is satisfied by the logistic loss  $\ell_{\log}$ .

Assumption 4.  $\ell^{\prime}$  is  $\beta$ -Lipschitz (i.e.,  $\ell$  is  $\beta$ -smooth), and  $|\ell^{\prime}| \leq G$  (i.e.,  $\ell$  is  $G$ -Lipschitz).

Under Assumption 4, the risk is also a smooth function of  $W$ , if all layers are bounded.

Lemma 5. Suppose  $\ell$  is  $\beta$ -smooth. If  $R \geq 1$ , then  $\beta(R) = 2L^2 R^{2L-2} (\beta + G)$ , and  $\mathcal{R}(W)$  is a  $\beta(R)$ -smooth function on the set  $B(R) = \{W \mid \|W_k\|_F \leq R, 1 \leq k \leq L\}$ .

Smoothness ensures that for any  $W, V \in B(R)$ ,  $\mathcal{R}(W) - \mathcal{R}(V) \leq \langle \nabla \mathcal{R}(V), W - V \rangle + \beta(R) \| W - V \|^2 / 2$  (see Bubeck et al. (2015) Lemma 3.4). In particular, if we choose some  $R$  and set a constant step size  $\eta_t = 1 / \beta(R)$ , then as long as  $W(t + 1)$  and  $W(t)$  are both in  $B(R)$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {R} (W (t + 1)) - \mathcal {R} (W (t)) \leq \left\langle \nabla \mathcal {R} (W (t)), - \eta_ {t} \nabla \mathcal {R} (W (t)) \right\rangle + \frac {\beta (R) \eta_ {t} ^ {2}}{2} \| \nabla \mathcal {R} (W (t)) \| ^ {2} \\ = - \frac {1}{2 \beta (R)} \left\| \nabla \mathcal {R} (W (t)) \right\| ^ {2} = - \frac {\eta_ {t}}{2} \left\| \nabla \mathcal {R} (W (t)) \right\| ^ {2}. \tag {4} \\ \end{array}
$$

In other words, the risk does not increase at this step. However, similar to gradient flow, the gradient descent iterate will eventually escape  $B(R)$ , which may increase the risk.

Lemma 6. Under Assumption 1, 2 and 4, suppose gradient descent is run with a constant step size  $1 / \beta (R)$ . Then there exists a time  $t$  when  $W(t) \notin B(R)$ , in other words,  $\max_{1 \leq k \leq L} \| W_k(t) \|_F > R$ .

Fortunately, this issue can be handled by adaptively increasing  $R$  and correspondingly decreasing the step sizes, formalized in the following assumption.

Assumption 5. The step size  $\eta_t = \min \{1 / \beta(R_t), 1\}$ , where  $R_t$  satisfies  $W(t) \in B(R_t)$ , and if  $W(t + 1) \in B(R_t)$ ,  $R_{t + 1} = R_t$ .

Assumption 5 can be satisfied by a line search, which ensures that the gradient descent update is not too aggressive and the boundary  $R$  is increased properly.

With the additional Assumptions 4 and 5, exactly the same theorems can be proved for gradient descent. We restate them briefly here.

Theorem 3. Under Assumption 1, 2, 4, and 5, gradient descent satisfies

Theorem 4. Under Assumption 2, 3, and Assumption 5, for the logistic loss  $\ell_{\log}$  and almost all data,  $\lim_{t\to \infty}\big|\langle v_1(t),\bar{u}\rangle \big| = 1$  , and  $\lim_{t\to \infty}w_{\mathrm{prod}}(t)\big{/}\prod_{k = 1}^{L}\| W_k(t)\| _F = \bar{u}$

Proofs of Theorem 3 and 4 are given in Appendix C, and are basically the same as the gradient flow proofs. The key difference is that an error of  $\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \eta_t^2 \|\nabla \mathcal{R}(W(t))\|^2$  will be introduced in many

parts of the proof. However, it is bounded in light of eq. (4):

$$
\sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \eta_ {t} ^ {2} \left\| \nabla \mathcal {R} (W (t)) \right\| ^ {2} \leq \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \eta_ {t} \left\| \nabla \mathcal {R} (W (t)) \right\| ^ {2} \leq 2 \mathcal {R} (W (0)).

Since all weight matrices go to infinity, such a bounded error does not matter asymptotically, and thus proofs still go through.

# 4 SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

This paper rigorously proves that, for deep linear networks on linearly separable data, gradient flow and gradient descent minimize the risk to 0, align adjacent weight matrices, and align the first right singular vector of the first layer to the maximum margin solution determined by the data. There are many potential future directions; a few are as follows.

Convergence rate. This paper only proves asymptotic convergence with no convergence rate. A convergence rate would allow the algorithm to be compared to other methods which also globally optimize this objective, would also suggest ways to improve step sizes and initialization, and ideally even exhibit a sensitivity to the network architecture and suggest how it could be improved.

Nonseparable data and nonlinear networks. Real-world data is generally not linearly separable, but nonlinear deep networks can reliably decrease the risk to 0, even with random labels (Zhang et al., 2017). This seems to suggest that a nonlinear notion of separability is at play; is there some way to adapt the present analysis?

The present analysis is crucially tied to the alignment of weight matrices: alignment and risk are analyzed simultaneously. Motivated by this, consider a preliminary experiment, presented in Figure 2, where stochastic gradient descent was used to minimize the risk of a standard AlexNet on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009).

Even though there are ReLUs, max-pooling layers, and convolutional layers, the alignment phenomenon is occurring in a reduced form on the dense layers (the last three layers of the network). Specifically, despite these weight matrices having shape (1024, 4096), (4096, 4096), and (4096, 10) the key alignment ratios  $\| W_i\|_2 / \| W_i\|_F$  are much larger than their respective lower bounds  $(1024^{-1/2}, 4096^{-1/2}, 10^{-1/2})$ . Two initializations were tried: default PyTorch initialization, and a Gaussian initialization forcing all initial Frobenius norms to be just 4, which is suggested by the norm preservation property in the analysis and removes noise in the weights.
