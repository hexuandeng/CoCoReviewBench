# ABSTRACT

Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms designed for handling complex visual observations typically learn some sort of latent state representation, either explicitly or implicitly. Standard methods of this sort do not distinguish between functionally relevant aspects of the state and irrelevant distractors, instead aiming to represent all available information equally. We propose a modified objective for model-based RL that, in combination with mutual information maximization, allows us to learn representations and dynamics for visual model-based RL without reconstruction in a way that explicitly prioritizes functionally relevant factors. The key principle behind our design is to integrate a term inspired by variational empowerment into a state-space learning model based on mutual information. This term prioritizes information that is correlated with action, thus ensuring that functionally relevant factors are captured first. Furthermore, the same empowerment term also promotes faster exploration during the RL process, especially for sparse-reward tasks where the reward signal is insufficient to drive exploration in the early stages of learning. We evaluate the approach on a suite of vision-based robot control tasks with natural video backgrounds, and show that the proposed prioritized information objective outperforms state-of-the-art model based RL approaches by an average of  $20\%$  in terms of episodic returns at 1M environment interactions with  $30\%$  higher sample efficiency at 100k interactions.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising approach to accelerating skill learning: by acquiring a predictive model that represents how the world works, an agent can quickly derive effective strategies, either by planning or by simulating synthetic experience under the model. However, in complex environments with high-dimensional observations (e.g., images), modeling the full observation space can present major challenges. While large neural network models have made progress on this problem (Finn & Levine, 2017; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Hafner et al., 2019a; Watter et al., 2015; Babaeizadeh et al., 2017), sample-efficient learning necessitates some mechanism to prioritize modeling the observation space so as to most quickly capture the functionality relevant factors. This needs to be done without wasting effort and capacity on irrelevant distractors, and without detailed reconstruction. Several recent works have proposed contrastive objectives that maximize mutual information between observations and latent states (Hjelm et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2020; Oord et al., 2018; Srinivas et al., 2020). While such objectives avoid reconstruction, they still do not distinguish between relevant irrelevant factors of variation. We thus pose the question: can we devise non-reconstructive representation learning methods that explicitly prioritize information that is most likely to be functionally relevant to the agent?

In this work, we derive a model-based RL algorithm from a combination of representation learning via mutual information maximization (Poole et al., 2019) and empowerment (Mohamed & Rezende, 2015). The latter serves to drive both the representation and the policy toward exploring and representing functionally relevant factors of variation. By integrating an empowerment-based term into a mutual information framework for learning state representations, we effectively prioritize information that is most likely to have functional relevance, which mitigates distractions due to irrelevant factors of variation in the observations. By integrating this same term into policy learning, we further improve exploration, particularly in the early stages of learning in sparse-reward environments, where the reward signal provides comparatively little guidance.

Figure 1: Overview of InfoPower.  $I(\mathcal{O}_t;Z_t)$  is the contrastive learning objective for learning an encoder to map from image  $\mathcal{O}$  to latent  $Z$ .  $I(A_{t - 1};Z_t|Z_{t - 1})$  is the empowerment objective that prioritizes encoding controllable representations in  $Z$ .  $-I(i_{t + 1};Z_{t + 1}|Z_t,A_t)$  helps learn a latent forward dynamics model so that future  $Z_{t + k}$  can be predicted from current  $Z_{t}$ .  $I(R_{t};Z_{t})$  helps learn a reward prediction model, such that the agent can learn a plan  $A_{t},..A_{t + k},..$  through latent rollouts. Together, this combination of terms produces a latent state space model for MBRL that captures all necessary information at converges, while prioritizing the most functionally relevant factors via the empowerment term.

Our main contribution is InfoPower, a model-based RL algorithm for high-dimensional systems with image observations that integrates empowerment into a mutual information based, nonreconstructive framework for learning state space models. Our approach explicitly prioritizes information that is most likely to be functionally relevant, which significantly improves performance in the presence of time-correlated distractors (e.g., background videos), and also accelerates exploration in environments with sparse rewards. We evaluate the proposed objectives on a suite of simulated robotic control tasks with explicit video distractors, and demonstrate up to  $20\%$  better performance in terms of cumulative rewards at 1M environment interactions with  $30\%$  higher sample efficiency at 100k interactions.

# 2 PROBLEM STATEMENT AND NOTATION

A partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) is a tuple  $(S, \mathcal{A}, T, R, \mathcal{O})$  that consists of states  $s \in S$ , actions  $a \in \mathcal{A}$ , rewards  $r \in R$ , observations  $o \in \mathcal{O}$ , and a state-transition distribution  $T(s'|s, a)$ . In most practical settings, the agent interacting with the environment doesn't have access to the actual states in  $S$ , but to some partial information in the form of observations  $\mathcal{O}$ . The underlying state-transition distribution  $T$  and reward distribution  $R$  are also unknown to the agent.

In this paper, we consider the observations  $o \in \mathcal{O}$  to be high-dimensional images, and so, the agent should learn a compact representation space  $Z$  for the latent state-space model. The problem statement is to learn effective representations from observations  $\mathcal{O}$  when there are visual distractors present in the scene, and plan using the learned representations to maximize the cumulative sum of discounted rewards,  $J = \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t} \gamma^{t-1} r_t]$ . The value of a state  $V(Z_t)$  is defined as the expected cumulative sum of discounted rewards starting at state  $Z_t$ .

We use  $q(\cdot)$  to denote parameterized variational approximations to learned distributions. We denote random variables with captaI letters and use small letters to denote particular realizations (e.g.,  $z_{t}$  denotes the value of  $Z_{t}$ ). Since the underlying distributions are unknown, we evaluate all expectations through Monte-Carlo sampling with observed state-transition tuples  $(o_{t},a_{t - 1},o_{t - 1},z_{t},z_{t - 1},r_{t})$ .

# 3 INFORMATION PRIORITIZATION FOR THE LATENT STATE-SPACE MODEL

Our goal is to learn a latent state-space model with a representation  $Z$  that prioritizes capturing functionally relevant parts of observations  $\mathcal{O}$ , and devise a planning objective that explores with the learned representation. To achieve this, our key insight is integration of empowerment in the visual model-based RL pipeline. For representation learning we maximize  $\mathrm{MI}\max_{Z}I(\mathcal{O},Z)$  subject to a prioritization of the empowerment objective  $\max_{Z}I(A_{t - 1};Z_{t}|Z_{t - 1})$ . For planning, we maximize the empowerment objective along with reward-based value with respect to the policy  $\max_{A}I(A_{t - 1};Z_{t}|Z_{t - 1}) + I(R_{t};Z_{t})$ . In the subsequent sections, we elaborate on our approach, InfoPower, and describe lower bounds to MI that yield a tractable algorithm.

# 3.1 LEARNING CONTROLLABLE FACTORS AND PLANNING THROUGH EMPOWERMENT

Controllable representations are features of the observation that correspond to entities which the agent can influence through its actions. For example, in quadrupedal locomotion, this could include the joint positions, velocities, motor torques, and the configurations of any object in the environment that the robot can interact with. For robotic manipulation, it could include the joint actuators of the robot arm, and the configurations of objects in the scene that it can interact with. Such representations are denoted by  $S^{+}$  in Fig. 2, which we can formally define through conditional independence as a subspace of  $S$ ,  $S^{+} \leq S$ , such that  $I(A_{t-1}; S_t | S_t^{+}) = 0$ . This conditional independence relation can be seen in Fig. 2. We

explicitly prioritize the learning of such representations in the latent space by drawing inspiration from variational empowerment (Mohamed & Rezende, 2015).

Figure 2: PGM showing decomposition of state  $S$  into controllable parts  $S^{+}$  (directly influenced by actions  $A$ ), parts not influenced by actions that still influence the reward,  $\tilde{S}^{-}$ , and distractors  $DS^{-}$ .

The empowerment objective can be cast as maximizing a conditional information term  $I(A_{t-1}; Z_t | Z_{t-1}) = \mathcal{H}(A_{t-1} | Z_{t-1}) - \mathcal{H}(A_{t-1} | Z_t, Z_{t-1})$ . The first term  $\mathcal{H}(A_{t-1} | Z_{t-1})$  encourages the chosen actions to be as diverse as possible, while the second term  $-\mathcal{H}(A_{t-1} | Z_t, Z_{t-1})$  encourages the representations  $Z_t$  and  $Z_{t+1}$  to be such that the action  $A_t$  for transition is predictable. While prior approaches have used empowerment in the model-free setting to learn policies by exploration through intrinsic motivation (Mohamed & Rezende, 2015), we specifically use this objective in combination with MI maximization for prioritizing the learning of controllable representations from distracting images in the latent state-space model.

We include the same empowerment objective in both representation learning and policy learning. For this, we augment the maximization of the latent value function that is standard for policy learning in visual model-based RL (Sutton, 1991), with  $\max_A I(A_{t-1}; Z_t | Z_{t-1})$ . This objectives complements value based-learning and further improves exploration by seeking controllable states. We empirically analyze the benefits of this in sections 4.3 and 4.6.

We next describe two theorems regarding learning controllable representations, with proofs in the Appendix. We observe that the max  $\sum_{t}I(A_{t - 1};\bar{Z}_{t}|Z_{t - 1})$  objective alone for learning latent representations  $Z$ , along with the planning objective provably recovers controllable parts of the observation  $\mathcal{O}$ , namely  $S^{+}$ .

Theorem 1. The objective  $\max \sum_{t} I(A_{t-1}; Z_t | Z_{t-1})$  provably recovers controllable parts  $S^+$  of the observation  $\mathcal{O}$ .  $S^+$  is defined as that part of underlying state  $S$  which is directly influenced by actions  $A$  i.e.  $S^+ \subset S$  s.t.  $I(S_t; A_{t-1} | S_t^+) = 0$ .

This result is important because in practice, we may not be able to represent every possible factor of variation in a complex environment. In this situation, we would expect that when  $|Z| \ll |\mathcal{O}|$ , learning  $Z$  under the objective  $\max \sum_{t} I(A_{t-1}; Z_t | Z_{t-1})$  would encode  $S^+$ . We next show that the inverse information objective alone can be used to train a latent-state space model and a policy through an alternating optimization algorithm that converges to a local minimum of the objective  $\max \sum_{t} I(A_{t-1}; Z_t | Z_{t-1})$  at a rate inversely proportional to the number of iterations.

Theorem 2.  $\max_{\pi, \psi} \sum_t I(A_{t-1}; Z_t | Z_{t-1}) = \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{\pi(a_{t-1} | z_{t-1}) p(z_t | z_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, o_t)} \log \frac{q_{\psi}(a_{t-1} | z_t, z_{t-1})}{\pi(a_{t-1} | z_{t-1})}$  can be optimized through an alternating optimization scheme that has a convergence rate of  $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$  to a local minima of the objective, where  $N$  is the number of iterations.

This result is useful because it shows that even in the absence of rewards from the environment  $(r_t = 0\forall t)$ , when planning to minimize regret is not possible, the inverse information objective can be used to train a policy that explores to seek out controllable parts of the state-space. When rewards from the environment are present, we can train the policy with this objective and the value estimates obtained from the cumulative rewards during planning. In Section 4.3 we empirically show how this objective helps achieve higher sample efficiency compared to pure value-based policy learning.

# 3.2 MUTUAL INFORMATION MAXIMIZATION FOR REPRESENTATION LEARNING

For visual model-based RL, we need to learn a representation space  $Z$ , such that a forward dynamics model defining the probability of the next state in terms of the current state and the current action can be learned. The objective for this is  $\sum_{t} - I(i_{t};Z_{t}|Z_{t - 1},A_{t - 1})$ . Here,  $i_t$  denotes the dataset indices that determine the observations  $p(o_{t}|i_{t}) = \delta (o_{t} - o_{t^{\prime}})$ . In addition to the forward dynamics model, we need to learn a reward predictor by maximizing  $\sum_{t}I(R_{t};Z_{t})$ , such that the agent can plan ahead in the future by rolling forward latent states, without having to execute actions and observe rewards in the real environment.

Finally, we need to learn an encoder for encoding observations  $\mathcal{O}$  to latents  $Z$ . Most successful prior works have used reconstruction-loss as a natural objective for learning this encoder (Babaeizadeh et al., 2017; Hafner et al., 2019b;a). A reconstruction-loss can be motivated by considering the objective  $I(\mathcal{O}, Z)$  and computing its BA lower bound (Agakov, 2004).  $I(o_{t}; z_{t}) \geq \mathbb{E}_{p(o_{t}, z_{t})}[\log q_{\phi'}(o_{t}|z_{t})] + \mathcal{H}(p(o_{t}))$ . The first term here is the reconstruction objective, with  $q_{\phi'}(o_{t}|z_{t})$  being the decoder, and the second term can be ignored as it doesn't depend on  $Z$ . However, this reconstruction objective explicitly encourages encoding the information from every pixel in the latent space (such that reconstructing the image is possible) and hence is prone to not ignoring distractors.

In contrast, if we consider other lower bounds to  $I(\mathcal{O}, Z)$ , we can obtain tractable objectives that do not involve reconstructing high-dimensional images. We can obtain an  $NCE$ -based lower bound (Hjelm et al., 2018):  $I(o_{t}; z_{t}) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z_{t} | o_{t}) p(o_{t})}[\log f_{\theta}(z_{t}, o_{t}) - \log \sum_{t' \neq t} f_{\theta}(z_{t}, o_{t'})]$ , where  $q_{\phi}(z_{t} | o_{t})$  is the learned encoder,  $o_{t}$  is the observation at timestep  $t$  (positive sample), and all observations in the replay buffer  $o_{t'}$  are negative samples.  $f_{\theta}(z_{t}, o_{t'}) = \exp(z_{t}^{T} W_{\theta} z_{t'})$ . The lower-bound is a form of contrastive learning as it maximizes compatibility of  $z_{t}$  with the corresponding observation  $o_{t}$  while minimizing compatibility with all other observations across time and batch.

Although prior work has explored NCE-based bounds for contrastive learning in RL (Srinivas et al., 2020), to the best of our knowledge, prior work has not used this in conjunction with empowerment for prioritizing information in visual model-based RL. Similarly, the Nguyen-Wainwright-Jordan (NWJ) bound (Nguyen et al., 2010), which to the best our knowledge has not been used by prior works in visual model-based RL, can be obtained as,

$$
I (o _ {t}; z _ {t}) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} (z _ {t} | o _ {t}) p (o _ {t})} [ f _ {\theta} (z _ {t}, o _ {t}) ] - e ^ {- 1} \mathbb {E} _ {q _ {\phi} (z _ {t} | o _ {t}) p (o _ {t})} e ^ {f _ {\theta} (z _ {t}, o _ {t})},
$$

where  $f_{\theta}$  is a critic. There exists an optimal critic function for which the bound is tightest and equality holds.

We refer to the InfoNCE and NWJ lower bound based objectives as contrastive learning, in order to distinguish them from a reconstruction-loss based objective, though both are bounds on mutual information. We denote a lower bound to MI by  $\underline{I}(o_t, z_t)$ . We empirically find the NWJ-bound to perform slightly better than the NCE-bound for our approach, explained in section 4.6.

# 3.3 OVERALL OBJECTIVE

We now motivate the overall objective, which consists of maximizing mutual information while prioritizing the learning of controllable representations through empowerment in a latent state-space model. Based on the discussions in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we define the overall objective for representation learning as

$$
\max _ {Z _ {0: H - 1}} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {H - 1} I (\mathcal {O} _ {t}; Z _ {t}) \mathrm {s . t .} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {H - 1} \overbrace {(- I (i _ {t} ; Z _ {t} | Z _ {t - 1} , A _ {t - 1}) + I (A _ {t - 1} ; Z _ {t} | Z _ {t - 1}) + I (R _ {t} ; Z _ {t}))} ^ {\mathcal {C} _ {t}} \geq c _ {0}.
$$

The objective is to maximize a MI term  $I(\mathcal{O}_t;Z_t)$  through contrastive learning such that a constraint on  $C_t$  holds for prioritizing the encoding of forward-predictive, reward-predictive and controllable representations. We define the overall planning objective as

$$
\max  _ {A _ {0: H - 1}} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {H - 1} I (A _ {t - 1}; Z _ {t} | Z _ {t - 1}) + V (Z _ {t}) ; A _ {t} = \pi (Z _ {t}) ; V (Z _ {t}) \approx \sum_ {t} R _ {t}.
$$

The planning objective is to learn a policy as a function of the latent state  $Z$  such that the empowerment term and a reward-based value term are maximized over the horizon  $H$ .

We can perform the constrained optimization for representation learning through the method of Lagrange Multipliers, by the primal and dual updates shown in Section A.2. In order to analyze this objective, let  $|\mathcal{O}| = n$  and  $|Z| = d$ . Since,  $\mathcal{O}$  corresponds to images and  $Z$  is a bottlenecked latent representation,  $d \ll n$ .

$I(\mathcal{O},Z)$  is maximized when  $Z$  contains all the information present in  $\mathcal{O}$  such that  $Z$  is a sufficient statistic of  $\mathcal{O}$ . However, in practice, this is not possible because  $|Z|\ll |\mathcal{O}|$ . When  $c_{0}$  is sufficiently large, and the constraint  $\sum_{t}\mathcal{C}_{t}\geq c_{0}$  is satisfied,  $Z = [S^{+},\tilde{S}^{-}]$ . Hence, the objective  $\max \sum_{t}I(\mathcal{O}_{t},Z_{t})$  s.t.  $\sum_{t}\mathcal{C}_{t}\geq c_{0}$  cannot encode anything else in  $Z$ , in particular it cannot encode distractors  $DS^{-}$ .

To understand the importance of prioritization through  $\mathcal{C}_t\geq c_0$  , consider  $\max \sum_tI(\mathcal{O}_t,Z_t)$  without the constraint. This objective would try to make  $Z$  a sufficient statistic of  $\mathcal{O}$  , but since  $|Z|\ll |\mathcal{O}|$  , there are no guarantees about which parts of  $\mathcal{O}$  are getting encoded in  $Z$  .This is because both distractors  $S^{-}$  and non-distractors  $S^{+},D\tilde{S}^{-}$  are equally important with respect to  $I(\mathcal{O},Z)$  Hence, the constraint helps in prioritizing the type of information to be e

# 3.4 PRACTICAL ALGORITHM AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

To arrive at a practical algorithm, we optimize the overall objective in section 3.3 through lower bounds on each of the MI terms. For  $I(\mathcal{O}, Z)$  we consider two variants, corresponding to the NCE and NWJ lower bounds described in Section 3.2. We can obtain a variational lower bound on each of the terms in  $\mathcal{C}_t$  as follows:

$$
- I (i _ {t}; z _ {t} | a _ {t - 1}) \geq - \sum_ {t} \mathbb {E} [ D _ {\mathrm {K L}} (p (z _ {t} | z _ {t - 1}, a _ {t - 1}, o _ {t}) | | q _ {\chi} (z _ {t} | z _ {t - 1}, a _ {t - 1})) ]
$$

$$
I \left(r _ {t}; z _ {t}\right) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {p \left(r _ {t} \mid o _ {t}\right)} \left[ \log q _ {\eta} \left(r _ {t} \mid z _ {t}\right) \right] + \mathcal {H} \left(p \left(r _ {t}\right)\right)
$$

$$
I \left(a _ {t - 1}; z _ {t} \mid z _ {t - 1}\right) \geq \mathbb {E} _ {p \left(o _ {t} \mid z _ {t - 1}, a _ {t - 1}\right) q _ {\phi} \left(z _ {t} \mid o _ {t}\right)} \left[ \log q _ {\psi} \left(a _ {t - 1} \mid z _ {t}, z _ {t - 1}\right) \right] + \mathbb {E} [ \mathcal {H} (\pi \left(a _ {t - 1} \mid z _ {t - 1}\right)) ]
$$

We denote by  $\underline{C}_t$ , the lower bound to  $\tilde{C}_t$  based on the sum of the terms above. We construct a Lagrangian  $\mathcal{L} = \sum_{t}\underline{I}(o_t;z_t) + \lambda (\underline{C}_t - c_0)$  and optimize it by primal-dual gradient descent.

Planning Objective. For planning to choose actions at every time-step, we learn a policy  $\pi(a|z)$  through value estimates of task reward and the empowerment objective. We learn value estimates with  $V(z_{t}) \approx \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[\ln q_{\eta}(r_{t}|z_{t}) + \ln q_{\psi}(a_{t-1}|z_{t}, z_{t-1})]$ . We estimate  $V(z_{t})$  similar to Equation 6 of (Hafner et al., 2019a). The empowerment term  $q_{\psi}(a_{t-1}|z_{t}, z_{t-1})$  in policy learning incentivizes choosing actions  $a_{t-1}$  such that they can be predicted from consecutive latent states  $z_{t-1}, z_{t}$ . This biases the policy to explore controllable regions of the state-space. The policy is trained to maximize the estimate of the value, while the value model is trained to fit the estimate of the value that changes as the policy is updated.

Finally, we note that the difference in value function of the underlying MDP  $Q^{\pi}(o,a)$  and the latent MDP  $\hat{Q}^{\pi}(z,a)$ , where  $z\sim q_{\phi}(z|o)$  is bounded, under some regularity assumptions. We provide this result in Theorem 3 of the Appendix Section A.5. The overall procedure for model learning, planning, and interacting with the environment is outlined in Algorithm 1.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

Through experiments on robot control tasks, we aim to understand the following research questions:

1. How does InfoPower compare with the baselines in terms of episodic returns in environments with explicit background video distractors?  
2. How sample efficient is InfoPower when the reward signal is weak ( $< 100k$  env steps)?  
3. How does InfoPower compare with baselines in terms of behavioral similarity of latent states?

# 4.1 SETUP

We perform experiments with modified DeepMind Control Suite environments (Tassa et al., 2018), with natural video distractors in the background. The agent receives only image observations at each timestep and does not receive the ground-truth simulator state. This is a very challenging setting, because the agents must learn to ignore the distractors and abstract out representations necessary for control. While natural videos that are unrelated to the task might be easy to ignore, realistic scenes might have other elements that resemble the controllable elements, but are not actually controllable (e.g., other cars in a driving scenario). To emulate this, we also add distractors that resemble other potentially controllable robots, as shown for example in Fig. 3 (1st and 6th), but are not actually influenced by actions.

Some video backgrounds (for example the top left and the bottom right) have more complex distractors in the form of agent-behind-agent i.e. the background has pre-recorded motion of a similar agent that is being controlled.

We compare InfoPower with state-of-the-art baselines that also learn world models for control: Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2019a), C-Dreamer that is a contrastive version of Dreamer similar to Ma et al. (2020), TIA (Fu et al., 2021) that learns explicit reconstructions for both the distracting background and agent separately, a model-based version of DBC (Zhang et al., 2020), and DeepMDP (Gelada et al., 2019). We also compare variants of InfoPower with different MI bounds (NCE and NWJ), and ablations of it by removing the empowerment objective from policy learning.

# 4.2 A BEHAVIORAL SIMILARITY METRIC BASED ON GRAPH KERNELS

In order to measure how good the learned latent representations are at capturing the functionally relevant elements in the scene, we introduce a behavioral similarity metric with details in A.6. Given the sets  $S_{z} = \{z^{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$  and  $S_{z_{\mathrm{gt}}} = \{z_{\mathrm{gt}}^{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ , we construct complete graphs by connecting every vertex with every other vertex through an edge. The weight of an edge is the Euclidean distance between the respective pairs of vertices. The label of each vertex is an unique integer and corresponding vertices in the two graphs are labelled similarly.

Let the resulting graphs be denoted as  $G_{z} = (V_{z},E_{z})$  and  $G_{z_{\mathrm{gt}}} = (V_{z_{\mathrm{gt}}},E_{z_{\mathrm{gt}}})$  respectively. Note that both these

graphs are shortest path graphs, by construction. Let,  $e_i = \{u_i, v_i\}$  and  $e_j = \{u_j, v_j\}$ . We define the shortest path kernel to measure similarity between the two graphs, as,  $k(G_z, G_{z_{\mathrm{gt}}}) = \frac{1}{|E_z|} \sum_{e_i \in E_z} \sum_{e_j \in E_{z_{\mathrm{gt}}}} \hat{k}(e_i, e_j)$ . Here, the kernel  $\hat{k}$  measures similarity between the edges  $e_i, e_j$  and the labels on respective vertices. Such that the value of  $k(G_z, G_{z_{\mathrm{gt}}})$  is low when a large number of pairs of corresponding vertices in both the graphs have the same edge length. We expect methods that recover latent state representations which better reflect the true underlying simulator state (i.e., the positions of the joints) to have higher values according to this metric.

# 4.3 SAMPLE EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

In Fig. 5, we compare InfoPower and the baselines in terms of episodic returns. This version of InfoPower corresponds to an NWJ bound on MI which we find works slightly better than the

NCE bound variant analyzed in section 4.6. It is evident that InfoPower achieves higher returns before 1M steps of training quickly compared to the baselines, indicating higher sample efficiency. This suggests the effectiveness of the empowerment model in helping capture controllable representations early on during training, when the agent doesn't take on actions that yield very high rewards.

# 4.4 RESULT ON VARYING DISTRACTOR LEVELS

We consider different levels of distractors by varying the size of the window where distractors in the background are active. Fig. 10 in the Appendix illustrates this visually. Table 1 shows results for the different approaches on varying distractor levels. The window sizes for distractors at levels L1, L2, and L3 respectively are  $32 \times 32$ ,  $40 \times 40$ , and  $64 \times 64$ . We observe that the baselines perform worse as the distractor window size increases. While, for InfoPower, the performance decreases with increasing level is minimal. This indicates the effectiveness of InfoPower in filtering out background distractors from the observations while learning latent representations.

# 4.5 BEHAVIORAL SIMILARITY OF LATENT STATES

In this section, we analyze how similar are the learned latent representations with respect to the underlying simulator states. The intuition for this comparison is that the proprioceptive features in the simulator state abstract out distractors in the image, and so we want the latent states to be behaviorally similar to the simulator states.

Figure 6: t-SNE plot of latent states  $z \sim q_{\phi}(z|o)$  with visualizations of three nearest neighbors for two randomly sampled points (in red frame). We see that the state of the agent is similar in each set for InfoPower, whereas for Dreamer, and the most competitive baseline C-Dreamer, the nearest neighbor frames have significantly different agent configurations.

Quantitative results with the defined metric. In Table 1, we show results for behavioral similarity of latent states (Sim), based on the metric in section 4.2. We see that the value of Sim for InfoPower is around  $20\%$  higher than the most competitive baseline, indicating high behavioral similarity of the latent states with respect to the corresponding ground-truth simulator states.

Qualitative visualizations with t-sne. Fig. 6 shows a t-SNE plot of latent states  $z \sim q_{\phi}(z|o)$  for InfoPower and the baselines with visualizations of 3 nearest neighbors for two randomly chosen latent states. We see that the state of the agent is similar in each group for InfoPower, although the background scenes are significantly different. However, for the baselines, the nearest neighbor states are significantly different in terms of the pose of the agent, indicating that the latent representations encode significant background information.

# 4.6 ABLATION STUDIES

In Fig. 7, we compare different ablations of InfoPower. Keeping everything else the same, and changing only the MI lower bound to NCE, we see that the performance is almost similar or slightly worse. However, when we remove the empowerment objective from policy optimization (the versions with 'Policy' in the plot), we see that performance drops. The drop is significant in the regions  $< 200k$  environment interactions, particularly in the sparse reward environments - cartpole balance and ball in a cup, indicating the necessity of the empowerment objective in exploration for learning controllable representations, when the reward signal is weak.

# 5 RELATED WORKS

Visual model-based RL. Recent developments in video prediction and contrastive learning have enabled learning of world-models from images (Watter et al., 2015; Babaeizadeh et al., 2017; Finn & Levine, 2017; Hafner et al., 2019a; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Hafner et al., 2019b; Xie et al., 2020). All of these approaches learn latent representations through reconstruction objectives that are amenable for planning. Other approaches have used similar reconstruction based objectives for control, but not for MBRL (Lee et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019).

MI for representation learning. Mutual Information measures the dependence between two random variables. The task of learning latent representations  $Z$  from images  $\mathcal{O}$  for downstream applications, has been very successful with MI objectives of the form  $\max_{f_1,f_2}I(f_1(\mathcal{O}),f_2(Z))$  (Hjelm & Bachman, 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Oord et al., 2018; Tschannen et al., 2019; Nachum & Yang, 2021). Since calculating MI exactly is intractable optimizing MI based objectives, it is important to construct appropriate MI estimators that lower-bound the true MI objective (Hjelm et al., 2018;

The x-axis denotes the number of environment interactions and the y-axis shows the episodic returns. InfoPower-NWJ and InfoPower-NCE are full versions of our method differing only in the MI lower bound. The versions with - Policy do not include the empowerment objective in policy learning, but only use it from representation learning. The S.D is over 4 random seeds. Higher is better.

Nguyen et al., 2010; Belghazi et al., 2018; Agakov, 2004). The choice of the estimator is crucial, as shown by recent works (Poole et al., 2019), and different estimators yield very different behaviors of the algorithm. We incorporate MI maximization through the NCE (Hjelm et al., 2018) and NWJ (Nguyen et al., 2010) lower bounds, such that typical reconstruction objectives for representation learning which do not perform well with visual distractors, can be avoided.

Inverse models and empowerment. Prior approaches have used inverse dynamics models for regularization in representation learning (Agrawal et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018) and as bonuses for improving policy gradient updates in RL (Shelhamer et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2017). Empowerment (Mohamed & Rezende, 2015) has been used as exploration bonuses for policy learning (Leibfried et al., 2019; Klyubin et al., 2008), and for learning skills in RL (Gregor et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2019; Eysenbach et al., 2018). In contrast to prior work, we incorporate empowerment both for state space representation learning and policy learning, in a visual model-based RL framework, with the aim of prioritizing the most functionally relevant information in the scene.

RL with environment distractors. Some recent RL frameworks have studied the problem of abstracting out only the task relevant information from the environment when there are explicit distractors (Hansen & Wang, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2020). Zhang et al. (2020) constrain the latent states by enforcing a bisimulation metric, without a reconstruction objective. Fu et al. (2021) model both the relevant and irrelevant aspects of the environment separately, and differ from our approach that prioritizes learning only the relevant aspects. Ma et al. (2020) use contrastive learning instead of reconstruction for training the encoder, but does not explicitly ignore distractors. Incorporating a lot of data augmentations for improving robustness with respect to environment variations is an orthogonal line of work (Laskin et al., 2020; Hansen & Wang, 2020; Raileanu et al., 2020; Srinivas et al., 2020), complementary to our approach.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this paper we derived an approach for visual model-based RL such that an agent can learn a latent state-space model and a policy by explicitly prioritizing the encoding of functionally relevant factors. Our prioritized information objective integrates a term inspired by variational empowerment into an objective performing MI without reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on a suite of vision-based robot control tasks with challenging video distractor backgrounds. In comparison to state-of-the-art model-based RL methods, we observe an average of  $20\%$  higher episodic returns at 1M environment interactions with  $30\%$  higher sample efficiency at 100k interactions.
