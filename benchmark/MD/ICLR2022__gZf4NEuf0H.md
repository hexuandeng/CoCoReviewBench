# ABSTRACT

Implicit regularization is important for understanding the learning of neural networks (NNs). Empirical works show that input weights of hidden neurons (the input weight of a hidden neuron consists of the weight from its input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) condense on isolated orientations with a small initialization. The condensation dynamics implies that the training implicitly regularizes a NN towards one with much smaller effective size. In this work, we utilize multilayer networks to show that the maximal number of condensed orientations in the initial training stage is twice the multiplicity of the activation function, where "multiplicity" is multiple roots of activation function at origin. Our theoretical analysis confirms experiments for two cases, one is for the activation function of multiplicity one, which contains many common activation functions, and the other is for the layer with one-dimensional input. This work makes a step towards understanding how small initialization implicitly leads NNs to condensation at initial training stage, which lays a foundation for the future study of the nonlinear dynamics of NNs and its implicit regularization effect at a later stage of training.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Over-parameterized neural networks often show good generalization performance on real-world problems by minimizing loss functions without explicit regularization (Breiman, 1995; Zhang et al., 2017). For over-parameterized NNs, there are infinite possible sets of training parameters that can reach a satisfying training loss. However, their generalization performances can be very different. It is important to study what implicit regularization is imposed aside to the loss function during the training that leads the NN to a specific type of solutions.

Empirical works suggest that NNs may learn the data from simple to complex patterns (Arpit et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Rahaman et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Kalimeris et al., 2019). For example, an implicit bias of frequency principle is widely observed that NNs often learn the target function from low to high frequency (Xu et al., 2019; Rahaman et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020). Frequency principle inspires a series of algorithms for fast learning high frequency (Xu et al., 2020; Jagtap et al., 2020; Biland et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Cai & Xu, 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Wang, 2020; Tancik et al., 2020; Mildenhall et al., 2020; Agarwal et al., 2020; Campo et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Xi et al., 2020) and has been utilized to understand various phenomena emerging in applications of deep learning (Ma et al., 2020; Sharma & Ross, 2020; Zhu et al., 2019; Chakrabarty & Maji, 2019; Xu & Zhou, 2021) The NN output, either simple or complex, is a collective result of all neurons. The study of how neuron weights evolve during the training is central to understanding the collective behavior, including the complexity, of the NN output.

Luo et al. (2021) establish a phase diagram to study the effect of initialization on weight evolution for two-layer ReLU NNs at the infinite-width limit and find that the neural tangent kernel (NTK) initialization and the mean-field initialization are special cases of the linear regime and the critical regime, respectively. Aside from the linear and the critical regime in the phase diagram is a largely unexplored non-linear regime. This non-linear regime is named as condensed regime because the input weights of hidden neurons (the input weight or the feature of a hidden neuron consists of the weight from its input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) condense on isolated orientations

during the training (Luo et al., 2021). The three regimes in the phase diagram, i.e., linear regime, critical regime and condensed regime, are identified based on the relative change of input weights as the width approaches infinity, which tends to  $0$ ,  $O(1)$  and  $+\infty$ , respectively.

The condensation is a feature learning process, which is important to the learning of DNNs. Note that in the following, condensation is accompanied by a default assumption of small initialization or large relative change of input weights during training. For practical networks, such as resnet18-like (He et al., 2016) in learning CIFAR10, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and Table 1, we find that the performance of networks with initialization in the condensed regime is very similar to the common initialization methods. However, the condensation phenomenon provides an intuitive explanation of the good performance as follows, which may lead to a quantitatively theory explanation in future work. The condensation transforms a large network to a network of only a few effective neurons, leading to an output function with low complexity. Since the complexity bounds the generalization error (Bartlett & Mendelson, 2002), the study of condensation could provide insight to how NNs are implicitly regularized to achieve good generalization performance in practice.

For two-layer ReLU NN, Maennel et al. (2018) prove that, as the initialization of parameters goes to zero, the features of hidden neurons condense at finite number of orientations depending on the input data; when performing a linearly separable classification task with infinite data, Pellegrini & Biroli (2020) show that at mean-field limit, a two-layer infinite-width ReLU NN is effectively equal to a NN of one hidden neuron, i.e., condensation on a single orientation. Both works (Maennel et al., 2018; Pellegrini & Biroli, 2020) study the condensation behavior for ReLU-NNs at an initial training stage in which the magnitudes of NN parameters are far smaller from well-fitting an  $O(1)$  target function. However, it still remains unclear that for NNs of more general activation functions, how the condensation emerges at the initial training stage.

In this work, we show that the condensation at the initial stage is closely related to the multiplicity  $p$  at  $x = 0$ , which means the derivative of activation at  $x = 0$  is zero up to the  $(p - 1)th$ -order and is non-zero for the  $p$ -th order. To verify their relation, we use the common activation function sigmoid(x), softplus(x), tanh(x), which are multiplicity one, and variants of  $\tanh(x)$  for our experiments. The most simple way to increase the multiplicity of a function is to multiply the function with  $x$ . Therefore, the variants we use are  $x \tanh(x)$  and  $x^2 \tanh(x)$ . For comparison, we also show the initial condensation of  $\mathrm{ReLU}(x)$ , which is studied previously (Maennel et al., 2018) and has totally different properties at origin compared with  $\tanh(x)$ . Our experiments suggest that the maximal number of condensed orientations is twice the multiplicity of the activation function used in general NNs. For finite-width two-layer NNs with small initialization at the initial training stage, each hidden neuron's output in a finite domain around 0 can be approximated by a  $p$ -th order polynomial and so is the NN output function. Based on the  $p$ -th order approximation, we show a preliminary theoretical support for condensation by a theoretical analysis for two cases, one is for the activation function of multiplicity one, which contains many common activation functions, and the other is for the layer with one-dimensional input. Therefore, small initialization imposes an implicit regularization that restricts the NN to be effectively much narrower neural network at the initial training stage. As commonly used activation functions, such as  $\tanh(x)$ , sigmoid(x), softplus(x), etc., are all multiplicity one, our study of initial training behavior lays an important basis for the further study of implicit regularization throughout the training.

# 2 RELATED WORKS

A research line studies how initialization affects the weight evolution of NNs with a sufficiently large or infinite width. For example, with an initialization in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime or lazy training regime (weights change slightly during the training), the gradient flow of infinite-width NN, can be approximated by a linear dynamics of random feature model (Jacot et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; E et al., 2020; Chizat & Bach, 2019), whereas for the initialization in the mean-field regime (weights change significantly during the training), the gradient flow of infinite-width NN exhibits highly nonlinear dynamics (Mei et al., 2019; Rotskoff & Vanden-Eijnden, 2018; Chizat & Bach, 2018; Sirignano & Spiliopoulos, 2020). Pellegrini & Biroli (2020) analyze how the dynamics of each parameter transforms from a lazy regime (NTK initialization) to a rich regime (mean-field initialization) for an two-layer infinite-width ReLU NN to perform a linearly separable classification task with infinite data. Luo et al. (2021) systematically study the effect of initialization for two-layer ReLU NN with infinite width by establishing a phase diagram, which shows three distinct regimes, i.e., linear regime (similar to the lazy regime), critical regime and condensed regime (similar to the rich regime), based on the relative change of input weights as the width approaches infinity, which tends to  $0$ ,  $O(1)$  and  $+\infty$ , respectively. NTK initialization is a specific example of the linear regime, while the mean-field initialization is a specific example of the critical regime, which serves as the boundary between the other two regimes. Luo et al. (2021) also empirically find that, in the condensed regime, the features of hidden neurons (orientation of the input weight) condense in several isolated orientations, which is a strong feature learning behavior, an important characteristic of deep learning.

# 3 PRELIMINARY: NEURAL NETWORKS

A two-layer NN is

$$
f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\boldsymbol {x}) = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} a _ {j} \sigma \left(\boldsymbol {w} _ {j} \cdot \boldsymbol {x}\right), \tag {1}
$$

where  $\sigma (\cdot)$  is the activation function,  $\pmb{w}_j = (\bar{\pmb{w}}_j,\pmb {b}_j)\in \mathbb{R}^{d + 1}$  is the neuron feature including the input weight and bias terms, and  $\pmb {x} = (\bar{\pmb{x}},1)\in \mathbb{R}^{d + 1}$  is combination of the input sample and scalar

1,  $\theta$  is the set of all parameters, i.e.,  $\{a_j, w_j\}_{j=1}^m$ . For simplicity, we call  $w_j$  as input weight or weight and  $x$  as input sample.

A  $L$ -layer NN can be recursively defined by feeding the output of the previous layer as the input to the current hidden layer i.e.,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \boldsymbol {x} ^ {[ 0 ]} = (\boldsymbol {x}, 1), \quad \boldsymbol {x} ^ {[ 1 ]} = (\sigma (\boldsymbol {W} ^ {[ 1 ]} \boldsymbol {x} ^ {[ 0 ]}), 1), \quad \boldsymbol {x} ^ {[ l ]} = (\sigma (\boldsymbol {W} ^ {[ l ]} \boldsymbol {x} ^ {[ l - 1 ]}), 1), \text {f o r} l \in \{2, 3, \dots , L \} \\ f (\boldsymbol {\theta}, \boldsymbol {x}) = \frac {1}{\alpha} \mathbf {a} ^ {\intercal} \boldsymbol {x} ^ {[ L ]} \triangleq f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\boldsymbol {x}), \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\pmb{W}^{[l]} = (\bar{\pmb{W}}^{[l]},\pmb{b}^{[l]})\in \mathbb{R}^{m_l\times (m_{l - 1} + 1)}$ , and  $m_l$  represents the dimension of the  $l$ -th hidden layer. For simplicity, we also call each row of  $\pmb{W}^{[l]}$  as input weight or weight and  $\pmb{x}^{[l - 1]}$  as input neurons. The target function is denoted as  $f^{*}(\pmb {x})$ . The training loss function is mean squared error

$$
R _ {S} (\boldsymbol {\theta}) = \frac {1}{2 n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left(f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} \left(\boldsymbol {x} _ {i}\right) - f ^ {*} \left(\boldsymbol {x} _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {2}. \tag {3}
$$

We consider the gradient flow training

$$
\dot {\boldsymbol {\theta}} = - \nabla_ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} R _ {S} (\boldsymbol {\theta}). \tag {4}
$$

For convenience, we characterize the activation function by the following definition.

Definition 1 (multiplicity  $p$ ). Suppose that  $\sigma(x)$  satisfies the following condition, there exists a  $p \in \mathbb{N}$  and  $p \geq 1$ , such that the  $k$ -th order derivative  $\sigma^{(k)}(0) = 0$  for  $k = 1, 2, \dots, p - 1$ , and  $\sigma^{(p)}(0) \neq 0$ , then we say  $\sigma$  has multiplicity  $p$ .

# 4 INITIAL CONDENSATION OF INPUT WEIGHTS

It is intuitively believed that NNs are powerful at learning data features, which should be an important reason behind the success of deep learning. A simple way to define a learned feature of a neuron is by the orientation of its input weights. Previous work in Luo et al. (2021) show that there is a condensed regime, where the neuron features condense on isolated orientations during the training for two-layer ReLU NNs. The condensation implies that although there are many more neurons than samples, the number of effective neurons, i.e., the number of different used features in fitting, is often much smaller than the number of samples. Therefore, the condensation provides a potential mechanism that helps over-parameterized NNs avoid overfitting. However, it is still unclear how the condensation, for general NNs with small initialization, emerges during the training. In this section, we would empirically show how the condensation differs among NNs with activation functions of different multiplicities, followed by theoretical analysis in the next section.

# 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Throughout this work, we use fully-connected neural network with size,  $d - m - \dots -m - d_{out}$ . The input dimension  $d$  is determined by the training data. The output dimension is  $d_{out} = 1$  for all experiments. The number of hidden neurons  $m$  is specified in each experiment. All parameters are initialized by a Gaussian distribution  $N(0, var)$ . The total data size is  $n$ . The training method is Adam with full batch expect for the Resnet18-like NN, learning rate  $lr$  and MSE loss. For synthetic data, we sample the training data uniformly from a sub-domain of  $\mathbb{R}^d$ . The real datasets are MNIST and CIFAR10.

# 4.2 MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATA

We first show the condensation at initial training stage in fitting multidimensional dataset. Since the input is a multidimensional vector, the direction is also multidimensional. To characterize the condensation, we use  $D(\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v})$  to denote the inner product of the normalized vectors of two input weights, i.e.,  $D(\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v}) = \boldsymbol{u}^{\mathsf{T}}\boldsymbol{v}$ .

The activation functions are indicated by the sub-captions. The training data is 80 points sampled from  $\sum_{k=1}^{5} 3.5 \sin(5x_k + 1)$ , where each  $x_k$  is uniformly sampled from  $[-4,2]$ .  $n = 80$ ,  $d = 5$ ,  $m = 50$ ,  $d_{out} = 1$ ,  $var = 0.005^2$ ,  $lr = 10^{-3}$ ,  $8 \times 10^{-4}$ ,  $2.5 \times 10^{-4}$  for (a-d), (e) and (f), respectively.

(f)softplus(x)

We use a two-layer fully-connected NN with size 5-50-1 to fit  $n = 80$  training data sampled from a 5-dimensional function  $\sum_{k=1}^{5} 3.5 \sin(5x_k + 1)$ , where  $x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_5)^{\mathsf{T}} \in \mathbb{R}^5$  and each  $x_k$  is uniformly sampled from  $[-4, 2]$ . As shown in Fig. 2(a), for activation function  $\tanh(x)$ , the color indicates  $D(u, v)$  of two hidden neurons' weights at epoch 100, whose indexes are indicated by the abscissa and the ordinate, respectively. If the neurons are in the same beige block,  $D(u, v) \sim 1$  (navy-blue block,  $D(u, v) \sim -1$ ), their input weights have the same (opposite) direction. Obviously, input weights of hidden neurons condense at two opposite directions, i.e., one line. As the multiplicity increasing, NNs with  $x \tanh(x)$  (Fig. 2(b)) and  $x^2 \tanh(x)$  (Fig. 2(c)) condense at two and three different lines, respectively. For activation function  $\text{sigmoid}(x)$  in Fig. 2(d) and  $\text{softplus}(x)$  in Fig. 2(e), which are frequently used and have multiplicity one, NNs also condense at two opposite directions. For ReLU in Fig. 2(f), for which the multiplicity definition cannot apply, the NN condenses at three directions, in which two are opposite. Through these experiments, we conjecture that the maximal number of condensed orientations is twice the multiplicity of the activation function used at initial training.

For multilayer NNs with different activation functions, we show that the condensation for all hidden layers is similar to the two-layer NNs. In deep networks, residual connection is often introduced to overcome the vanishing of gradient. To show the generality of condensation, we perform an experiment of six-layer NNs with residual connections. To show the difference of various activation functions, we set the activation functions for hidden layer 1 to hidden layer 5 as  $x^{2} \tanh(x)$ ,  $x \tanh(x)$ , sigmoid(x),  $\tanh(x)$  and softplus(x) respectively. The structure of the residual is  $h_{l+1}(x) = \sigma(W_l h_l(x) + b_l) + h_l(x)$ , where  $h_l(x)$  is the output of the  $l$ -th layer. As shown in Fig. 3, input weights condense at three, two, one, one and one lines for hidden layer 1 to hidden layer 5, respectively, which is consistent with the condensation of two-layer NNs. Note that residual connections are not necessary. We show an experiment of the same structure as in Fig. 7 but without residual connections in Appendix. To show the universality of condensation, we train resnet18-like neural networks to learn CIFAR10. We study the condensation of the first fully connected layer of the network, using ReLU and  $x \tanh(x)$  as the activation functions and initialization distribution  $N(0, (\frac{1}{m^{1.5}})^2)$ . As shown in Fig. 1 (b) and (c), the condensations for activation  $\mathrm{ReLU}(x)$  and  $x \tanh(x)$  are consistent with Fig. 2 and our conjecture.

We also find that when the training data is less oscillated, the NN may condense at fewer directions. For example, as shown in Fig. 4(a), compared with the high frequency function in Fig. 2, we only

change the target function to be a lower-frequency function, i.e.,  $\sum_{k=1}^{5} 3.5 \sin(2x_k + 1)$ . In this case, the NN with  $x^2 \tanh(x)$  only condenses at three directions, in which two are opposite. For MNIST data in Fig. 4(b), we find that, the NN with  $x^2 \tanh(x)$  condenses at one line, which may suggest that the function for fitting MNIST dataset is a low-frequency function.

To understand the mechanism of the initial condensation, we turn to experiments of 1-d input and two-layer NN, which can be clearly visualized in the next subsection.

# 4.3 1-D INPUT AND TWO-LAYER NN

For 1-d data, we visualize the evolution of the two-layer NN output and each weight, which confirms the connection between the condensation and the multiplicity of the activation function.

We display the outputs at initial training, epoch 1000, in Fig. 5. Due to the small magnitude of parameters, an activation function with multiplicity  $p$  can be well approximated by a  $p$ -th order polynomial, thus, the NN output can also be approximated by a  $p$ -th order polynomial. As shown in Fig. 5(a-c), the NN outputs with activation functions  $\tanh(x)$ ,  $x \tanh(x)$  and  $x^2 \tanh(x)$  overlap well with the auxiliary of a linear, a quadratic and a cubic polynomial curve, respectively. In Fig. 5(d), the NN output with ReLU activation function deviates from a linear function (red auxiliary line). Particularly, the NN output has several sharp turning points. This experiment, although simple,

We visualize the direction field for input weight  $\boldsymbol{w}_j \coloneqq (w_j, b_j)$ , following the gradient flow,

$$
\dot {\boldsymbol {w}} _ {j} = - \frac {a _ {j}}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \sigma^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {w} _ {j} \cdot \boldsymbol {x} _ {i}) \boldsymbol {x} _ {i},
$$

where  $e_i \coloneqq f_\theta(\pmb{x}_i) - f^*(\pmb{x}_i)$ . Since we only care about the direction of  $\pmb{w}_j$  and  $a_j$  is a scalar at each epoch, we can visualize  $\dot{\pmb{w}}_j$  by  $\dot{\pmb{w}}_j / a_j$ . For simplicity, we do not distinguish  $\dot{\pmb{w}}_j / a_j$  and  $\dot{\pmb{w}}_j$  if there is no ambiguity. When we compute  $\dot{\pmb{w}}_j$  for different  $j$ 's,  $e_i \pmb{x}_i$  for  $(i = 1, \dots, n)$  is independent with  $j$ . Then, at each epoch, for a set of  $\{e_i, \pmb{x}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ , we can consider the following direction field

$$
\dot {\boldsymbol {\omega}} = - \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} \sigma^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {\omega} \cdot \boldsymbol {x} _ {i}).
$$

When  $\omega$  is set as  $w_{j}$ , we can obtain  $\dot{w}_{j}$ . As shown in Fig. 6, around the original point, the field has one, two, three stables lines, on which a neuron would keep its direction, for  $\tanh(x)$ ,  $x \tanh(x)$ , and  $x^{2} \tanh(x)$ , respectively. We also display the input weight of each neuron on the field by the green dots and their corresponding velocity directions by the orange arrows. Similarly to the high-dimensional cases, NNs with multiplicity  $p$  activation functions condense at  $p$  different lines for  $p = 1, 2, 3$ . Therefore, It is reasonable to conjecture that the maximal number of condensed orientations is twice the multiplicity of the activation function used. As shown in Fig. 6(d), the field and the condensation for the NN with  $\mathrm{ReLU}(x)$  is much more complex.

Taken together, we have empirically shown that the multiplicity of the activation function is a key factor that determines the complexity of the initial output and initial condensation.

# 5 ANALYSIS OF THE INITIAL CONDENSATION OF INPUT WEIGHTS

In this section, we would present a preliminary analysis to understand how the multiplicity of the activation function affects the initial condensation. At each training step, we consider the velocity field of weights in each hidden layer of a neural networks.

Considering a network with  $L$  hidden layers, we use row vector  $\mathbf{W}_j^{[k]}$  to represent the weight from the  $(k-1)$ -th layer to the  $j$ -th neuron in the  $k$ -th layer. For each  $k$  and  $j$ ,  $\mathbf{W}_j^{[k]}$  satisfies the following dynamics, (see Appendix)

$$
\dot {r} = \boldsymbol {u} \cdot \dot {\boldsymbol {w}}, \quad \dot {\boldsymbol {u}} = \frac {\dot {\boldsymbol {w}} - (\dot {\boldsymbol {w}} \cdot \boldsymbol {u}) \boldsymbol {u}}{r}. \tag {5}
$$

where  $\pmb{w}$  can be  $\pmb{W}_j^{[k]^{\intercal}}$  for all  $k$ 's and  $j$ 's,  $r = \| \pmb{w} \|_2$  is the amplitude, and  $\pmb{u} = \pmb{w} / r$ .

Suppose the activation function has multiplicity  $p$ , i.e.,  $\sigma^{(k)}(0) = 0$  for  $k = 1,2,\dots ,p - 1$ , and  $\sigma^{(p)}(0)\neq 0$ . For convenience, we define an operator  $\mathcal{P}$  satisfying  $\mathcal{P}\boldsymbol {w}\coloneqq \dot{\boldsymbol{w}} -\boldsymbol {u}(\dot{\boldsymbol{w}}\cdot \boldsymbol {u})$ . Condensation refers to that the weight evolves towards a direction that will not change in the direction field and is defined as follows,

$$
\dot {\boldsymbol {u}} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \mathcal {P} \boldsymbol {w} := \dot {\boldsymbol {w}} - \boldsymbol {u} (\dot {\boldsymbol {w}} \cdot \boldsymbol {u}) = 0.
$$

Since  $\dot{\boldsymbol{w}}\cdot \boldsymbol{u}$  is a scalar,  $\dot{\boldsymbol{w}}$  is parallel with  $\boldsymbol{u}$ .  $\boldsymbol{u}$  is a unit vector, therefore, we have  $\boldsymbol{u} = \dot{\boldsymbol{w}} / \| \dot{\boldsymbol{w}} \|_2$ . In this work, we consider NNs with sufficiently small parameters. For example, suppose  $r = \| \boldsymbol{w} \|_2 \sim O(\epsilon)$ ,  $\epsilon$  is a small quantity. Dynamics (5) shows that  $O(\dot{r}) \sim O(\dot{\boldsymbol{w}})$  and  $O(\dot{\boldsymbol{u}}) \sim O(\dot{r}) / O(\epsilon)$ . Therefore, the orientation  $\boldsymbol{u}$  would move much more quickly than the amplitude  $r$ . In the following, we study the case of (i)  $p = 1$  and (ii)  $m_l = 1$ .

# 5.1 CASE  $1\colon p = 1$

Since we have (see Appendix),

$$
\boldsymbol {w} ^ {\intercal} = \dot {\boldsymbol {W}} _ {j} ^ {[ k ]} = - \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} (f (\boldsymbol {\theta}, \boldsymbol {x} _ {i}) - y _ {i}) [ \mathrm {d i a g} \{\sigma^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {W} ^ {[ k ]} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) \} (E ^ {[ k + 1: L ]} \mathbf {a}) ] _ {j} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ] ^ {\intercal}},
$$

where we use  $E^{l} = \mathbf{W}^{[l]^{\intercal}}\mathrm{diag}\{\sigma^{\prime}(\mathbf{W}^{[l]}\mathbf{x}^{[l - 1]})\}$ , for  $l\in \{2,3,\dots,L\}$ ,  $E^{[q:p]} = E^{q}E^{q + 1}\ldots E^{p}$ .

For a fixed step, we only consider the gradient w.r.t.  $\dot{\pmb{W}}_j^{[k]}$ . Suppose  $\sigma'(0) \neq 0$  and parameters are small. Denote  $e_i := (f(\pmb{\theta}, \pmb{x}_i) - y_i)$ . By Taylor expansion,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {P} \boldsymbol {w} \stackrel {\text {l e a d i n g o r d e r}} {\approx} \mathcal {Q} \boldsymbol {w} := - \frac {1}{n} (\operatorname {d i a g} \left\{\sigma^ {\prime} (\boldsymbol {0}) \right\} (E ^ {[ k + 1: L ]} \boldsymbol {a})) _ {j} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} \\ + \left(\frac {1}{n} (\operatorname {d i a g} \{\sigma^ {\prime} (\mathbf {0}) \} (E ^ {[ k + 1: L ]} \mathbf {a})) _ {j} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} \cdot \boldsymbol {u}\right) \boldsymbol {u} = 0, \\ \end{array}
$$

where operator  $\mathcal{Q}$  is the leading-order approximation of operator  $\mathcal{P}$ , and here  $E^{[k + 1:L]}$  is independent with  $i$  because  $\mathrm{diag}\{\sigma'(\pmb{W}^{[l]}\pmb{x}^{[l - 1]})\} \approx \mathrm{diag}\{\sigma'(0)\}$ . Since  $\mathrm{diag}\{\sigma'(\mathbf{0})\} = \mathbf{I}$ , and, WLOG, we assume  $a \neq 0$ , then

$$
\mathcal {Q} \boldsymbol {w} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} = \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} \cdot \boldsymbol {u}\right) \boldsymbol {u}.
$$

We have

$$
\boldsymbol {u} = \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}}{\| \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} \| _ {2}} o r \boldsymbol {u} = - \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}}{\| \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} \| _ {2}}.
$$

This calculation shows that for layer  $k$ , the input weights for any hidden neuron  $j$  have the same two stable directions. Therefore, when parameters are sufficiently small, which implies that the orientation  $u$  would move much more quickly than the amplitude  $r$ , all input weights towards converging to the same direction or the opposite direction, i.e., condensation on a line.

# 5.2 CASE 2:  $m_{l} = 1$

By the definition of the multiplicity  $p$ , we have

$$
\sigma^ {\prime} (\pmb {w} \cdot \pmb {x} _ {i}) = \frac {\sigma^ {(p)} (0)}{(p - 1) !} (\pmb {w} \cdot \pmb {x} _ {i}) ^ {p - 1} + o ((\pmb {w} \cdot \pmb {x} _ {i}) ^ {p - 1}).
$$

where  $(\cdot)^{p - 1}$  and  $\sigma^p (\cdot)$  operate on component here. Then up to the leading order in terms of the magnitude of  $\theta$ , we have (see Appendix)

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathcal {P} \boldsymbol {w} \stackrel {\text {l e a d i n g o r d e r}} {\approx} \mathcal {Q} \boldsymbol {w} := - \left(\frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} (\boldsymbol {w} ^ {\intercal} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) ^ {p - 1}\right) [ \operatorname {d i a g} \{\frac {\sigma^ {(p)} (\boldsymbol {0})}{(p - 1) !} \} (E ^ {[ k + 1: L ]} \boldsymbol {a}) ] _ {j} \\ + \left(\frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} (\boldsymbol {w} ^ {\intercal} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) ^ {p - 1}\right) [ \operatorname {d i a g} \{\frac {\sigma^ {(p)} (\mathbf {0})}{(p - 1) !} \} (E ^ {[ k + 1: L ]} \mathbf {a}) ] _ {j} \cdot \boldsymbol {u}) \boldsymbol {u}. \\ \end{array}
$$

WLOG, we also assume  $a \neq 0$ . And by definition,  $\boldsymbol{w} = r\boldsymbol{u}$ , we have

$$
\mathcal {Q} \boldsymbol {w} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \boldsymbol {u} = \frac {\frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} (\boldsymbol {u} ^ {\intercal} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) ^ {p - 1}}{\| \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} (\boldsymbol {u} ^ {\intercal} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) ^ {p - 1} \| _ {2}}
$$

$$
o r \quad \boldsymbol {u} = - \frac {\frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} (\boldsymbol {u} ^ {\intercal} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) ^ {p - 1}}{\| \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]} (\boldsymbol {u} ^ {\intercal} \boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) ^ {p - 1} \| _ {2}}.
$$

Since  $d + 1 = 2$ , we denote  $\mathbf{u} = (u_{1}, u_{2})^{\intercal} \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$  and  $\mathbf{x}_{i}^{[k - 1]} = ((\mathbf{x}_{i}^{[k - 1]})_{1}, (\mathbf{x}_{i}^{[k - 1]})_{2})^{\intercal} \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ , then,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} (u _ {1} (\boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {1} + u _ {2} (\boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {2}) ^ {p - 1} e _ {i} (\boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {1}}{\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} (u _ {1} (\boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {1} + u _ {2} (\boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {2}) ^ {p - 1} e _ {i} (\boldsymbol {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {\mathrm {2}}} = \frac {u _ {1}}{u _ {2}} \triangleq \hat {u}. \end{array}
$$

We obtain the equation for  $\hat{u}$

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} (\hat {u} (\pmb {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {1} + (\pmb {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {2}) ^ {p - 1} e _ {i} (\pmb {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {1} = \hat {u} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} (\hat {u} (\pmb {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {1} + (\pmb {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {2}) ^ {p - 1} e _ {i} (\pmb {x} _ {i} ^ {[ k - 1 ]}) _ {2}.
$$

Since it is an univariate  $p$ -th order equation,  $\hat{u} = \frac{u_1}{u_2}$  has at most  $p$  complex roots. Because  $\mathbf{u}$  is a unit vector,  $\mathbf{u}$  at most has  $p$  pairs of values, in which each pair are opposite.

Taken together, our theoretical analysis is consistent with our experiments, that is, the maximal number of condensed orientations is twice the multiplicity of the activation function used when parameters are small. In addition, because our commonly used activation functions, such as  $\tanh(x)$ , sigmoid(x), softplus(x), etc., are all multiplicity one, the theoretical analysis sheds light on practical training.

# 6 DISCUSSION

In this work, we have shown that the characteristic of the activation function, i.e., multiplicity, is a key factor to understanding the complexity of NN output and the weight condensation at initial training. The condensation restricts the NN to be effectively low-capacity at the initial training stage, even for finite-width NNs. During the training, the NN increases its capacity to better fit the data, leading to a potential explanation for their good generalization in practical problems. This work also serves as a starting point for further studying the condensation for multiple-layer neural networks throughout the training process.

How small the initialization should be in order to see a clear condensation is studied in Luo et al. (2021) for two-layer ReLU NNs with infinite width. For general activation functions, the regime of the initialization for condensation depends on the NN width. A further study of the phase diagram for finite width NNs would be important.

For general multiplicity with high-dimensional input data, the theoretical analysis for the initial condensation is a very difficult problem, which is equivalent to count the number of the roots of a high-order high-dimensional polynomial with a special structure originated from NNs.
