# DEEP DENOISING: RATE-OPTIMAL RECOVERY OF STRUCTURED SIGNALS WITH A DEEP PRIOR

Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review

# ABSTRACT

Deep neural networks provide state-of-the-art performance for image denoising, where the goal is to recover a near noise-free image from a noisy image. The underlying principle is that neural networks trained on large datasets have empirically been shown to be able to generate natural images well from a low-dimensional latent representation of the image. Given such a generator network, or prior, a noisy image can be denoised by finding the closest image in the range of the prior. However, there is little theory to justify this success, let alone to predict the denoising performance as a function of the networks parameters. In this paper we consider the problem of denoising an image from additive Gaussian noise, assuming the image is well described by a deep neural network with ReLu activations functions, mapping a  $k$ -dimensional latent space to an  $n$ -dimensional image. We state and analyze a simple gradient-descent-like iterative algorithm that minimizes a non-convex loss function, and provably removes a fraction of  $(1 - O(k / n))$  of the noise energy. We also demonstrate in numerical experiments that this denoising performance is, indeed, achieved by generative priors learned from data.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

We consider the image or signal denoising problem, where the goal is to remove noise from an unknown image or signal. In more detail, our goal is to obtain an estimate of an image or signal  $y_{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$  from

$$
y = y _ {*} + \eta ,
$$

where  $\eta$  is unknown noise, often modeled as a zero-mean white Gaussian random variable with covariance matrix  $\sigma^2 /nI$ .

Image denoising relies on modeling or prior assumptions on the image  $y_*$ . For example, suppose that the image  $y_*$  lies in a  $k$ -dimensional subspace of  $\mathbb{R}^n$  denoted by  $\mathcal{V}$ . Then we can estimate the original image by finding the closest point in  $\ell_2$ -distance to the noisy observation  $y$  on the subspace  $\mathcal{V}$ . The corresponding estimate, denoted by  $\hat{y}$ , obeys

$$
\left\| \hat {y} - y _ {*} \right\| ^ {2} \lesssim \sigma^ {2} \frac {k}{n}, \tag {1}
$$

with high probability (throughout,  $\| \cdot \|$  denotes the  $\ell_2$ -norm). Thus, the noise energy is reduced by a factor of  $k / n$  over the trivial estimate  $\hat{y} = y$  which does not use any prior knowledge of the signal. The denoising rate (1) shows that the more concise the image prior or image representation (i.e., the smaller  $k$ ), the more noise can be removed. If on the other hand the prior (the subspace, in this example) does not include the original image  $y_*$ , then the error bound (1) increases as we would remove a significant part of the signal along with noise when projecting onto the range of the signal prior. Thus a concise and accurate prior is crucial for denoising.

Real world signals rarely lie in a priori known subspaces, and the last few decades of image denoising research have developed sophisticated and accurate image models or priors and algorithms. Examples include models based on sparse representations in overcomplete dictionaries such as wavelets (Donoho, 1995) and curvelets (Starck et al., 2002), and algorithms based on exploiting

self-similarity within images (Dabov et al., 2007). A prominent example of the former class of algorithms is the BM3D (Dabov et al., 2007) algorithm, which achieves state-of-the-art performance for certain denoising problems. However, the nuances of real world images are difficult to describe with handcrafted models. Thus, starting with the paper (Elad & Aharon, 2006) that proposes to learn sparse representation based on training data, it has become common to learn concise representation for denoising (and other inverse problems) from a set of training images.

In 2012, Burger et al. (Burger et al., 2012) applied deep networks to the denoising problem, by training a deep network on a large set of images. Since then, deep learning based denoisers (Zhang et al., 2017) have set the standard for denoising. The success of deep network priors can be attributed to their ability to efficiently represent and learn realistic image priors, for example via auto-decoders (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006) and generative adversarial models (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Over the last few years, the quality of deep priors has significantly improved (Karras et al., 2017; Ulyanov et al., 2017). As this field matures, priors will be developed with even smaller latent code dimensionality and more accurate approximation of natural signal manifolds. Consequently, the representation error from deep priors will decrease, and thereby enable even more powerful denoisers.

While deep networks can model complex priors through many parameters and non-linearities, those non-linearities also make their analysis inherently difficult, increasing the gap between theory and practice. As a consequence, there is a need for theory explaining the success of deep network based priors.

Contributions: The goal of this paper is to analytically quantify the denoising performance of deep-prior based denoisers. Specifically, we characterize the denoising performance of a simple and efficient algorithm for denoising based on a  $d$ -layer generative neural network  $G \colon \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n$ , with  $k < n$ , and random weights. In more detail, we propose a gradient method with a tweak that attempts to minimize the least-squares loss  $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\| G(x) - y\|$  between the noisy image  $y$  and an image in the range of the prior,  $G(x)$ . Albeit  $f$  is non-convex, we show that the gradient method with a tweak yields an estimate  $\hat{x}$  obeying

$$
\left\| G (\hat {x}) - y _ {*} \right\| ^ {2} \lesssim \sigma^ {2} \frac {k}{n},
$$

with high probability, where the notation  $\lesssim$  absorbs a constant factor depending on the number of layers of the network, and its expansivity, discussed in more detail later. Our result shows that the denoising rate of a deep prior based denoiser is determined by the dimension of the latent representation.

We also show in numerical experiments, that this rate—shown to be analytically achieved for random priors—is also experimentally achieved for priors learned from real imaging data.

# 2 PROBLEM FORMULATION

We consider the problem of estimating a vector  $y_* \in \mathbb{R}^n$  from a noisy observation  $y = y_* + \eta$ . We assume that the vector  $y_*$  belongs to the range of a  $d$ -layer generative neural network  $G \colon \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n$ , with  $k < n$ . That is,  $y_* = G(x_*)$  for some  $x_* \in \mathbb{R}^k$ . We consider a generative network of the form

$$
G (x) = \operatorname {r e l u} \left(W _ {d} \dots \operatorname {r e l u} \left(W _ {2} \operatorname {r e l u} \left(W _ {1} x _ {*}\right)\right) \dots\right),
$$

where  $\mathrm{relu}(x) = \max (x,0)$  applies entrywise,  $W_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{n_{i}\times n_{i - 1}}$ , are the weights in the  $i$ -th layer,  $n_i$  is the number of neurons in the  $i$ th layer, and the network is expansive in the sense that  $k = n_0 < n_1 < \dots < n_d = n$ . The problem at hand is: Given the weights of the network  $W_{1}\ldots W_{d}$  and a noisy observation  $y$ , obtain an estimate  $\hat{y}$  of the original image  $y_*$  such that  $\| \hat{y} - y_*\|$  is small and  $\hat{y}$  is in the range of  $G$ .

# 3 DENOISING VIA EMPIRICAL RISK MINIMIZATION

As a way to solve the above problem, we first obtain an estimate of  $x_{*}$ , denoted by  $\hat{x}$ , and then estimate  $y_{*}$  as  $G(\hat{x})$ . In order to estimate  $x_{*}$ , we minimize the empirical risk objective

$$
f (x) := \frac {1}{2} \| G (x) - y \| ^ {2}.
$$

Figure 1: Loss surface  $f(x) = \| G(x) - G(x_{*})\|$ ,  $x_{*} = [1,0]$ , of an expansive network  $G$  with ReLu activation functions with  $k = 2$  nodes in the input layer and  $n_2 = 300$  and  $n_3 = 784$  nodes in the hidden and output layers, respectively, with random Gaussian weights in each layer. The surface has a critical point near  $-x_{*}$ , a global minimum at  $x_{*}$ , and a local maximum at 0.

Since this objective is nonconvex, there is no a priori guarantee of efficiently finding the global minimum. Approaches such as gradient methods could in principle get stuck in local minima, instead of finding a global minimizer that is close to  $x_{*}$ .

However, as we show in this paper, under appropriate conditions, a gradient method with a tweak—introduced next—finds a point that is very close to the original latent parameter  $x_{*}$ , with the distance to the parameter  $x_{*}$  controlled by the noise. In order to state the algorithm, we first introduce a useful quantity. For analyzing which rows of a matrix  $W$  are active when computing  $\mathrm{relu}(Wx)$ , we let

$$
W _ {+, x} = \operatorname {d i a g} (W x > 0) W.
$$

For a fixed weight matrix  $W$ , the matrix  $W_{+,x}$  zeros out the rows of  $W$  that do not have a positive dot product with  $x$ . Alternatively put,  $W_{+,x}$  contains weights from only the neurons that are active for the input  $x$ . We also define  $W_{1, +, x} = (W_1)_{+, x} = \mathrm{diag}(W_1 x > 0) W_1$  and

$$
W _ {i, +, x} = \operatorname {d i a g} \left(W _ {i} W _ {i - 1, +, x} \dots W _ {2, +, x} W _ {1, +, x} x > 0\right) W _ {i}.
$$

The matrix  $W_{i, + ,x}$  consists only of the weights of the neurons in the  $i$ th layer that are active if the input to the first layer is  $x$ .

We are now ready to state our algorithm: a gradient method with a tweak informed by the loss surface of the function to be minimized. Given a noisy observation  $y$ , the algorithm starts with an arbitrary initial point  $x_0 \neq 0$ . At each iteration  $i = 0,1,\ldots$ , the algorithm computes the step direction

$$
\tilde {v} _ {x _ {i}} = \left(\Pi_ {i = d} ^ {1} W _ {i, +, x _ {i}}\right) ^ {t} (G (x _ {i}) - y),
$$

which is equal to the gradient of  $f$  if  $f$  is differentiable at  $x_{i}$ . It then takes a small step opposite to  $\tilde{v}_{x_i}$ . The tweak is that before each iteration, the algorithm checks whether  $f(-x_{i})$  is smaller than  $f(x_{i})$ , and if so, negates the sign of the current iterate  $x_{i}$ .

This tweak is informed by the loss surface. To understand this step, it is instructive to examine the loss surface for the noiseless case in Figure 1. It can be seen that while the loss function has a global minimum at  $x_{*}$ , it is relatively flat close to  $-x_{*}$ . In expectation, there is a critical point that is a negative multiple of  $x_{*}$  with the property that the curvature in the  $\pm x_{*}$  direction is positive, and the curvature in the orthogonal directions is zero. Further, around approximately  $-x_{*}$ , the loss function is larger than around the optimum  $x_{*}$ . As a simple gradient descent method (without the tweak) could potentially get stuck in this region, the negation check provides a way to avoid converging to this region. Our algorithm is formally summarized as Algorithm 1 below.

Other variations of the tweak are also possible. For example, the negation check in Step 2 could be performed after a convergence criterion is satisfied, and if a lower objective is achieved by negating the latent code, then the gradient descent can be continued again until a convergence criterion is again satisfied.

# 4 MAIN RESULTS

For our analysis, we consider a fully-connected generative network  $G \colon \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n$  with Gaussian weights and no bias terms. Specifically, we assume that the weights  $W_{i}$  are independently and identically distributed as  $\mathcal{N}(0,2 / n_i)$ , but do not require them to be independent across layers. Moreover, we assume that the network is sufficiently expansive:

Expansivity condition. We say that the expansivity condition with constant  $\epsilon > 0$  holds if

$$
n _ {i} \geqslant c \epsilon^ {- 2} \log (1 / \epsilon) n _ {i - 1} \log n _ {i - 1}, \quad f o r a l l i,
$$

where  $c$  is a particular numerical constant.

In a real-world generative network the weights are learned from training data, and are not drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Nonetheless, the motivation for selecting Gaussian weights for our analysis is as follows:

1. The empirical distribution of weights from deep neural networks often have statistics consistent with Gaussians. AlexNet is a concrete example (Arora et al., 2015).  
2. The field of theoretical analysis of recovery guarantees for deep learning is nascent, and Gaussian networks can permit theoretical results because of well developed theories for random matrices.

We are now ready to state our main result.

Theorem 1. Consider a network with the weights in the  $i$ -th layer,  $W_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{n_{i}\times n_{i - 1}}$ , i.i.d.  $\mathcal{N}(0,2 / n_i)$  distributed, and suppose that the network satisfies the expansivity condition for some  $\epsilon \leqslant K / d^{90}$ . Also, suppose that the noise variance obeys

$$
\omega \leqslant \frac {\| x _ {*} \| K _ {1}}{d ^ {1 6}}, \quad \omega := \sqrt {1 8 \sigma^ {2} \frac {k}{n} \log (n _ {1} ^ {d} n _ {2} ^ {d - 1} . . . n _ {d})}.
$$

Consider the iterates of Algorithm 1 with stepsize  $\alpha = K_4\frac{1}{d^2}$ . Then, there exists a number of steps  $N$  upper bounded by

$$
N \leqslant \frac {K _ {2}}{d ^ {4} \epsilon} \frac {f (x _ {0})}{\| x _ {*} \|}
$$

such that after  $N$  steps, the iterates of Algorithm 1 obey

$$
\left\| x _ {i} - x _ {*} \right\| \leqslant K _ {5} d ^ {9} \| x _ {*} \| \sqrt {\epsilon} + K _ {6} d ^ {6} \omega , \quad f o r a l l i \geqslant N, \tag {2}
$$

with probability at least  $1 - 2e^{-2k\log n} - \sum_{i=2}^{d} 8n_i e^{-K_7n_{i-2}} - 8n_1 e^{-K_7\epsilon^2 \log(1/\epsilon)k}$ . Here,  $K_1, K_2, \ldots$  are numerical constants, and  $x_0$  is the initial point in the optimization.

The error term in the bound (2) consists of two terms—the first is controlled by  $\epsilon$ , and the second depends on the noise. The first term is negligible if  $\epsilon$  is chosen sufficiently small, but that comes at the expense of the expansivity condition being more stringent. The second term in the bound (2) is more interesting and controls the effect of noise. Specifically, for  $\epsilon$  sufficiently small, our result guarantees that after sufficiently many iterations,

$$
\left\| x _ {i} - x _ {*} \right\| ^ {2} \lesssim \sigma^ {2} \frac {k}{n},
$$

where the notation  $\lesssim$  absorbs a factor logarithmic in  $n$  and polynomial in  $d$ . One can show that  $G$  is Lipschitz in a region around  $x_{*}^{1}$ ,

$$
\left\| G (x _ {i}) - G (x _ {*}) \right\| ^ {2} \lesssim \sigma^ {2} \frac {k}{n}.
$$

Thus, the theorem guarantees that our algorithm yields the denoising rate of  $\sigma^2 k / n$ , and, as a consequence, denoising based on a generative deep prior provably reduces the energy of the noise in the original image by a factor of  $k / n$ . We note that the intention of this paper is to show rate-optimality of recovery with respect to the noise power, the latent code dimensionality, and the signal dimensionality. As a result, no attempt was made to establish optimal bounds with respect to the scaling of constants or to powers of  $d$ . The bounds provided in the theorem are highly conservative in the constants and dependency on the number of layers,  $d$ , in order to keep the proof as simple as possible. Numerical experiments shown later reveal that the parameter range for successful denoising are much broader than the constants suggest. As this result is the first of its kind for rigorous analysis of denoising performance by deep generative networks, we anticipate the results can be improved in future research, as has happened for other problems, such as sparsity-based compressed sensing and phase retrieval.

# 4.1 THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION CONDITION (WDC)

To prove our main result, we make use of a deterministic condition on  $G$ , called the Weight Distribution Condition (WDC), and then show that Gaussian  $W_{i}$ , as given by the statement of Theorem 1 are such that  $W_{i} / \sqrt{2}$  satisfies the WDC with the appropriate probability for all  $i$ , provided the expansivity condition holds. Our main result, Theorem 1, continues to hold for any weight matrices such that  $W_{i} / \sqrt{2}$  satisfy the WDC.

The condition is on the spatial arrangement of the network weights within each layer. We say that the matrix  $W \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$  satisfies the Weight Distribution Condition with constant  $\epsilon$  if for all nonzero  $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^k$ ,

$$
\left\| \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} 1 _ {\langle w _ {i}, x \rangle > 0} 1 _ {\langle w _ {i}, y \rangle > 0} \cdot w _ {i} w _ {i} ^ {t} - Q _ {x, y} \right\| \leqslant \epsilon , \text {w i t h} Q _ {x, y} = \frac {\pi - \theta_ {0}}{2 \pi} I _ {k} + \frac {\sin \theta_ {0}}{2 \pi} M _ {\hat {x} \leftrightarrow \hat {y}}, \tag {3}
$$

where  $w_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{k}$  is the  $i$ th row of  $W$ ;  $M_{\hat{x}\leftrightarrow \hat{y}}\in \mathbb{R}^{k\times k}$  is the matrix such that  $\hat{x}\mapsto \hat{y}$ ,  $\hat{y}\mapsto \hat{x}$ , and  $z\mapsto 0$  for all  $z\in \mathrm{span}(\{x,y\})^{\perp}$ ;  $\hat{x} = x / \| x\| _2$  and  $\hat{y} = y / \| y\| _2$ ;  $\theta_0 = \angle (x,y)$ ; and  $1_{S}$  is the indicator function on  $S$ . The norm in the left hand side of (3) is the spectral norm. Note that an elementary calculation gives that  $Q_{x,y} = \mathbb{E}\big[\sum_{i = 1}^{n}1_{\langle w_i,x\rangle >0}1_{\langle w_i,y\rangle >0}\cdot w_iw_i^t\big]$  for  $w_{i}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I_{k} / n)$ . As the rows  $w_{i}$  correspond to the neural network weights of the  $i$ th neuron in a layer given by  $W$ , the WDC provides a deterministic property under which the set of neuron weights within the layer given by  $W$  are distributed approximately like a Gaussian. The WDC could also be interpreted as a deterministic property under which the neuron weights are distributed approximately like a uniform random variable on a sphere of a particular radius. Note that if  $x = y$ ,  $Q_{x,y}$  is an isometry up to a factor of  $1 / 2$ .

# 5 APPLICATIONS TO COMPRESSED SENSING

In this section we briefly discuss another important scenario to which our results apply to, namely regularizing inverse problems using deep generative priors. Approaches that regularize inverse problems using deep generative models (Bora et al., 2017) have empirically been shown to improve over sparsity-based approaches, see (Lucas et al., 2018) for a review for applications in imaging,

and (Mardani et al., 2017) for an application in Magnetic Resonance Imaging showing a significant performance improvement over conventional methods.

Consider an inverse problem, where the goal is to reconstruct an unknown vector  $y_{*} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$  from  $m < n$  noisy linear measurements:

$$
z = A y _ {*} + \eta \quad \in \mathbb {R} ^ {m},
$$

where  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$  is called the measurement matrix and  $\eta$  is zero mean Gaussian noise with covariance matrix  $\sigma^2 / nI$ , as before. As before, assume that  $y_*$  lies in the range of a generative prior  $G$ , i.e.,  $y_* = G(x_*)$  for some  $x_*$ . As a way to recover  $x_*$ , consider minimizing the empirical risk objective  $f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \| AG(x) - z \|$ , using Algorithm 1, with Step 6 substituted by  $\tilde{v}_{x_i} = (A\Pi_{i=d}^1 W_{i,+,x_i})^t (AG(x_i) - y)$ , to account for the fact that measurements were taken with the matrix  $A$ .

Suppose that  $A$  is a random projection matrix, for concreteness assume that  $A$  has i.i.d. Gaussian entries with variance  $1 / m$ . One could prove an analogous result as Theorem 1, but with  $\omega = \sqrt{18\sigma^2\frac{k}{m}\log(n_1^d n_2^{d - 1}\ldots n_d)}$ , (note that  $n$  has been replaced by  $m$ ). This extension shows that, provided  $\epsilon$  is chosen sufficiently small, that our algorithm yields an iterate  $x_{i}$  obeying

$$
\left\| G (x _ {i}) - G (x _ {*}) \right\| ^ {2} \lesssim \sigma^ {2} \frac {k}{m},
$$

where again  $\lesssim$  absorbs factors logarithmic in the  $n_i$ 's, and polynomial in  $d$ . Proving this result would be analogous to the proof of Theorem 1, but with the additional assumption that the sensing matrix  $A$  acts like an isometry on the union of the ranges of  $\Pi_{i=d}^{1}W_{i,+,x_i}$ , analogous to the proof in (Hand & Voroninski, 2018). This extension of our result shows that Algorithm 1 enables solving inverse problems under noise efficiently, and quantifies the effect of the noise.

We hasten to add that the paper (Bora et al., 2017) also derived an error bound for minimizing empirical loss. However, the corresponding result (for example Lemma 4.3) differs in two important aspects to our result. First, the result in (Bora et al., 2017) only makes a statement about the minimizer of the empirical loss and does not provide justification that an algorithm can efficiently find a point near the global minimizer. As the program is non-convex, and as non-convex optimization is NP-hard in general, the empirical loss could have local minima at which algorithms get stuck. In contrast, the present paper presents a specific practical algorithm and proves that it finds a solution near the global optimizer regardless of initialization. Second, the result in (Bora et al., 2017) considers arbitrary noise  $\eta$  and thus can not assert denoising performance. In contrast, we consider a random model for the noise, and show the denoising behavior that the resulting error is no more than  $O(k / n)$ , as opposed to  $\| \eta \| ^2\approx O(1)$ , which is what we would get from direct application of the result in (Bora et al., 2017).

# 6 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section we provide experimental evidence that corroborates our theoretical claims that denoising with deep priors achieves a denoising rate proportional to  $\sigma^2 k / n$ . We consider both a synthetic, random prior, as studied theoretically in the paper, as well as a prior learned from data. All our results are reproducible with the code provided in the supplement.

# 6.1 DENOISING WITH A SYNTHETIC PRIOR

We start with a synthetic generative network prior with ReLu-activation functions, and draw its weights independently from a Gaussian distribution. We consider a two-layer network with  $n = 1500$  neurons in the output layer, 500 in the middle layer, and vary the number of input neurons,  $k$ , and the noise level,  $\sigma$ . We next present simulations showing that if  $k$  is sufficiently small, our algorithm achieves a denoising rate proportional to  $\sigma k / n$  as guaranteed by our theory.

Towards this goal, we generate Gaussian inputs  $x_{*}$  to the network and observe the noisy image  $y = G(x_{*}) + \eta$ ,  $\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 /nI)$ . From the noisy image, we first obtain an estimate  $\hat{x}$  of the latent representation by running Algorithm 1 until convergence, and second we obtain an estimate of the image as  $\hat{y} = G(\hat{x})$ . In the left and middle panel of Figure 3, we depict the normalized mean

![](images/45f5679129cd865f228f16d5ae0b00fbfeb8f0a1a2820a37afbbc55796b6dc64.jpg)

squared error of the latent representation,  $\mathrm{MSE}(\hat{x},x_{*})$ , and the mean squared error in the image domain,  $\mathrm{MSE}(G(\hat{x}),G(x_{*}))$ , where we defined  $\mathrm{MSE}(z,z^{\prime}) = \| z - z^{\prime}\|^{2}$ . For the left panel, we fix the noise variance to  $\sigma^2 = 0.25$ , and vary  $k$ , and for the middle panel we fix  $k = 50$  and vary the noise variance. The results show that, if the network is sufficiently expansive, guaranteed by  $k$  being sufficiently small, then in the noiseless case ( $\sigma^2 = 0$ ), the latent representation and image are perfectly recovered. In the noisy case, we achieve a MSE proportional to  $\sigma^2 k / n$ , both in the representation and image domains.

We also observed that for the problem instances considered here, the negation trick in step 3-4 of Algorithm 1 is often not necessary, in that even without that step the algorithm typically converges to the global minimum. Having said this, in general the negation step is necessary, since there exist problem instances that have a local minimum opposite of  $x_{*}$ .

# 6.2 DENOISING WITH A LEARNED PRIOR

We next consider a prior learned from data. Technically, for such a prior our theory does not apply since we assume the weights to be chosen at random. However, the numerical results presented in this section show that even for the learned prior we achieve the rate predicted by our theory pertaining to a random prior. Towards this goal, we consider a fully-connected autoencoder parameterized by  $k$ , consisting of an decoder and encoder with ReLu activation functions and fully connected layers. We choose the number of neurons in the three layers of the encoder as 784, 400,  $k$ , and those of the decoder as  $k$ , 400, 784. We set  $k = 10$  and  $k = 20$  to obtain two different autoencoders. We train both autoencoders on the MNIST (Lecun et al., 1998) training set.

We then take an image  $y_*$  from the MNIST test set, add Gaussian noise to it, and denoise it using our method based on the learned decoder-network  $G$  for  $k = 10$  and  $k = 20$ . Specifically, we estimate the latent representation  $\hat{x}$  by running Algorithm 1, and then set  $\hat{y} = G(\hat{x})$ . See Figure 2 for a few examples demonstrating the performance of our approach for different noise levels.

We next show that this achieves a mean squared error (MSE) proportional to  $\sigma^2 k / n$ , as suggested by our theory which applies for decoders with random weights. We add noise to the images with noise variance ranging from  $\sigma^2 = 0$  to  $\sigma^2 = 6$ . In the right panel of Figure 3 we show the MSE in the image domain,  $\mathrm{MSE}(G(\hat{x}), G(x_{*}))$ , averaged over a number of images for the learned decoders with  $k = 10$  and  $k = 20$ . We observe an interesting tradeoff: The decoder with  $k = 10$  has fewer parameters, and thus does not represent the digits as well, therefore the MSE is larger than that for  $k = 20$  for the noiseless case (i.e., for  $\sigma = 0$ ). On the other hand, the smaller number of parameters results in a better denoising rate (by about a factor of two), corresponding to the steeper slope of the MSE as a function of the noise variance,  $\sigma^2$ .

Figure 3: Mean square error in the image domain,  $\mathrm{MSE}(G(\hat{x}),x_{*})$ , and in the latent representation,  $\mathrm{MSE}(\hat{x},x_{*})$ , as a function of the dimension of the latent representation,  $k$ , with  $\sigma^2 = 0.25$  (left panel), and the noise variance,  $\sigma^2$  with  $k = 50$  (middle panel). As suggested by the theory pertaining to decoders with random weights, if  $k$  is sufficiently small, and thus the network is sufficiently expansive, the denoising rate is proportional to  $\sigma^2 k / n$ . Right panel: Denoising of handwritten digits based on a learned decoder with  $k = 10$  and  $k = 20$ , along with the least-squares fit as dotted lines. The learned decoder with  $k = 20$  has more parameters and thus represents the images with a smaller error; therefore the MSE at  $\sigma = 0$  is smaller. However, the denoising rate for the decoder with  $k = 20$ , which is the slope of the curve is larger as well, as suggested by our theory.
