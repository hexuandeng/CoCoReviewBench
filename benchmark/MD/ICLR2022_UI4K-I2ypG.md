Paper under double-blind review

# ABSTRACT

Popular approaches for quantifying predictive uncertainty in deep neural networks often involve a set of weights or models, for instance via ensembling or Monte Carlo Dropout. These techniques usually produce overhead by having to train multiple model instances or do not produce very diverse predictions. This survey aims to familiarize the reader with an alternative class of models based on the concept of Evidential Deep Learning: For unfamiliar data, they admit "what they don't know" and fall back onto a prior belief. Furthermore, they allow uncertainty estimation in a single model and forward pass by parameterizing (distributions over distributions). This survey recapitulates existing works, focusing on the implementation in a classification setting. Finally, we survey the application of the same paradigm to regression problems. We also provide a reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of the mentioned approaches compared to existing ones and provide the most central theoretical results in order to inform future research.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Many existing methods for uncertainty estimation leverage the concept of Bayesian Model Averaging, that approaches such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), Bayes-by-backprop (Blundell et al., 2015) or ensembling (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) can be grouped under (Wilson & Izmailov, 2020). This involves the approximation of an otherwise infeasible to compute integral using Monte Carlo samples - for instance from an auxiliary distribution or in the form of ensemble members. This implies the following problems: Firstly, the qual

ity of the MC approximation depends on the veracity and diversity of samples from the weight posterior. Secondly, the approach often involves increasing the number of parameters in a model or training more model instances altogether. Recently, a new class of models has been proposed to side-step this conundrum by using a different factorization of the posterior predictive distribution. This allows to compute uncertainty in a single forward pass and set of weights. Furthermore, these models are grounded in a concept coined *Evidential Deep Learning*: For out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, they fall back onto a prior, often expressed as knowing what they don't know.

Our contributions are as follows: We summarize the existing literature and group these approaches, critically reflecting on their advantages and shortcomings alike, as well as how they fare compared to other methods. This survey aims to both serve as an accessible introduction to this model family to the unfamiliar reader as well as an informative overview, in order to promote more applications outside the uncertainty estimation literature. We also to provide a collection of the most important theoretical results for the Dirichlet distribution for Machine Learning, which plays a central role in many of the discussed approaches. We give an overview over all discussed work in fig. 1.

We first familiarize the reader with the necessary prerequisites for the rest of the survey, including Bayesian Model Averaging and the alternative approach of Evidential Deep Learning in §2.2 along with a short introduction to the Dirichlet distribution in the next section.

# 2.1 THE DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION

The Beta distribution is a commonly used prior for a Bernoulli likelihood, which can be used to formulate a binary classification problem. The Dirichlet distribution arises as a multivariate generalization of the Beta distribution for a multi-class classification problem and is defined as follows:

$$
\operatorname {D i r} (\boldsymbol {\mu}; \boldsymbol {\alpha}) = \frac {1}{B (\boldsymbol {\alpha})} \prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \mu_ {k} ^ {\alpha_ {k} - 1}; \quad B (\boldsymbol {\alpha}) = \frac {\prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \Gamma (\alpha_ {k})}{\Gamma (\alpha_ {0})}; \quad \alpha_ {0} = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \alpha_ {k}; \quad \alpha_ {k} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {+} \tag {1}
$$

where  $\Gamma(\cdot)$  denotes the gamma function, a generalization of the factorial to the real numbers,  $K$  the number of categories or classes and  $B(\cdot)$  is called the beta function. For notational convenience, we also define  $\mathbb{K} = \{1,\dots ,K\}$  as the set of all classes. The distribution is characterized by its concentration parameters  $\alpha$ , the sum of which, often denoted as  $\alpha_0$ , is called the precision. The distribution becomes relevant for applications using neural networks, considering that most modern networks for classification use a softmax function after their last layer to produce a categorical distribution of classes, for which the Dirichlet is a conjugate prior. The class probabilities can be expressed using a vector  $\mu \in [0,1]^K$  s.t.  $\mu_k \equiv P(y = k|x)$ . Then, using a Dirichlet prior for a categorical likelihood, due to its conjugacy, produces a Dirichlet posterior with parameters  $\beta$ , given a dataset  $\mathbb{D} = \{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$  of  $N$  observations with corresponding labels:

$$
\begin{array}{l} p (\boldsymbol {\alpha} \mid \mathbb {D}, \boldsymbol {\mu}) \propto p (\mathbb {D} | \boldsymbol {\mu}) p (\boldsymbol {\mu} \mid \boldsymbol {\alpha}) = \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \mu_ {k} ^ {\mathbf {1} _ {y _ {i} = k}} \frac {1}{B (\boldsymbol {\alpha})} \prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \mu_ {k} ^ {\alpha_ {k} - 1} \\ = \prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \mu_ {k} ^ {\left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \mathbf {1} _ {y _ {i} = k}\right)} \frac {1}{B (\boldsymbol {\alpha})} \prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \mu_ {k} ^ {\alpha_ {k} - 1} = \frac {1}{B (\boldsymbol {\alpha})} \prod_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \mu_ {k} ^ {N _ {k} + \alpha_ {k} - 1} = \operatorname {D i r} (\boldsymbol {\mu}; \boldsymbol {\beta}) \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\beta$  is a vector with  $\beta_{k} = \alpha_{k} + N_{k}$ , with  $N_{k}$  denoting the number of observations for class  $k$  and 1 being the indicator function. Intuitively, this implies that the prior belief encoded by the initial Dirichlet is updated using the actual data, sharpening the distribution for classes for which many instances have been observed. This distribution constitutes a distribution over categorical distributions over the  $K - 1$  probability simplex, multiple instances of which are shown in fig. 2. Each point on the simplex corresponds to a categorical distribution, with the proximity to a corner indicating a high probability for the corresponding class. Fig. 2a displays the predictions of an ensemble of classifiers as a point cloud on the simplex. Using a Dirichlet, this finite set of distributions can be extended to a continuous density over the whole simplex (fig. figs. 2b to 2f).

# 2.2 PREDICTIVE UNCERTAINTY IN NEURAL NETWORKS

In probabilistic modelling, uncertainty is commonly divided into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty (Der Kiureghian & Ditlevsen, 2009; Hultermeier & Waegeman, 2021). The former refers to the uncertainty that is induced by the data-generating process, and which e.g. might create an unresolvable overlap in class distributions. The latter describes the uncertainty about the optimal model parameters (or even hypothesis class), reducible with an increasing amount of data as less and less possible models become a plausible fit. These two notions resurface when formulating the posterior predictive distribution of a classifier for a new data point  $\mathbf{x}^{\prime}$ :

$$
p (y \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\prime}) = \int \underbrace {P (y \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\prime} , \boldsymbol {\theta})} _ {\text {A l e a t o r i c}} \underbrace {p (\boldsymbol {\theta} \mid \mathbb {D})} _ {\text {E p i s t e m i c}} d \boldsymbol {\theta} \tag {3}
$$

For a large number of real-valued parameters  $\theta$  like in neural networks, this integral becomes intractable to evaluate, and thus is usually approximated using Monte Carlo samples – with the aforementioned problems of potential computational overhead and approximation errors. Malinin & Gales (2018) thus propose to factorize eq. 3 further:

$$
p (y \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\prime}) = \iint_ {\text {A l e a t o r i c}} \underbrace {P (y \mid \boldsymbol {\mu})} _ {\text {D i s t r i b u t i o n a l}} \underbrace {p (\boldsymbol {\mu} \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\prime} , \mathbb {D})} _ {\text {E p i s t e m i c}} \underbrace {p (\boldsymbol {\theta} \mid \mathbb {D})} d \boldsymbol {\mu} d \boldsymbol {\theta} = \int P (y \mid \boldsymbol {\mu}) \underbrace {p (\boldsymbol {\mu} \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\prime} , \hat {\boldsymbol {\theta}})} _ {p (\boldsymbol {\theta} \mid \mathbb {D}) = \delta (\boldsymbol {\theta} - \hat {\boldsymbol {\theta}})} d \boldsymbol {\mu} \tag {4}
$$

In the last step, we replace  $p(\theta \mid \mathbb{D})$  by a point estimate  $\hat{\theta}$  using the dirac delta function, i.e. a single trained neural network, to get rid of the intractable integral. Although another integral remains, retrieving the uncertainty from this predictive distribution actually has a closed-form analytical solution for the Dirichlet (see §3.2). The advantage of this approach is further that it allows us to differentiate uncertainty about a data point because it lies in a region of considerable class overlap (fig. 2c) from it differing from the training distribution entirely (fig. 2e).

# 3 DIRICHLET NETWORKS

We will now show in sec. 3.1 elaborate on how neural networks can parameterize Dirichlet distributions, while sec. 3.2 reveals how such parameterization can be exploited for efficient uncertainty estimation. The remaining sections then enumerate different examples from the literature parameterizing either a prior (§3.3.1) or posterior Dirichlet distribution (§3.3.2) according to eq. 1. An overview over all reviewed methods highlighting some of their core differences is given in table 1.

# 3.1 PARAMETERIZATION

For a classification problem with  $K$  classes, a neural classifier is usually realized as a function  $f_{\pmb{\theta}}: \mathbb{R}^{D} \to \mathbb{R}^{K}$ , mapping to logits for each class given an input  $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ . Followed up by a softmax function, this then defines a categorical distribution over classes with a vector  $\pmb{\mu}$  s.t.  $\mu_{k} \equiv p(y = k | \mathbf{x}, \pmb{\theta})$ . The same architecture can be used without any major modification to instead parameterize a Dirichlet distribution, as in eq. 1. In order to classify a data point  $\mathbf{x}$ , a categorical distribution is

created from the predicted concentration parameters of the Dirichlet as follows (this definition arises from the expected value, see appendix A.1):

$$
\boldsymbol {\alpha} = f _ {\boldsymbol {\theta}} (\mathbf {x}); \quad \mu_ {k} = \frac {\alpha_ {k}}{\alpha_ {0}}; \quad \hat {y} = \underset {k \in \mathbb {K}} {\arg \max } \mu_ {0}, \dots , \mu_ {K} \tag {5}
$$

As discussed in section 3.3.2, this process is very similar when parameterizing a Dirichlet posterior distribution, except that in this case, a term corresponding to the class observation in eq. 2 is added to every concentration parameter as well.

# 3.2 UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION WITH DIRICHLET NETWORKS

Let us now turn our attention on how to estimate the different notions of uncertainty laid out in section 2.2 within the Dirichlet framework. Although stated for the prior parameters  $\alpha$ , the following methods can also be applied to the posterior Dirichlet parameters  $\beta$  as well without loss of generality.

Data (aleatoric) uncertainty. For the data uncertainty, we can evaluate the expected entropy of the data distribution  $p(y|\mu)$  (similar to previous works like e.g. Gal & Ghahramani, 2016). As the entropy captures the "peakiness" of the output distribution, a lower entropy indicates that the model is concentrating all probability mass on a single class, while high entropy stands for a more uniform distribution – the model thus is undecided about the right prediction. For Dirichlet networks, this quantity has a closed-form solution (for the full derivation, refer to Appendix B.1):

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {p (\boldsymbol {\mu} \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\prime}, \hat {\boldsymbol {\theta}})} \left[ H \left[ P (y \mid \boldsymbol {\mu}) \right] \right] = - \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \frac {\alpha_ {k}}{\alpha_ {0}} \left(\psi \left(\alpha_ {k} + 1\right) - \psi \left(\alpha_ {0} + 1\right)\right) \tag {6}
$$

where  $\psi$  denotes the digamma function, defined as  $\psi (x) = \frac{d}{dx}\log \Gamma (x)$ , and  $H$  the Shannon entropy.

Model (epistemic) uncertainty. As we saw in section 2.2, computing the model uncertainty in the classical sense via the weight posterior  $p(\theta \mid \mathbb{D})$  like in Blundell et al. (2015); Gal & Ghahramani (2016); Smith & Gal (2018) is not possible in the Dirichlet framework. Nevertheless, the defining property of Dirichlet networks is that epistemic uncertainty is expressed in the spread of the Dirichlet distribution (for instance in fig. 2 (d) and (e)). Therefore, the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified considering the concentration parameters  $\alpha$  that shape this very same distribution: Charpentier et al. (2020) simply consider the maximum  $\alpha_{k}$  as a score akin to the maximum probability score by Hendrycks & Gimpel (2017), while Sensoy et al. (2018) compute it by  $K / \sum_{k=1}^{K} (\alpha_{k} + 1)$  or simply  $\alpha_{0}$  (Charpentier et al., 2020). In both cases, the underlying intuition is that larger  $\alpha_{k}$  produce a sharper density, and thus indicate increased confidence in a prediction.

Distributional uncertainty. Another appealing property of this model family is to distinguish uncertainty due to model underspecification (fig. 2d) from uncertainty due to alien inputs (fig. 2e). In the Dirichlet framework, the distributional uncertainty can be deduced by computing the difference between the total amount of uncertainty and the data uncertainty, which can be expressed in terms of the mutual information between the label  $y$  and its distribution  $\mu$ :

$$
I \left[ y, \boldsymbol {\mu} \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\prime}, \mathbb {D} \right] = \underbrace {H \left[ \mathbb {E} _ {p \left(\boldsymbol {\mu} \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\prime} , \mathbb {D}\right)} \left[ P (y \mid \boldsymbol {\mu}) \right] \right]} _ {\text {T o t a l U n c e r t a i n t y}} - \underbrace {\mathbb {E} _ {p \left(\boldsymbol {\mu} \mid \mathbf {x} ^ {\prime} , \mathbb {D}\right)} \left[ H \left[ P (y \mid \boldsymbol {\mu}) \right] \right]} _ {\text {D a t a U n c e r t a i n t y}} \tag {7}
$$

Given that  $\mathbb{E}[\mu_k] = \frac{\alpha_k}{\alpha_0}$  (appendix A.1) and assuming the point estimate  $p(\boldsymbol{\mu}|\mathbf{x}',\mathbb{D})\approx p(\boldsymbol{\mu}|\mathbf{x}',\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})$  to be sufficient (Malinin & Gales, 2018), we obtain an expression very similar to eq. 6.

$$
= - \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \frac {\alpha_ {k}}{\alpha_ {0}} \left(\log \frac {\alpha_ {k}}{\alpha_ {0}} - \psi (\alpha_ {k} + 1) + \psi (\alpha_ {0} + 1)\right)
$$

# 3.3 EXISTING APPROACHES

The properties we discussed in previous sections are desirable traits, as they simplify the process of obtaining different uncertainty scores. However, it is important to note that the behaviors of the Dirichlet distributions in fig. 2 are idealized. In the empirical risk minimization framework that neural networks are usually trained in, Dirichlet networks are not incentivized to behave in the depicted way per se. Thus, when comparing existing approaches for parameterizing Dirichlet priors (§3.3.1) and posteriors (§3.3.2), we mainly focus on the different ways that authors try to tackle this problem by means of loss functions and training procedures. A general overview is provided in table 1, with direct comparison of all loss functions in appendix C.1.

# 3.3.1 PRIOR NETWORKS

The key challenge in training Dirichlet networks comes in the form of ensuring both high classification performance and the intended behavior under foreign data inputs. For this reason, most discussed works follow a loss function design using two parts: One optimizing for task accuracy for the former goal, the other one for a flat Dirichlet distribution for the latter. Due to spatial constraints, we refrain to present all the different ideas from table 1 in detail and instead only highlight some of them, summarizing the rest in an informal manner.<sup>7</sup>

Sensoy et al. (2018) train their prior network using a straightforward  $l_{2}$  loss between the predicted Dirichlet and the one-hot encoded class label (appendix B.4), as well as a regularization term consisting of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence w.r.t. a uniform, flat Dirichlet:

$$
\mathrm {K L} \big [ p (\pmb {\mu} | \pmb {\alpha}) \big | \big | p (\pmb {\mu} | \mathbf {1}) \big ] = - \log \frac {\Gamma (K)}{B (\pmb {\alpha})} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} (\alpha_ {k} - 1) (\psi (\alpha_ {k}) - \psi (\alpha_ {0}))
$$

Tsiligkaridis (2019) uses a similar approach by deriving a generalized  $l_{p}$  loss (see Appendix B.3), but using a local approximation of the Rényi divergence for the regularization term instead in order to ensure higher uncertainties for misclassified examples. Zhao et al. (2020) similarly use a  $l_{2}$  loss in the context of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), but adapt the KL regularization term to incorporate information about the local graph structure instead of referring to a uniform prior, as well as a knowledge distillation loss.

Instead of enforcing the flatness of the Dirichlet by itself, Malinin & Gales (2018) instead explicitly maximize the KL divergence to a uniform Dirichlet on OOD data points. Further, they instead utilize another KL term to train the model on predicting the correct label instead of a  $l_{p}$  norm. However, as the KL divergence is not symmetrical, Malinin & Gales (2019) argue that the reverse counterparts of both loss terms actually have more appealing properties in producing the correct behavior of the predicted distribution (see Appendix B.5). Nandy et al. (2020) refine this idea further, stating that even in this framework high epistemic and high distributional uncertainty (figs. 2d and 2e) might be confused, and instead propose novel loss functions producing a representation gap (fig. 2f; check appendix C.1 for the final form). Lastly, Malinin et al. (2020b) show that prior networks can also be distilled using an ensemble of classifiers and their predicted categorical distributions (akin to learning fig. 2e from fig. 2a), which does not require regularization at all (but training the ensemble).

An application to Natural Language Processing can be found in the work of Shen et al. (2020), who train their recurrent neural network for spoken language understanding using a simple cross-entropy loss and entropy regularizer. However, Biloš et al. (2019), who apply their model to asynchronous event classification, note that the standard cross-entropy loss only involves a point estimate of a

categorical distribution, discarding all the information contained in the predicted Dirichlet. For this reason, they propose an uncertainty-aware cross-entropy (UCE) loss instead, which has a closed-form solution in the Dirichlet case (see appendix B.6). They further regularize the mean and variance for OOD data points using an extra loss term.

# 3.3.2 POSTERIOR NETWORKS

As elaborated on in §2.1, choosing a Dirichlet prior, due to its conjugacy to the categorical distribution, induces a Dirichlet posterior distribution. Like the prior in the previous section, this posterior can be parameterized by a neural network. The challenges hereby are two-fold: Accounting for the number of class observations  $N_{k}$  that make up part of the posterior density parameters  $\beta$  (eq. 2), and, similarly to prior networks, ensuring the wanted behavior on the probability simplex for in- and out-of-distribution inputs. Charpentier et al. (2020) solve the former problem by setting  $\alpha$  to a uniform prior, and using class observations  $N_{k}$  as well as the probability of an input's latent representation  $\mathbf{z}$  under a normalizing flow<sup>10</sup> (NF; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) with parameters  $\phi$  and one flow instance per class (see fig. 3):

$$
\beta_ {k} = \alpha_ {k} + N _ {k} \cdot p (\mathbf {z} | y = k, \phi); \quad \mathbf {z} = f _ {\theta} (\mathbf {x})
$$

This has the advantage of producing low probabilities for strange inputs like the noise in fig. 3, which in turn translate to low concentration parameters of the posterior Dirichlet, as it falls back onto the uniform prior. The model is then optimized using the same uncertaint- aware cross-entropy loss as in Biloš et al. (2019) with an additional entropy regularizer.

Another route lies in directly parameterizing the posterior parameters  $\beta$ . Because it is infeasible to model the posterior this way due to an intractable integral, this leaves us to instead model an approximate posterior using variational inference methods, which is exactly the approach of Joo et al. (2020) and Chen et al. (2018). As the KL divergence between the true and approximate posterior is infeasible to estimate as well, the variational methods usually optimizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) instead. For the Dirichlet family, the ELBO has

an analytical solution (we refer the reader to Appendix A.3 for a derivation of the expression):

$$
\mathcal {L} _ {\mathrm {E L B O}} = \psi (\beta_ {y}) - \psi (\beta_ {0}) - \log \frac {B (\boldsymbol {\beta})}{B (\boldsymbol {\gamma})} + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} (\beta_ {k} - \gamma_ {k}) \left(\psi (\beta_ {k}) - \psi (\beta_ {0})\right)
$$

# 4 EVIDENTIAL DEEP LEARNING FOR REGRESSION

Because the Evidential Deep Learning framework provides such appealing properties, the question naturally arises of whether it can be extended to regression problems as well. The answer is yes, although the Dirichlet distribution is not an appropriate choice in this case. It is very common to model a regression problem using a normal likelihood (Bishop, 2006). As such, there are multiple

potential choices for a prior distribution. The methods listed in table 2 either choose the Normal-Inverse Gamma distribution (Amini et al., 2020; Charpentier et al., 2021), inducing a scaled inverse $\chi^2$  posterior (Gelman et al., 1995),<sup>11</sup> as well as a Normal-Wishart prior (Malinin et al., 2020a). We will discuss these approaches in turn.

Amini et al. (2020) models the regression problem as a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance  $\mathcal{N}(y;\mu,\sigma^2)$ , and as such use a normal prior for the mean with  $\mu \sim \mathcal{N}(\gamma,\sigma^2v^{-1})$  and an inverse Gamma prior for the variance with  $\sigma^2 \sim \Gamma^{-1}(\alpha,\beta)$ , resulting in a combined Inverse-Gamma prior with parameters  $\gamma, v, \alpha, \beta$ . These are then predicted by different "heads" of a neural network. Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty can then be estimated using the expected value of the variance as well as the variance of the mean, respectively, which have closed form solutions under this parameterization. The model is optimized using a negative log-likelihood objective along with an evidence regularizer, akin to the entropy one for Dirichlet networks. In the work of Charpentier et al. (2021), the authors generalize the approach behind the posterior networks by Charpentier et al. (2020) to different distributions from the exponential family, keeping architecture and loss function the same. Depending on the distributions used however, the UCE loss by Biloš et al. (2019) takes on a different form. Malinin et al. (2020a) can be seen as the multivariate generalization of the work of Amini et al. (2020), where a combined Normal-Wishart prior is formed to fit the now multivariate normal likelihood. Again, the prior parameters are the output of a neural network, and uncertainty can be quantified in a similar way. For training purposes, they apply the reverse KL objective of Malinin & Gales (2019) as well as the knowledge distillation objective of Malinin et al. (2020b).

# 5 RELATED WORK

The need for the quantification of uncertainty in order to earn the trust of end-users and stakeholders has been a key driver for research (Bhatt et al., 2021). Unfortunately, standard neural discriminator architectures have been proven to possess unwanted theoretical properties w.r.t. to OOD inputs<sup>12</sup> (Hein et al., 2019; Ulmer & Cinà, 2020) and lacking calibration in practice (Guo et al., 2017).

A popular way to overcome these blemishes is by quantifying (epistemic) uncertainty by aggregating multiple predictions by networks in the Bayesian Model Averaging framework (Jeffreys, 1998; Wilson & Izmailov, 2020), using variational methods (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Blundell et al., 2015), assembling (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) or mixtures of the two (Pearce et al., 2020; Wilson & Izmailov, 2020). Nevertheless, many of these methods have been shown not to produce diverse predictions (Wilson & Izmailov, 2020; Fort et al., 2019) and to deliver subpar performance and potentially misleading uncertainty estimates under distributional shift (Ovadia et al., 2019; Masegosa, 2019; Wenzel et al., 2020; Izmailov et al., 2021a,b), raising doubts about their efficacy.

The Evidential Deep Learning methods in §3.3 and §4 can be seen as single-pass alternatives that avoid approximating the predictive distribution in eq. 3 via Monte Carlo estimates. The proposed

Posterior Network (Charpentier et al., 2020; 2021) can furthermore be seen as related to another, competing approach, namely the combination of neural discriminators with density estimation methods, for instance in the form of energy-based models (Grathwohl et al., 2020; Elflein et al., 2021) or other hybrid architectures (Lee et al., 2018; Mukhoti et al., 2021).

# 6 DISCUSSION

Despite their advantages, the last chapters have highlighted key weaknesses of Dirichlet networks as well: In order to achieve the right behavior of the distribution and thus guarantee sensible uncertainty estimates, some approaches Malinin & Gales (2018; 2019); Nandy et al. (2020); Malinin et al. (2020a) require out-of-distribution data points during training. This comes with two problems: Such data is often not available or in the first place, or cannot guarantee robustness against other kinds of unseen OOD data, of which infinite types exist in a real-valued feature space. $^{13}$  Indeed, Kopetzki et al. (2021) found OOD detection to deteriorate across a family of Dirichlet-based models under adversarial perturbation and OOD data points. One possible explanation for this behavior might lie in the insight that neural networks trained in the empirical risk minimization framework might learn spurious but highly predictive features (Ilyas et al., 2019; Nagarajan et al., 2020). This way, inputs stemming from the training distribution might be mapped to similar parts of the latent space as data points outside the distribution even though they have (from a human perspective) blatant semantic differences, simply because these semantic features were not useful to optimize for the training objective. This can result in ID and OOD points having assigned similar feature representations by a network, a phenomenon has been coined "feature collapse" (Nalisnick et al., 2019; van Amersfoort et al., 2021; Havtorn et al., 2021). One strategy to mitigate (but not solve) this issue has been to enforce a constraint on the smoothness of the neural network function (Wei et al., 2018; van Amersfoort et al., 2020; 2021; Liu et al., 2020), thereby enforcing both a sensitivity to semantic changes in the input and robustness against adversarial inputs (Yu et al., 2019). Nevertheless, this question remains an open area of research and the impact on evidential deep learning methods underexplored.

# 7 CONCLUSION

This survey has given an overview over contemporary approaches for uncertainty estimation using neural networks to parameterize conjugate priors or the corresponding posteriors instead of likelihoods, with a focus on the Dirichlet distribution in a classification context. We highlighted their appealing theoretical properties allowing for uncertainty estimation with minimal computational overhead, rendering them as a viable alternative to existing approaches. We also emphasized practical problems: In order to nudge models towards the desired behavior in the face of unseen or out-of-distribution samples, the design of the model architecture and loss function have to be carefully considered. At the moment, the entropy regularizer seems to be a sensible choice in prior networks when OOD data is not available. Combining discriminators with generative models like normalizing flows like in (Charpentier et al., 2020; 2021), embedded a sturdy Bayesian framework, also appears as an exciting direction for practical applications. In summary, we believe that recent advances show promising results for Evidential Deep Learning, making it a viable option in the realm of uncertainty estimation to improve safety and trustworthiness in Machine Learning systems.
