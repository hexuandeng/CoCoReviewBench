# ABSTRACT

There are families of neural networks that can learn to compute any function, provided sufficient training data. However, given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model. Here we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge, such as knowing the overall recursive structure of a sequence transduction program or the fact that a program will likely use arithmetic operations on real numbers to solve a task. To this end we present a differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth. Through a neural implementation of the dual stack machine that underlies Forth, programmers can write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behaviour trained from program input-output data. As the program interpreter is end-to-end differentiable, we can optimize this behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user specified objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation graph. We show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage different levels of prior program structure and learn complex transduction tasks such as sequence sorting or addition with substantially less data and better generalisation over problem sizes. In addition, we introduce neural program optimisations based on symbolic computation and parallel branching that lead to significant speed improvements.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A central goal of Artificial Intelligence is the creation of machines that learn as effectively from human instruction as they do from data. A recent and important step towards this goal is the invention of neural architectures that can learn to perform algorithms akin to traditional computers, using primitives such as memory access and stack manipulation (Graves et al., 2014; Joulin & Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015; Kaiser & Sutskever, 2015; Kurach et al., 2015; Graves et al., 2016). These architectures can be trained through standard gradient descent methods, and enable machines to learn complex behavior from input-output pairs or program traces. In this context the role of the human programmer is often limited to providing training data. However, for many tasks training data is scarce. In these cases the programmer may have partial procedural background knowledge: one may know the rough structure of the program, or how to implement several sub-routines that are likely necessary to solve the task. For example, in visual programming, a user often knows a rough sketch of what they want to do, but need to fill in the specific components. In programming by demonstration (Lau et al., 2001) and programming with query languages (Neelakantan et al., 2015a) a user conforms to a larger set of conditions on the data, and needs to settle details. In all these scenarios, the question then becomes how to exploit this type of prior knowledge when learning algorithms.

To address the above question we present an approach that enables programmers to inject their procedural background knowledge into a neural network. In this approach the programmer specifies a program sketch (Solar-Lezama et al., 2005) in a traditional programming language. This sketch defines one part of the neural network behaviour. The other part is learned using training data. The core insight that enables this approach is the fact that most programming languages can be formulated

in terms of an abstract machine that executes the commands of the language. We implement these machines as neural networks, constraining parts of the networks to follow the sketched behaviour. The resulting neural programs are consistent with our prior knowledge and optimised with respect to the training data.

In this paper we focus on the programming language Forth (Brodie, 1980), a simple yet powerful stack-based language that is relatively close to machine code but enables modular programs and facilitates abstraction. Underlying Forth's semantics is a simple abstract machine. We introduce the Forth Neural Abstract Machine  $(\partial 4)$ , an implementation of this machine that is differentiable with respect to the transition it executes at each time step, as well as distributed input representations in the machine buffers. As sketches that users define are also differentiable, any underspecified program content contained within the sketch can be trained through backpropagation.

For two neural programming tasks introduced in previous work (Reed & de Freitas, 2015) we present Forth sketches that capture different degrees of prior knowledge. For example, we define only the general recursive structure of a sorting problem. We show that given only input-output pairs,  $\partial 4$  can learn to fill the sketch and generalise well to problems of unseen size. We also use  $\partial 4$  to investigate the type and degree of structure necessary when solving tasks, and show how symbolic execution can significantly improve execution time when applicable.

The contribution of our work is fourfold: i) we present a neural implementation of a dual stack machine underlying Forth, ii) we introduce Forth sketches for programming with partial procedural background knowledge, iii) we apply Forth sketches as a procedural prior on learning algorithms from data, and iv) we introduce program code optimisations based on symbolic execution that can speed up neural execution.

# 2 THE FORTH ABSTRACT MACHINE

Forth is a simple Turing-complete stack-based programming language (ANSI, 1994; Brodie, 1980). Its underlying abstract machine is represented by a state  $S = (D, R, H, c)$ , which contains two stacks: a data evaluation pushdown stack (data stack)  $D$  holds values for manipulation, and a return address pushdown stack (return stack)  $R$  assists with return pointers and subroutine calls. These are accompanied by a heap or random memory access buffer  $H$ , and a program counter  $c$ .

A Forth program  $P$  is a flat sequence of Forth words (i.e. commands)  $P = w_{1} \ldots w_{n}$ . The role of a word varies, encompassing language keywords, primitives, and user-defined subroutines (e.g. DROP, to discard the top element of the stack, or DUP, to duplicate the top element of the stack). Each word  $w_{i}$  defines a transition function between machine states,  $w_{i}: S \to S$ . Therefore, a program  $P$  itself defines a transition function by simply applying the word at the current program counter to the current state. Although usually considered as a part of the heap  $H$ , we consider Forth programs  $P$  separately to ease the analysis.

An example of a Forth program that implements the Bubble sort algorithm, is shown in Listing 1, and a detailed description of how this program is executed by the Forth abstract machine is provided in Appendix B. Notice that while Forth provides common control structures such as looping and branching, these can always be reduced to low-level code that uses jumps and conditional jumps (using the words BRANCH and BRANCH0, respectively). Likewise, we can think of sub-routine definitions as code blocks tagged with a label, and their invocation amounts to jumping to the tagged label.

# 3 THE DIFFERENTIABLE FORTH ABSTRACT MACHINE

When a programmer writes a Forth program, they define a sequence of Forth words, i.e., a sequence of known state transition functions. In other words, the programmer knows exactly how computation should proceed. To accommodate for cases when the developer's procedural background knowledge is incomplete, we extend Forth to support the definition of a program sketch. As is the case with Forth programs, sketches are sequences of transition functions. However, a sketch may contain transition functions whose behavior is learned from data.

![](images/a98960c10b0f000926a617c4af40a480e1e4338da7de060a617b86f59c2890bb.jpg)  
Figure 1: Neural Forth Abstract Machine. Forth sketch  $\mathbf{P}_{\theta}$  is translated to a low-level code, with the slot  $\{\dots\}$  substituted by a parametrised neural network. The slot is learnt from input-output examples  $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$  through the differentiable machine whose state  $\mathbf{S}_i$  comprises the low-level code and program counter  $\mathbf{c}$ , data stack  $\mathbf{D}$  (with pointer  $\mathbf{d}$ ), return stack  $\mathbf{R}$  (with pointer  $\mathbf{r}$ ), and the heap  $\mathbf{H}$ .

To learn the behaviour of transition functions within a program we would like the machine output to be differentiable with respect to these functions (and possibly representations of inputs to the program). This enables us to choose parameterized transition functions such as neural networks, and efficiently train their parameters through backpropagation and gradient methods. To this end we first provide a continuous representation of the state of a Forth abstract machine. We then present a recurrent neural network (RNN) that models program execution on this machine, parametrised by the transition functions at each time step. Lastly, we discuss optimizations based on symbolic execution and the interpolation of conditional branches.

# 3.1 MACHINE STATE ENCODING

We map the symbolic machine state  $S = (D, R, H, c)$  to a continuous representation  $\mathbf{S} = (\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{R}, \mathbf{H}, \mathbf{c})$  into two differentiable stacks (with pointers), the data stack  $\mathcal{D} = (\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{d})$  and the return stack  $\mathcal{R} = (\mathbf{R}, \mathbf{r})$ , a heap  $\mathbf{H}$ , and an attention vector  $\mathbf{c}$  indicating which word of the sketch  $\mathbf{P}_{\theta}$  is being executed at the current time step. All three memory structures, the data stack, the return stack and the heap, are based on differentiable flat memory buffers  $\mathbf{M} \in \{\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{R}, \mathbf{H}\}$ , where  $\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{R}, \mathbf{H} \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times v}$ , for a stack size  $l$  and a value size  $v$ . Each has a well-defined, differentiable read operation:

$$
\operatorname {r e a d} _ {\mathbf {M}} (\mathbf {a}) = \mathbf {a} ^ {T} \mathbf {M} \tag {1}
$$

and write operation:

$$
\operatorname {w r i t e} _ {\mathbf {M}} (\mathbf {x}, \mathbf {a}): \mathbf {M} \leftarrow \mathbf {M} - (\mathbf {a} \otimes \mathbf {1}) \odot \mathbf {M} + \mathbf {x} \otimes \mathbf {a} \tag {2}
$$

akin to the Neural Turing Machine (NTM) memory (Graves et al., 2014), where  $\otimes$  is the outer product,  $\odot$  is the Hadamard product, and  $\mathbf{a}$  is the address pointer. In addition to the memory buffers  $\mathbf{D}$  and  $\mathbf{R}$ , the data stack and the return stack contain pointers to the current top-of-the-stack (TOS) element  $\mathbf{d},\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^l$ . This allows us to implement pushing as writing a value  $\mathbf{x}$  into  $\mathbf{M}$  and incrementing the TOS pointer as follows:

$$
\operatorname {p u s h} _ {\mathbf {M}} (\mathbf {x}): \operatorname {w r i t e} _ {\mathbf {M}} (\mathbf {x}, \mathbf {p}) \quad [ \text {s i d e - e f f e c t}: \mathbf {p} \leftarrow \operatorname {i n c} (\mathbf {p}) ] \tag {3}
$$

where  $\mathbf{p} \in \{\mathbf{d}, \mathbf{r}\}$ ,  $\mathrm{inc}(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{p}^T \mathbf{R}^+$ , and  $\mathrm{dec}(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{p}^T \mathbf{R}^-$ . and  $\mathbf{R}^+$  and  $\mathbf{R}^-$  are increment and decrement matrices (left and right circular shift matrices).

Likewise, popping is realized by multiplying the TOS pointer and the memory buffer, and decreasing the TOS pointer:

$$
\operatorname {p o p} _ {\mathbf {M}} (\mathbf {\theta}) = \operatorname {r e a d} _ {\mathbf {M}} (\mathbf {p}) \quad [ \text {s i d e - e f f e c t :} \mathbf {p} \leftarrow \operatorname {d e c} (\mathbf {p}) ] \tag {4}
$$

Finally, the program counter  $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^p$  is a vector that, when one-hot, points to a single word in a program of length  $p$ , and is equivalent to the  $c$  vector of the symbolic state machine. We will use  $\mathcal{S}$  to denote the space of all continuous representations  $\mathbf{S}$ .

```

Neural Forth Words It is straightforward to convert Forth words, defined as functions on discrete machine states, to functions operating on the continuous space  $S$ . For example, consider the Forth word DUP, which duplicates the TOS element of the data stack. A differentiable version works by first calculating the value  $e$  on the TOS address of  $D$ , as  $e = d^T D$ . It then shifts the stack pointer via  $d \gets \text{inc}(d)$ , and writes  $e$  to  $D$  using  $\text{write}_D(e, d)$ . We present the complete description of implemented Forth Words in Appendix A and their differentiable counterparts in Appendix C.

# 3.2 FORTH SKETCHES

We define a Forth sketch  $\mathbf{P}_{\theta}$  as a sequence of continuous transition functions  $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{w}_1 \ldots \mathbf{w}_n$ . Here,  $\mathbf{w}_i \in S \to S$  either corresponds to a neural Forth word, or is a trainable transition function. We will call these trainable functions slots, as they correspond to underspecified "slots" in the program code that need to be filled by learned behaviour.

We allow users to define a slot  $\mathbf{w}$  by specifying a pair of a state encoder  $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{enc}}$  that produces a latent representation  $\mathbf{h}$  of the current machine state using a multi-layer perceptron, and a decoder  $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{dec}}$  that consumes this representation to produce the next machine state. We hence have  $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{dec}} \circ \mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{enc}}$ . To use slots within Forth program code we introduce a notation that reflects this decomposition. In particular, slots are defined using the syntax  $\{\text{encoder} \dashv \text{decoder}\}$  where encoder and decoder are specifications of the corresponding slot parts as described below.

Encoders We provide the following options for encoders:

- static: produces a static representation, independent of the actual machine state.  
- observe  $e_1 \ldots e_m$ : concatenates the elements  $e_1 \ldots e_m$  of the machine state. An element can be a stack item  $\mathsf{Di}$  at relative index  $i$ , a return stack item  $\mathbb{R}i$ , etc.

Decoders Users can specify the following decoders:

- choose  $w_{1} \ldots w_{m}$ : chooses from the Forth words  $w_{1} \ldots w_{m}$ . Takes an input vector  $\mathbf{h}$  of length  $m$  to produce a weighted combination of machine states  $\sum_{i}^{m} h_{i} \mathbf{w}_{\mathbf{i}}(\mathbf{S})$ .  
- manipulate  $e_1 \ldots e_m$ : directly manipulates the machine state elements  $e_1 \ldots e_m$ .  
- permute  $e_1 \ldots e_m$ : permutes the machine state elements  $e_1 \ldots e_m$ .

# 3.3 THE EXECUTION RNN

We model execution using an RNN which produces a state  $\mathbf{S}_{i + 1}$  conditioned on a previous state  $\mathbf{S}_i$ . It does so by first passing the current state to each function  $\mathbf{w}_i$  in the program, and then weighing each of the produced next states by the component of the program counter vector  $\mathbf{c}_i$  that corresponds to program index  $i$ , effectively using  $\mathbf{c}$  as an attention vector over code. Formally we have:

$$
\mathbf {S} _ {i + 1} = \operatorname {R N N} \left(\mathbf {S} _ {i}, \mathbf {P} _ {\theta}\right) = \sum_ {i} \mathbf {c} _ {i} \mathbf {w} _ {i} \left(\mathbf {S} _ {i}\right) \tag {5}
$$

Figure 2:  $\partial 4$  RNN execution of a of a Forth sketch. The pointers  $(\mathbf{d},\mathbf{r})$  and values (rows of  $\mathbf{R}$  and  $\mathbf{D}$ ) are all in one-hot state, while the program counter maintains. Subsequent states are discretised for clarity. Here the slot  $\{\dots\}$  has learned its optimal behaviour.

Clearly this recursion, and its final state, are differentiable with respect to the program code  $\mathbf{P}$ , and its inputs. Furthermore, for differentiable Forth programs it is easy to show that the final state of this RNN will correspond to the final state of a symbolic execution.

# 3.3.1  $\partial 4$  EXECUTION OF A BUBBLESORT SKETCH

Listing 2 defines the BUBBLE word as a sketch capturing several types of prior knowledge. In this section we describe the PERMUTE sketch. For instance, we assume BUBBLE involves a recursive call, that it terminates at length 1, and that the next BUBBLE call takes as input some function of the current length and the top two elements. In the sketch both the sequence to sort and its length minus  $1$ ,  $n - 1$ , are set on the data stack. After  $n - 1$  is duplicated for further use, the machine tests whether  $n - 1$  is non-zero (using IF, which consumes the TOS during the check). If  $n - 1 > 0$ , it is decremented, and stored on the  $R$  stack.

At this point the programmer only knows that a decision must be made based on the top two data stack elements D0 and D-1, and the top return stack, R0. Here the precise nature of this decision unknown, but is limited to variants of permutation of these elements, the output of which produce the input state to the recursive BUBBLE call (line 2 in Listing 2). At the culmination of the call, R0, the output of the learned slot behavior, is moved onto the data stack using  $\mathbb{R}>$ , and execution proceeds to the next step.

Figure 2 illustrates how portions of this sketch are executed on the  $\partial 4$  RNN. The program counter initially resides at 1- (line 3 in Listing 2), as indicated by the one-hot vector  $\mathbf{c}$ , next to program  $\mathbf{P}$ . Both data and return stack are partially filled ( $\mathcal{R}$  has 1 element,  $\mathcal{D}$  has 3), and we show the content both through horizontal one-hot vectors and their corresponding integer values. The vectors  $\mathbf{d}$  and  $\mathbf{r}$  point to the top of both stacks, and are in a one-hot state as well. In this execution trace the slot at line 4 is already showing optimal behaviour: it remembers the element on the return stack (4) is larger, and executes BUBBLE on the remaining sequence with the counter  $n$  subtracted by one, to 1.

# 3.4 PROGRAM CODE OPTIMIZATIONS

The  $\partial 4$  RNN requires one time step per transition. After each time step the program counter is either incremented or decremented by one, or explicitly set or popped from the stack to jump. In turn a new machine state is calculated by executing all words in the program, and then weighting the result states by the activation of the program counter at the given word. This parallel execution of all words is expensive, and it is therefore advisable to avoid full RNN steps wherever possible. We use two strategies to significantly speed-up  $\partial 4$ .

Symbolic Execution Whenever we have a sequence of Forth words that contains no branch entry or exit points, we collapse this sequence to a single transition. We do this using symbolic execution (King, 1976): we first fill the stacks and heap of a standard Forth abstract machine with symbols representing arbitrary values (e.g.  $D = d_{1} \ldots d_{l}$  and  $R = r_{1} \ldots r_{l}$ ), and execute the sequence of Forth words on the machine. This results in a new symbolic state. We use this state, and its difference to the original state, to derive the transition function of the complete sequence. For example, the sequence  $\mathbb{R} > \text{SWAP} > \mathbb{R}$  that swaps the top data stack with the top of the return stack yields the symbolic state  $D = r_{1}d_{2} \ldots d_{l}$ . And  $R = d_{1}r_{2} \ldots r_{l}$ . Compared to the initial state we have only changed the top elements on both stacks, and hence the neural transition will only need to swap the top elements of  $\mathbf{D}$  and  $\mathbf{R}$ .

Interpolation of If-Branches When symbolic execution hits a branching point we generally cannot simply continue execution, as the branching behaviour will depend on the current machine state and we cannot symbolically resolve it. However, for branches arising from if-clauses that involve no function calls or loop structures, we can still avoid giving control back to the program counter and evaluating all words. We simply execute both branches in parallel, and then let the resulting state be the sum of the output states of both branches, weighted by the score given to the symbol TRUE expected on top of the data stack.

# 3.5 TRAINING

Our training procedure assumes input-output pairs of machine start and end states  $(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_i)$  only. The output  $\mathbf{y}_i$  defines a target memory  $\mathbf{Y}_i^D$  and a target pointer  $\mathbf{y}_i^d$  on the data stack  $\mathbf{D}$ . Additionally, we may have a mask  $\mathbf{K}_i$  that indicates which components of the stack should be assessed and which should be ignored. For example, we do not care about values in the stack buffer above the target stack depth, dependent on  $\mathbf{y}_i^d$ . We use  $\mathbf{D}_T(\theta, \mathbf{x}_i)$  and  $\mathbf{d}_T(\theta, \mathbf{x}_i)$  to denote the final state of  $\mathbf{D}$  and  $\mathbf{d}$  after  $T$  steps of execution RNN, when using initial state  $\mathbf{x}_i$ , and define the loss function:

$$
\mathcal {L} (\theta) = \sum_ {i} \mathbf {K} _ {i} \odot \left(\mathbf {D} _ {T} \left(\theta , \mathbf {x} _ {i}\right) - \mathbf {Y} _ {i} ^ {D}\right) ^ {2} + \sum_ {i} \left(\mathbf {d} _ {T} \left(\theta , \mathbf {x} _ {i}\right) - \mathbf {y} _ {i} ^ {d}\right) ^ {2} \tag {6}
$$

We can use backpropagation and any variant of SGD to optimise our loss function. Note that it is trivial to also provide supervision of the intermediate states (trace-level), as done by the Neural Program Interpreter Reed & de Freitas (2015).

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We test  $\partial 4$  on sorting and addition tasks presented in Reed & de Freitas (2015) with varying levels of program structure. The presented sketches were trained with Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), with gradient clipping and gradient noise (Neelakantan et al., 2015b). Hyperparameters were tuned via random search on a development variant of each task, 1000 epochs, repeating each experiment 5 times. During test time we employ memory element discretisation, replacing differentiable stacks and pointers with their discrete counterparts.

# 4.1 SORTING

Sorting sequences of digits is a hard task for RNNs such as LSTMs, as they fail to generalize to sequences that are marginally longer than the ones they have been trained on (Reed & de Freitas, 2015). We investigate several strong priors based on BubbleSort for this transduction task and present two  $\partial 4$  sketches that enable us to learn sorting from only few training examples.

1. PERMUTE. Described in the Listing 2 code, the PERMUTE sketch specifies that three elements (the top two elements of the stack, and the top of the return stack) must be permuted based on the former's values. Both the value comparison and the permutation behavior must be learned from input-output examples.  
2. COMPAR. An alternative sketch is described in the Listing 2 comments (lines 5 and 6), which provides additional procedural prior knowledge. In contrast to PERMUTE, only the comparison between the top two elements on the stack must be learned.

Figure 4: Program Counter traces for a single example at different stages of training BubbleSort in Listing 2 (red: successive recursion calls to BUBBLE, green: successive returns from the recursion, and blue: calls to SORT). The last element in the last row is the halting command, which only gets executed after learning the correct slot behavior.

In both sketches, the outer loop can be specified in  $\partial 4$  with line 9 of Listing 1, which repeatedly calls a function BUBBLE. This defines sufficient structure so that the network's behavior is invariant to the input sequence length.

Figure 3a shows training and test accuracies for the two sketches discussed above when varying the number of training instances. Here, training sequences are of length 3 and test sequences of length 8. As expected, providing less structure (PERMUTE sketch) results in a worse fit on the training set when given only few training examples. However, with more training examples the PERMUTE sketch with less prior structure generalize as well as the COMPARE sketch. For 256 training examples both sketches learn the correct behavior and generalize to sequences that are over six times long.

It is interesting to analyse the program counter traces, depicted in Figure 4. The trace follows a single example from start, to middle, and the end of the training process. In the beginning of training, the program counter starts to deviate from the one-hot representation in the first 20 steps (not observed in the figure due to unobservable changes), and after 2 iterations of SORT,  $\partial 4$  fails to correctly determine the next word. After a few training epochs  $\partial 4$  learns better permutations which enables the algorithm to take crisp decisions and halt in the correct state.

Program Code Optimizations We measure the runtime of BubbleSort on sequences of varying length with and without the optimizations described in Section 3.4. The results of ten repeated runs are shown in Figure 3b and demonstrate large relative improvements for symbolic execution and interpolation of if-branches compared to non-optimized  $\partial 4$  code.

# 4.2 ADDITION

Next we applied  $\partial 4$  to the problem of learning to add two numbers of  $n$  digits each. We rely on the standard elementary school addition algorithm, where the goal is to iterate over pairs of the aligned digits, calculating the sum of each to yield the sum of the original numbers. The key complication arises when two digits sum to a two-digit number, requiring that the correct extra digit be carried over to the subsequent column.

A sketch for the addition algorithm is shown in Listing 3. As input it requires the aligned pairs of digits, a carry for the least significant digit (potentially 0), and the length of the respective numbers. The sketch defines the high-level operations through recursion, leaving the core addition algorithm to be learned by data. The specified high-level behavior includes the recursive call template and the halting condition of the recursion (no remaining digits, line 1-2). The underspecified addition operation must take three digits from the previous call, the two digits to sum and a previous carry, and produce a single digit (the sum) and the resultant carry. The sketch then reduces the problem size by one, and returns the solution by popping it from the return stack.

We trained the sketch on a training set of 200 single-digit addition examples. The presented sketch, when trained on single-digit addition examples, successfully learns the addition, and generalises to longer sequences.

# 5 RELATED WORK

Program Synthesis The idea of program synthesis is as old as Artificial Intelligence, and has a long history in computer science (Manna & Waldinger, 1971). Whereas a large body of work has focused on using genetic programming (Koza, 1992) to induce programs from the given input-output specification (Nordin, 1997), there are also various Inductive Programming approaches (Kitzelmann, 2009) aimed at inducing programs from incomplete specifications of the code to be implemented (Albarghouthi et al., 2013; Solar-Lezama et al., 2006). We tackle the same problem of sketching, but in our case we fill the sketches with neural networks able to learn the slot behavior.

Probabilistic and Bayesian Programming Our work is closely related to probabilistic programming languages such as Church (Goodman et al., 2008). They allow users to inject random choice primitives into programs as a way to define generative distributions over possible execution traces. In a sense, the random choice primitives in such languages correspond to the slots in our sketches. A core difference lies in the way we train the behaviour of slots: instead of calculating their posteriors using probabilistic inference, we estimate their parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent, similar to TerpreT (Gaunt et al., 2016), who induce code via backpropagation, and Autograd (Maclaurin et al., 2015), who enable automatic gradient computation in Python code. In addition, the underlying programming and probabilistic paradigm in these programming languages is often functional and declarative, whereas our approach focuses on a procedural and discriminative view. By using an end-to-end differentiable architecture, it is easy to seamlessly connect our

sketches to further neural input and output modules, such as an LSTM that feeds into the machine heap, or a neural reinforcement learning agent that operates the neural machine. However, we leave connecting  $\partial 4$  with neural upstream and downstream models for future work as it is out of the scope of this paper.

Neural approaches Recently, there has been a surge of research in program synthesis, and execution in deep learning, with increasingly elaborate deep models. Many of these models were based on differentiable versions of abstract data structures (Joulin & Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015; Kurach et al., 2015), and a few abstract machines, such as the NTM (Graves et al., 2014), Differentiable Neural Computers (Graves et al., 2016), and Neural GPUs (Kaiser & Sutskever, 2015). All these models are able to induce algorithmic behavior from training data. Our work differs in that our differentiable abstract machine allows us to seemingly integrate code and neural networks, and train the neural networks specified by slots via backpropagation through code interpretation.

The work in neural approximations to abstract structures and machines naturally leads to more elaborate machinery able to induce and call code or code-like behavior. Neelakantan et al. (2015a) learned SQL-like behavior—querying tables from natural language with simple arithmetic operations. Andreas et al. (2016) learn to compose neural modules to produce a desired behavior for a visual QA task. Neural Programmer-Interpreters (Reed & de Freitas, 2015) learn to represent and execute programs, operating on different modes of environment, and are able to incorporate decisions better captured in a neural network than in many lines of code (e.g. using image as an input). Users inject prior procedural knowledge by training on program traces and hence require full procedural knowledge. In contrast, we enable users to use their partial knowledge in sketches.

Neural approaches to language compilation have also been researched, from compiling a language into neural networks (Siegelmann, 1994), over building neural compilers (Gruau et al., 1995) to adaptive compilation (Bunel et al., 2016). However, that line of research did not perceive neural interpreters and compilers as a means of injecting procedural knowledge as we did. To the best of our knowledge,  $\partial 4$  is the first working neural implementation of an abstract machine for an actual programming language, and this enables us to inject such priors in a straightforward manner.

# 6 CONCLUSION

We have presented  $\partial 4$ , a differentiable abstract machine for the Forth programming language, and showed how it can be used to complement a programmer's prior knowledge through the learning of unspecified behavior in Forth sketches. The  $\partial 4$  RNN successfully learns to sort and add, using only program sketches and program input-output pairs as input. We believe  $\partial 4$ , and the larger paradigm it helps establish, will be useful for addressing complex problems where low-level representations of the input are necessary, but higher-level reasoning is difficult to learn and potentially easier to specify. In future work we plan to apply  $\partial 4$  to such problems in the NLP domain, like machine reading and knowledge base inference. The integration of non-differentiable transitions (such as those arising when interacting with a real environment), is also an exciting future direction which sits at the intersection of reinforcement learning and probabilistic programming.
