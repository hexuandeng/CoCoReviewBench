# ABSTRACT

In this paper, we introduce the notion of reproducible policies in the context of stochastic bandits, one of the canonical problems in interactive learning. A policy in the bandit environment is called reproducible if it pulls, with high probability, the exact same sequence of arms in two different and independent executions (i.e., under independent reward realizations). We show that not only do reproducible policies exist, but also they achieve almost the same optimal (non-reproducible) regret bounds in terms of the time horizon. More specifically, in the stochastic multi-armed bandits setting, we develop a policy with an optimal problem-dependent regret bound whose dependence on the reproducibility parameter is also optimal. Similarly, for stochastic linear bandits (with finitely and infinitely many arms) we develop reproducible policies that achieve the best-known problem-independent regret bounds with an optimal dependency on the reproducibility parameter. Our results show that even though randomization is crucial for the exploration-exploitation trade-off, an optimal balance can still be achieved while pulling the exact same arms in two different rounds of executions.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

In order for scientific findings to be valid and reliable, the experimental process must be repeatable, and must provide coherent results and conclusions across these repetitions. In fact, lack of reproducibility has been a major issue in many scientific areas; a 2016 survey that appeared in Nature (Baker, 2016a) revealed that more than  $70\%$  of researchers failed in their attempt to reproduce another researcher's experiments. What is even more concerning is that over  $50\%$  of them failed to reproduce their own findings. Similar concerns have been raised by the machine learning community, e.g., the ICLR 2019 Reproducibility Challenge (Pineau et al., 2019) and NeurIPS 2019 Reproducibility Program (Pineau et al., 2021), due to the to the exponential increase in the number of publications and the reliability of the findings.

The aforementioned empirical evidence has recently led to theoretical studies and rigorous definitions of reproducibility. In particular, the works of Impagliazzo et al. (2022) and Ahn et al. (2022) considered reproducibility as an algorithmic property through the lens of (offline) learning and convex optimization, respectively. In a similar vein, in the current work, we introduce the notion of reproducibility in the context of interactive learning and decision making. In particular, we study reproducible policy design for the fundamental setting of stochastic bandits.

A multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a one-player game that is played over  $T$  rounds where there is a set of different arms/actions  $\mathcal{A}$  of size  $|\mathcal{A}| = K$  (in the more general case of linear bandits, we can consider even an infinite number of arms). In each round  $t = 1,2,\dots,T$ , the player pulls an arm  $a_{t}\in \mathcal{A}$  and receives a corresponding reward  $r_t$ . In the stochastic setting, the rewards of each arm are sampled in each round independently, from some fixed but unknown, distribution supported on [0, 1]. Crucially, each arm has a potentially different reward distribution, but the distribution of each arm is fixed over time. A bandit algorithm  $\mathbb{A}$  at every round  $t$  takes as input the sequence of arm-reward pairs that it has seen so far, i.e.,  $(a_1,r_1),\ldots ,(a_{t - 1},r_{t - 1})$ , then uses (potentially) some internal randomness  $\xi$  to pull an arm  $a_{t}\in \mathcal{A}$  and, finally, observes the associated reward  $r_t\sim \mathcal{D}_{a_t}$ .

We propose the following natural notion of a reproducible bandit algorithm, which is inspired by the definition of Impagliazzo et al. (2022). Intuitively, a bandit algorithm is reproducible if two distinct executions of the algorithm, with internal randomness fixed between both runs, but with independent reward realizations, give the exact same sequence of played arms, with high probability. More formally, we have the following definition.

Definition 1 (Reproducible Bandit Algorithm). Let  $\rho \in [0,1]$ . We call a bandit algorithm  $\mathbb{A}$ $\rho$ -reproducible in the stochastic setting if for any distribution  $\mathcal{D}_{a_j}$  over  $[0,1]$  of the rewards of the  $j$ -th arm  $a_j \in \mathcal{A}$ , and for any two executions of  $\mathbb{A}$ , where the internal randomness  $\xi$  is shared across the executions, it holds that

$$
\mathbf {\Pi} _ {\xi , \boldsymbol {r} ^ {(1)}, \boldsymbol {r} ^ {(2)}} ^ {\mathbf {P r}} \left[ \left(a _ {1} ^ {(1)}, \dots , a _ {T} ^ {(1)}\right) = \left(a _ {1} ^ {(2)}, \dots , a _ {T} ^ {(2)}\right) \right] \geq 1 - \rho .
$$

Here,  $a_{t}^{(i)} = \mathbb{A}(a_{1}^{(i)},r_{1}^{(i)},\dots,a_{t - 1}^{(i)},r_{t - 1}^{(i)};\xi)$  is the t-th action taken by the algorithm  $\mathbb{A}$  in execution  $i\in \{1,2\}$ .

The reason why we allow for some fixed internal randomness is that the algorithm designer has control over it, e.g., they can use the same seed for their (pseudo)random generator between two executions. Clearly, naively designing a reproducible bandit algorithm is not quite challenging. For instance, an algorithm that always pulls the same arm or an algorithm that plays the arms in a particular random sequence determined by the shared random seed  $\xi$  are both reproducible. The caveat is that the performance of these algorithms in terms of expected regret will be quite poor. In this work, we aim to design bandit algorithms which are reproducible and enjoy small expected regret. In the stochastic setting, the (expected) regret after  $T$  rounds is defined as

$$
\mathbf {E} [ R _ {T} ] = T \max _ {a \in \mathcal {A}} \mu_ {a} - \mathbf {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \mu_ {a _ {t}} \right],
$$

where  $\mu_{a} = \mathbf{E}_{r\sim \mathcal{D}_{a}}[r]$  is the mean reward for arm  $a\in \mathcal{A}$ . In a similar manner, we can define the regret in the more general setting of linear bandits (see, Section 5) Hence, the overarching question in this work is the following:

Is it possible to design reproducible bandit algorithms with small expected regret?

At a first glance, one might think that this is not possible, since it looks like reproducibility contradicts the exploratory behavior that a bandit algorithm should possess. However, our main results answer this question in the affirmative and can be summarized in Table 1.

# 1.1 RELATED WORK

Reproducibility In this work, we introduce the notion of reproducibility in the context of interactive learning and, in particular, in the fundamental setting of stochastic bandits. Close to our work, the notion of a reproducible algorithm in the context of learning was proposed by Impagliazzo et al. (2022), where it is shown how any statistical query algorithm can be made reproducible with a moderate increase in its sample complexity. Using this result, they provide reproducible algorithms for finding approximate heavy-hitters, medians, and the learning of half-spaces. Reproducibility has been also considered in the context of optimization by Ahn et al. (2022). We mention that in Ahn et al. (2022) the notion of a reproducible algorithm is different from our work and that of Impagliazzo et al. (2022), in the sense that the outputs of two different executions of the algorithm do not

need to be exactly the same. From a more application-oriented perspective, Shamir & Lin (2022) study irreproducibility in recommendation systems and propose the use of smooth activations (instead of ReLUs) to improve recommendation reproducibility. In general, the reproducibility crisis is reported in various scientific disciplines (Ioannidis, 2005; McNutt, 2014; Baker, 2016b; Goodman et al., 2016; Lucic et al., 2018; Henderson et al., 2018). For more details we refer to the report of the NeurIPS 2019 Reproducibility Program (Pineau et al., 2021) and the ICLR 2019 Reproducibility Challenge (Pineau et al., 2019).

Bandit Algorithms Stochastic multi-armed bandits for the general setting without structure have been studied extensively (Slivkins, 2019; Lattimore & Szepesvári, 2020; Bubeck et al., 2012b; Auer et al., 2002; Cesa-Bianchi & Fischer, 1998; Kaufmann et al., 2012a; Audibert et al., 2010; Agrawal & Goyal, 2012; Kaufmann et al., 2012b). In this setting, the optimum regret achievable is  $O\left(\log(T)\sum_{i:\Delta_i > 0}\Delta^{-1}\right)$ ; this is achieved, e.g., by the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm of Auer et al. (2002). The setting of  $d$ -dimensional linear stochastic bandits is also well-explored (Dani et al., 2008; Abbasi-Yadtori et al., 2011) under the well-specified linear reward model, achieving (near) optimal problem-independent regret of  $O(d\sqrt{T\log(T)})$  (Lattimore & Szepesvári, 2020). Note that the best-known lower bound is  $\Omega(d\sqrt{T})$  (Dani et al., 2008) and that the number of arms can, in principle, be unbounded. For a finite number of arms  $K$ , the best known upper bound is  $O(d\sqrt{T\log(K)})$  (Bubeck et al., 2012a). Our work focuses on the design of reproducible bandit algorithms and we hence consider only stochastic environments. In general, there is also extensive work in adversarial bandits and we refer the interested reader to Lattimore & Szepesvári (2020).

Batched Bandits While sequential bandit problems have been studied for almost a century, there is much interest in the batched setting too. In many settings, like medical trials, one has to take a lot of actions in parallel and observe their rewards later. The works of Auer & Ortner (2010) and Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2013) provided sequential bandit algorithms which can easily work in the batched setting. The works of Gao et al. (2019) and Esfandiari et al. (2021) are focusing exclusively on the batched setting. Our work on reproducible bandits builds upon some of the techniques from these two lines of work.

# 2 STOCHASTIC BANDITS AND REPRODUCIBILITY

In this section, we first highlight the main challenges in order to guarantee reproducibility and then discuss how the results of Impagliazzo et al. (2022) can be applied in our setting.

# 2.1 WARM-UP I: NAIVE REPRODUCIBILITY AND CHALLENGES

Let us consider the stochastic two-arm setting  $(K = 2)$  and a bandit algorithm  $\mathbb{A}$  with two independent executions,  $\mathbb{A}_1$  and  $\mathbb{A}_2$ . The algorithm  $\mathbb{A}_i$  plays the sequence  $1, 2, 1, 2, \ldots$  until some, potentially random, round  $T_i \in \mathbb{N}$  after which one of the two arms is eliminated and, from that point, the algorithm picks the winning arm  $j_i \in \{1, 2\}$ . The algorithm  $\mathbb{A}$  is  $\rho$ -reproducible if and only if  $T_1 = T_2$  and  $j_1 = j_2$  with probability  $1 - \rho$ .

Assume that  $|\mu_1 - \mu_2| = \Delta$  where  $\mu_i$  is the mean of the distribution of the  $i$ -th arm. If we assume that  $\Delta$  is known, then we can run the algorithm for  $T_1 = T_2 = \frac{C}{\Delta^2} \log(1 / \rho)$  for some universal constant  $C > 0$  and obtain that, with probability  $1 - \rho$ , it will hold that  $\widehat{\mu}_1^{(j)} \approx \mu_1$  and  $\widehat{\mu}_2^{(j)} \approx \mu_2$  for  $j \in \{1, 2\}$ , where  $\widehat{\mu}_i^{(j)}$  is the estimation of arm's  $i$  mean during execution  $j$ . Hence, knowing  $\Delta$  implies that the stopping criterion of the algorithm  $\mathbb{A}$  is deterministic and that, with high probability, the winning arm will be detected at time  $T_1 = T_2$ . This will make the algorithm  $\rho$ -reproducible.

Observe that when  $K = 2$ , the only obstacle to reproducibility is that the algorithm should decide at the same time to select the winning arm and the selection must be the same in the two execution threads. In the presence of multiple arms, there exists the additional constraint that the above conditions must be satisfied during, potentially, multiple arm eliminations. Hence, the two questions arising from the above discussion are (i) how to modify the above approach when  $\Delta$  is unknown and (ii) how to deal with  $K > 2$  arms.

A potential solution to the second question (on handling  $K > 2$  arms) is the Execute-Then-Commit (ETC) strategy. Consider the stochastic  $K$ -arm bandit setting. For any  $\rho \in (0,1)$ , the ETC algorithm with known  $\Delta = \min_{i} \Delta_{i}$  and horizon  $T$  that uses  $m = \frac{4}{\Delta^2} \log(1 / \rho)$  deterministic exploration phases before commitment is  $\rho$ -reproducible. The intuition is exactly the same as in the  $K = 2$  case. The caveats of this approach are that it assumes that  $\Delta$  is known and that the obtained regret is quite unsatisfying. In particular, it achieves regret bounded by  $m \sum_{i \in [K]} \Delta_{i} + \rho \cdot (T - mK) \sum_{i \in [k]} \Delta_{i}$ .

Next, we discuss how to improve the regret bound without knowing the gaps  $\Delta_{i}$ . Before designing new algorithms, we will inspect the guarantees that can be obtained by combining ideas from previous results in the bandits literature and the recent work in reproducible learning of Impagliazzo et al. (2022).

# 2.2 WARM-UP II: BANDIT ALGORITHMS AND REPRODUCIBLE MEAN ESTIMATION

First, we remark that we work in the stochastic setting and the distributions of the rewards of the two arms are subgaussian. Thus, the problem of estimating their mean is an instance of a statistical query for which we can use the algorithm of Impagliazzo et al. (2022) to get a reproducible mean estimator for the distributions of the rewards of the arms.

Proposition 2 (Reproducible Mean Estimation (Impagliazzo et al., 2022)). Let  $\tau, \delta, \rho \in [0,1]$ . There exists a  $\rho$ -reproducible algorithm ReprMeanEstimation that draws  $\Omega\left(\frac{\log(1 / \delta)}{\tau^2(\rho - \delta)^2}\right)$  samples from a distribution with mean  $\mu$  and computes an estimate  $\widehat{\mu}$  that satisfies  $|\widehat{\mu} - \mu| \leq \tau$  with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ .

Notice that we are working in the regime where  $\delta \ll \rho$ , so the sample complexity is  $\Omega\left(\frac{\log(1 / \delta)}{\tau^2\rho^2}\right)$ . The straightforward approach is to try to use an optimal multi-armed algorithm for the stochastic setting, such as UCB or arm-elimination (Even-Dar et al., 2006), combined with the reproducible mean estimator. However, it is not hard to see that this approach does not give meaningful results: if we want to achieve reproducibility  $\rho$  we need to call the reproducible mean estimator routine with parameter  $\rho /(KT)$ , due to the union bound that we need to take. This means that we need to pull every arm at least  $K^2 T^2$  times, so the regret guarantee becomes vacuous. This gives us the first key insight to tackle the problem: we need to reduce the number of calls to the mean estimator. Hence, we will draw inspiration from the line of work in stochastic batched bandits (Gao et al., 2019; Esfandiari et al., 2021) to derive reproducible bandit algorithms.

# 3 REPRODUCIBLE MEAN ESTIMATION FOR BATCHED BANDITS

As a first step, we would like to show how one could combine the existing reproducible algorithms of Impagliazzo et al. (2022) with the batched bandits approach of Esfandiari et al. (2021) to get some preliminary non-trivial results. We build an algorithm for the  $K$ -arm setting, where the gaps  $\Delta_j$  are unknown to the learner. Let  $\delta$  be the confidence parameter of the arm elimination algorithm and  $\rho$  be the reproducibility guarantee we want to achieve. Our approach is the following: let us, deterministically, split the time interval into sub-intervals of increasing length. We treat each sub-interval as a batch of samples where we pull each active arm the same number of times and use the reproducible mean estimation algorithm to, empirically, compute the true mean. At the end of each batch, we decide to eliminate some arm  $j$  using the standard UCB estimate. Crucially, if we condition on the event that all the calls to the reproducible mean estimator return the same number, then the algorithm we propose is reproducible.

Theorem 3. Let  $T \in \mathbb{N}, \rho \in (0,1]$ . There exists a  $\rho$ -reproducible algorithm (presented in Algorithm 1) for the stochastic bandit problem with  $K$  arms and gaps  $(\Delta_j)_{j \in [K]}$  whose expected regret is

$$
\mathbf {E} [ R _ {T} ] \leq C \cdot \frac {K ^ {2} \log^ {2} (T)}{\rho^ {2}} \sum_ {j: \Delta_ {j} > 0} \left(\Delta_ {j} + \frac {\log (K T \log (T))}{\Delta_ {j}}\right),
$$

where  $C > 0$  is an absolute numerical constant, and its running time is polynomial in  $K, T$  and  $1 / \rho$ .

7: Pull every arm  $a \in \mathcal{A}$  for  $\lfloor q^i \rfloor$  times

13: Remove  $a$  from  $\mathcal{A}$   
14: In the last batch play arg  $\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \widehat{\mu}_a$

The above result, whose proof can be found in Appendix A, states that, by combining the tools from Impagliazzo et al. (2022) and Esfandiari et al. (2021), we can design a reproducible bandit algorithm with (instance-dependent) expected regret  $O(K^2 \log^3(T) / \rho^2)$ . Notice that the regret guarantee has an extra  $K^2 \log^2(T) / \rho^2$  factor compared to its non-reproducible counterpart in Esfandiari et al. (2021) (Theorem 5.1). This is because, due to a union bound over the rounds and the arms, we need to call the reproducible mean estimator with parameter  $\rho / (K \log(T))$ . In the next section, we show how to get rid of the  $\log^2(T)$  by designing a new algorithm.

# 4 IMPROVED ALGORITHMS FOR REPRODUCIBLE STOCHASTIC BANDITS

While the previous result provides a non-trivial regret bound, it is not optimal with respect to the time horizon  $T$ . In this section, we show to improve it by designing a new algorithm, presented in Algorithm 2, which satisfies the guarantees of Theorem 4 and, essentially, decreases the dependence on the time horizon  $T$  from  $\log^3 (T)$  to  $\log (T)$ . Our main result for reproducible stochastic multiarmed bandits with  $K$  arms follows.

Theorem 4. Let  $T \in \mathbb{N}, \rho \in (0,1]$ . There exists a  $\rho$ -reproducible algorithm (presented in Algorithm 2) for the stochastic bandit problem with  $K$  arms and gaps  $(\Delta_j)_{j \in [K]}$  whose expected regret is

$$
\mathbf {E} [ R _ {T} ] \leq C \cdot \frac {K ^ {2}}{\rho^ {2}} \sum_ {j: \Delta_ {j} > 0} \left(\Delta_ {j} + \frac {\log (K T \log (T))}{\Delta_ {j}}\right),
$$

where  $C > 0$  is an absolute numerical constant, and its running time is polynomial in  $K, T$  and  $1 / \rho$ .

Note that, compared to the non-reproducible setting, we incur an extra factor of  $K^2 / \rho^2$  in the regret. The proof can be found in Appendix B. Let us now describe how Algorithm 2 works. We decompose the time horizon into  $B = \log(T)$  batches. Without the reproducibility constraint, one could draw  $q^i$  samples in batch  $i$  from each arm and estimate the mean reward. With the reproducibility constraint, we have to boost this: in each batch  $i$ , we pull each active arm  $O(\beta q^i)$  times, for some  $q$  to be determined, where  $\beta = O(K^2 / \rho^2)$  is the reproducibility blow-up. Using these samples, we compute the empirical mean  $\widehat{\mu}_{\alpha}^{(i)}$  for any active arm  $\alpha$ . Note that  $\widetilde{U}_i$  in Algorithm 2 corresponds to the size of the actual confidence interval of the estimation and  $U_i$  corresponds to the confidence interval of an algorithm that does not use the  $\beta$ -blow-up in the number of samples. The novelty of our approach comes from the choice of the interval around the mean of the maximum arm: we pick a threshold uniformly at random from an interval of size  $U_i / 2$  around the maximum mean. Then, the algorithm checks whether  $\widehat{\mu}_a^{(i)} + \widetilde{U}_i < \max \widehat{\mu}_{a'}^{(i)} - \overline{U}_i$ , where max runs over the active arms  $a'$  in batch  $i$ , and eliminates arms accordingly. To prove the result we show that there are three regions that some arm  $j$  can be in relative to the confidence interval of the best arm in batch  $i$  (cf. Appendix B). If

it lies in two of these regions, then the decision of whether to keep it or discard it is the same in both executions of the algorithm. However, if it is in the third region, the decision could be different between parallel executions, and since it relies on some external and unknown randomness, it is not clear how to reason about it. To overcome this issue, we use the random threshold to argue about the probability that the decision between two executions differs. The crucial observation that allows us to get rid of the extra  $\log^2 (T)$  factor is that there are correlations between consecutive batches: we prove that if some arm  $j$  lies in this "bad" region in some batch  $i$ , then it will be outside this region after a constant number of batches.

# 5 REPRODUCIBLE STOCHASTIC LINEAR BANDITS

We now investigate reproducibility in the more general setting of stochastic linear bandits. In this setting, each arm is a vector  $a \in \mathbb{R}^d$  belonging to some action set  $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ , and there is a parameter  $\theta^\star \in \mathbb{R}^d$  unknown to the player. In round  $t$ , the player chooses some action  $a_t \in \mathcal{A}$  and receives a reward  $r_t = \langle \theta^\star, a_t \rangle + \eta_t$ , where  $\eta_t$  is a zero-mean 1-subgaussian random variable independent of any other source of randomness. This means that  $\mathbf{E}[\eta_t] = 0$  and satisfies  $\mathbf{E}[\exp(\lambda \eta_t)] \leq \exp(\lambda^2/2)$  for any  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ . For normalization purposes, it is standard to assume that  $\| \theta^\star \|_2 \leq 1$  and  $\sup_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \| a \|_2 \leq 1$ . In the linear setting, the expected regret after  $T$  pulls  $a_1, \ldots, a_T$  can be written as

$$
\mathbf {E} \left[ R _ {T} \right] = T \sup  _ {a \in \mathcal {A}} \langle \theta^ {\star}, a \rangle - \mathbf {E} \left[ \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \langle \theta^ {\star}, a _ {t} \rangle \right].
$$

In Section 5.1 we provide results for the finite action space case, i.e., when  $|\mathcal{A}| = K$ . Next, in Section 5.2, we study reproducible linear bandit algorithms when dealing with infinite action spaces. In the following, we work in the regime where  $T \gg d$ . We underline that our approach leverages connections of stochastic linear bandits with G-optimal experiment design, core sets constructions, and least-squares estimators. Roughly speaking, the goal of G-optimal design is to find a (small) subset of arms  $\mathcal{A}'$ , which is called the core set, and define a distribution  $\pi$  over them with the following property: for any  $\varepsilon > 0$ ,  $\delta > 0$  pulling only these arms for an appropriate number of times and computing the least-squares estimate  $\widehat{\theta}$  guarantees that  $\sup_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\langle a,\theta^{*} - \widehat{\theta}\rangle \leq \varepsilon$ , with probability  $1 - \delta$ . For an extensive discussion, we refer to Chapters 21 and 22 of Lattimore & Szepesváris (2020).

# 5.1 FINITE ACTION SET

We first introduce a lemma that allows us to reduce the size of the action set that our algorithm has to search over.

Lemma 5 (See Chapters 21 and 22 in Lattimore & Szepesvári (2020)). For any finite action set  $\mathcal{A}$  that spans  $\mathbb{R}^d$  and any  $\delta, \varepsilon > 0$ , there exists an algorithm that, in time polynomial in  $d$ , computes a multi-set of  $\Theta(d\log(1/\delta)/\varepsilon^2 + d\log\log d)$  actions (possibly with repetitions) such that (i) they span  $\mathbb{R}^d$  and (ii) if we perform these actions in a batched stochastic  $d$ -dimensional linear bandits setting with true parameter  $\theta^\star \in \mathbb{R}^d$  and let  $\widehat{\theta}$  be the least-squares estimate for  $\theta^\star$ , then, for any  $a \in \mathcal{A}$ , with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ , we have  $\left|\left\langle a, \theta^\star - \widehat{\theta} \right\rangle \right| \leq \varepsilon$ .

Essentially, the multi-set in Lemma 5 is obtained using an approximate  $G$ -optimal design algorithm. Thus, it is crucial to check whether this can be done in a reproducible manner. Recall that the above set of distinct actions is called the core set and is the solution of an (approximate) G-optimal design problem. To be more specific, consider a distribution  $\pi : \mathcal{A} \to [0,1]$  and define  $V(\pi) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi(a) aa^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$  and  $g(\pi) = \sup_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \|a\|_{V(\pi)^{-1}}^2$ . The distribution  $\pi$  is called a design and the goal of G-optimal design is to find a design that minimizes  $g$ . Since the number of actions is finite, this problem reduces to an optimization problem which can be solved efficiently using standard optimization methods (e.g., the Frank-Wolfe method). Since the initialization is the same, the algorithm that finds the optimal (or an approximately optimal) design is reproducible under the assumption that the gradients and the projections do not have numerical errors. This perspective is orthogonal to the work of Ahn et al. (2022), that defines reproducibility from a different viewpoint.

Algorithm 3 Reproducible Algorithm for Stochastic Linear Bandits (Theorem 6)  
1: Input: number of arms  $K$ , time horizon  $T$ , reproducibility  $\rho$   
2: Initialization:  $B \leftarrow \log(T)$ ,  $q \leftarrow (T/c)^{1/B}$ ,  $\mathcal{A} \leftarrow [K]$ ,  $r \leftarrow T$   
3:  $\beta \leftarrow \lfloor \max\{K^2/\rho^2, 2304\} \rfloor$   
4: for  $i = 1$  to  $B - 1$  do  
5:  $\widetilde{\varepsilon}_i = \sqrt{d\log(KT^2) / (\beta q^i)}$   
6:  $\varepsilon_i = \sqrt{d\log(KT^2) / q^i}$   
7:  $n_i = 10d\log(KT^2) / \varepsilon_i^2$   
8:  $a_1, \ldots, a_{n_i} \leftarrow$  multi-set given by Lemma 5 with parameters  $\delta = 1/(KT^2)$  and  $\varepsilon = \widetilde{\varepsilon}_i$   
9: if  $n_i > r$  then  
10: break  
11: Pull every arm  $a_1, \ldots, a_{n_i}$  and receive rewards  $r_1, \ldots, r_{n_i}$   
12: Compute the LSE  $\widehat{\theta}_i \leftarrow \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} a_j a_j^T \right)^{-1} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} a_j r_j \right)$   
13:  $\overline{\varepsilon}_i \leftarrow \mathrm{Uni}[\varepsilon_i/2, \varepsilon_i]$   
14:  $r \leftarrow r - n_i$   
15: for  $a \in \mathcal{A}$  do  
16: if  $\langle a, \widehat{\theta}_i \rangle + \widetilde{\varepsilon}_i < \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\langle a, \widehat{\theta}_i \rangle - \overline{\varepsilon}_i$  then  
17: Remove  $a$  from  $\mathcal{A}$   
18: In the last batch play arg  $\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\langle a, \widehat{\theta}_{B-1} \rangle$

In our batched bandit algorithm (Algorithm 3), the multi-set of arms  $a_1, \ldots, a_{n_i}$  computed in each batch is obtained via a deterministic algorithm with runtime poly  $(K, d)$ , where  $|\mathcal{A}| = K$ . Hence, the multi-set will be the same in two different executions of the algorithm. On the other hand, the LSE will not be since it depends on the stochastic rewards. We apply the techniques that we developed in the reproducible stochastic MAB setting in order to design our algorithm. Our main result for reproducible  $d$ -dimensional stochastic linear bandits with  $K$  arms follows. For the proof, we refer to Appendix C.

Theorem 6. Let  $T \in \mathbb{N}, \rho \in (0,1]$ . There exists a  $\rho$ -reproducible algorithm for the stochastic  $d$ -dimensional linear bandit problem with  $K$  arms whose expected regret is

$$
\mathbf {E} [ R _ {T} ] \leq C \cdot \frac {K ^ {2}}{\rho^ {2}} \sqrt {d T \log (K T)},
$$

where  $C > 0$  is an absolute numerical constant, and its running time is polynomial in  $d, K, T$  and  $1 / \rho$ .

Note that the best known non-reproducible algorithm achieves an upper bound of  $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{dT\log(K)})$  and, hence, our algorithm incurs a reproducibility overhead of order  $K^2/\rho^2$ . The intuition behind the proof is similar to the multi-armed bandit setting in Section 4.

# 5.2 INFINITE ACTION SET

Let us proceed to the setting where the action set  $\mathcal{A}$  is unbounded. Unfortunately, even when  $d = 1$ , we cannot directly get an algorithm that has satisfactory regret guarantees by discretizing the space and using Algorithm 3. The approach of Esfandiari et al. (2021) is to discretize the action space and use an  $1 / T$ -net to cover it, i.e. a set  $\mathcal{A}' \subseteq A$  such that for all  $a \in \mathcal{A}$  there exists some  $a' \in \mathcal{A}'$  with  $||a - a'||_2 \leq 1 / T$ . It is known that there exists such a net of size at most  $(3T)^d$  (Vershynin, 2018, Corollary 4.2.13). Then, they apply the algorithm for the finite arms setting, increasing their regret guarantee by a factor of  $\sqrt{d}$ . However, our reproducible algorithm for this setting contains an additional factor of  $K^2$  in the regret bound. Thus, even when  $d = 1$ , our regret guarantee is greater than  $T$ , so the bound is vacuous. One way to fix this issue and get a sublinear regret guarantee is to use a smaller net. We use a  $1 / T^{1 / (4d + 2)}$ -net that has size at most  $(3T)^{\frac{d}{4d + 2}}$  and this yields an expected regret of order  $O(T^{4d + 1 / (4d + 2)}\sqrt{d\log(T)} / \rho^2)$ . For further details, we refer to Appendix D.

Even though the regret guarantee we managed to get using the smaller net of Appendix D is sublinear in  $T$ , it is not a satisfactory bound. The next step is to provide an algorithm for the infinite action setting using a reproducible LSE subroutine combined with the batching approach of Esfandiari et al. (2021). We will make use of the next lemma.

Lemma 7 (Section 21.2 Note 3 of Lattimore & Szepesvári (2020)). There exists a deterministic algorithm that, given an action space  $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ , computes a 2-approximate  $G$ -optimal design  $\pi$  with a core set of size  $O(d \log \log(d))$ .

We additionally prove the next useful lemma, which, essentially, states that we can assume without loss of generality that every arm in the support of  $\pi$  has mass at least  $\Omega(1/(d\log(d)))$ . We refer to Appendix F.1 for the proof.

Lemma 8 (Effective Support). Let  $\pi$  be the distribution that corresponds to the 2-approximate optimal  $G$ -design of Lemma 7 with input  $\mathcal{A}$ . Assume that  $\pi(a) \leq c / (d\log(d))$ , where  $c > 0$  is some absolute numerical constant, for some arm  $a$  in the core set. Then, we can construct a distribution  $\widehat{\pi}$  such that, for any arm  $a$  in the core set,  $\widehat{\pi}(a) \geq C / (d\log(d))$ , where  $C > 0$  is an absolute constant, so that it holds

$$
\sup  _ {a ^ {\prime} \in \mathcal {A}} \| a ^ {\prime} \| _ {V (\widehat {\pi}) ^ {- 1}} ^ {2} \leq 4 d.
$$

The upcoming lemma is a reproducible algorithm for the least-squares estimator and, essentially, builds upon Lemma 7 and Lemma 8. Its proof can be found at Appendix F.2.

Lemma 9 (Reproducible LSE). Let  $\rho, \varepsilon \in (0,1]$  and  $0 < \delta \leq \min\{\rho, 1 / d\}^1$ . Consider an environment of  $d$ -dimensional stochastic linear bandits with infinite action space  $\mathcal{A}$ . Assume that  $\pi$  is a 4-approximate optimal design with associated core set  $\mathcal{C}$  as computed by Lemma 7 with input  $\mathcal{A}$ . There exists a  $\rho$ -reproducible algorithm that pulls each arm  $a \in \mathcal{C}$  a total of

$$
\Omega \left(\frac {d ^ {4} \log (d / \delta) \log^ {2} \log (d) \log \log \log (d)}{\varepsilon^ {2} \rho^ {2}}\right)
$$

times and outputs an estimate  $\theta_{\mathrm{SQ}}$  that satisfies  $\sup_{a\in \mathcal{A}}|\langle a,\theta_{\mathrm{SQ}} - \theta^{\star}\rangle |\leq \varepsilon$ , with probability at least  $1 - \delta$ .

The main result for the infinite actions' case, obtained by Algorithm 4, follows. Its proof can be found at Appendix E.

Algorithm 4 Reproducible LSE Algorithm for Stochastic Infinite Action Set (Theorem 10)  
1: Input: time horizon  $T$ , action set  $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ , reproducibility  $\rho$   
2:  $\mathcal{A}' \gets 1/T$ -net of  $\mathcal{A}$   
3: Initialization:  $r \gets T, B \gets \log(T), q \gets (T/c)^{1/B}$   
4: for  $i = 1$  to  $B - 1$  do  
5:  $q^i$  denotes the number of pulls of all arms before the reproducibility blow-up  
6:  $\varepsilon_i = c \cdot d\sqrt{\log(T)/q^i}$   
7: The blow-up is  $M_i = q^i \cdot d^3\log(d)\log^2\log(d)\log\log(d)\log^2(T)/\rho^2$   
8:  $a_1, \ldots, a_{|\mathcal{C}_i|} \gets$  core set  $\mathcal{C}_i$  of the design given by Lemma 7 with parameter  $\mathcal{A}'$

12:  $S_i = \{(a_j, r_t^{(j)}): t \in [N_i], j \in [|\mathcal{C}_i|]\}$   
13:  $\widehat{\theta}_i \gets$  ReproducibleLSE $(S_i, \rho' = \rho/(dB), \delta = 1/(2|\mathcal{A}'|T^2), \tau = \min\{\varepsilon_i, 1\})$   
14:  $r \gets r - [M_i]$   
15: for  $a \in \mathcal{A}'$  do  
16: if  $\langle a, \widehat{\theta}_i \rangle < \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}'} \langle a, \widehat{\theta}_i \rangle - 2\varepsilon_i$  then  
17: Remove  $a$  from  $\mathcal{A}'$   
18: In the last batch play arg max $a \in \mathcal{A}'\langle a, \widehat{\theta}_{B-1} \rangle$   
19:  
20: ReproducibleLSE $(S, \rho, \delta, \tau)$   
21: for  $a \in \mathcal{C}$  do  
22:  $v(a) \gets$  ReproducibleSQ $(\phi : x \in \mathbb{R} \mapsto x \in \mathbb{R}, S, \rho, \delta, \tau)$   
23: return  $(\sum_{j \in |S|} a_j a_j^\top)^{-1} \cdot (\sum_{a \in \mathcal{C}} a_n v(a))$

Theorem 10. Let  $T \in \mathbb{N}$ ,  $\rho \in (0,1]$ . There exists a  $\rho$ -reproducible algorithm (Algorithm 4) for the stochastic  $d$ -dimensional linear bandit problem with infinite action set whose expected regret is

$$
\mathbf {E} [ R _ {T} ] \leq C \cdot \frac {d ^ {4} \log (d) \log^ {2} \log (d) \log \log \log (d)}{\rho^ {2}} \sqrt {T} \log^ {3 / 2} (T),
$$

where  $C > 0$  is an absolute numerical constant, and its running time is polynomial in  $T^d$  and  $1 / \rho$ .

Our algorithm for the infinite arm linear bandit case enjoys an expected regret of order  $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d)\sqrt{T})$ . We underline that the dependence of the regret on the time horizon is (almost) optimal, and we incur an extra  $d^3$  factor in the regret guarantee compared to the non-reproducible algorithm of Esfandiari et al. (2021). We now comment on the time complexity of our algorithm.

Remark 11. The current implementation of our algorithm requires time exponential in  $d$ . However, for a general convex set  $\mathcal{A}$ , given access to a separation oracle for it and an oracle that computes an (approximate)  $G$ -optimal design, we can execute it in polynomial time and with polynomially many calls to the oracle. Notably, when  $\mathcal{A}$  is a polytope such oracles exist. We underline that computational complexity issues also arise in the traditional setting of linear bandits with an infinite number of arms and the computational overhead that the reproducibility requirement adds is minimal. For further details, we refer to Appendix  $G$ .

# 6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In this paper, we have provided a formal notion of reproducibility for stochastic bandits and we have developed algorithms for the multi-armed bandit and the linear bandit settings that satisfy this notion and enjoy a small regret decay compared to their non-reproducible counterparts. An immediate future direction would be to find the optimal dependence on the number of arms  $K$  and the dimension  $d$ . Notice that the dependence on  $\rho$  is optimal, and this follows from the lower bound in Impagliazzo et al. (2022). Our ideas can be applied to more complicated settings, like misspecified linear bandits (Ghosh et al., 2017), and give similar results. We hope and believe that our paper will inspire future works in reproducible interactive learning algorithms.
