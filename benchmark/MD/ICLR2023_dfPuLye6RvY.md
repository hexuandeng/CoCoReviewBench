# ABSTRACT

Unsupervised visual representation learning offers the opportunity to leverage large corpora of unlabeled trajectories to form useful visual representations, which can benefit the training of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, evaluating the fitness of such representations requires training RL algorithms which is computationally intensive and has high variance outcomes. To alleviate this issue, we design an evaluation protocol for unsupervised RL representations with lower variance and up to 600x lower computational cost. Inspired by the vision community, we propose two linear probing tasks: predicting the reward observed in a given state, and predicting the action of an expert in a given state. These two tasks are generally applicable to many RL domains, and we show through rigorous experimentation that they correlate strongly with the actual downstream control performance on the Atari100k Benchmark. This provides a better method for exploring the space of pretraining algorithms without the need of running RL evaluations for every setting. Leveraging this framework, we further improve existing self-supervised learning (SSL) recipes for RL, highlighting the importance of the forward model, the size of the visual backbone, and the precise formulation of the unsupervised objective. Code will be released upon acceptance.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Learning visual representations is a critical step towards solving many kinds of tasks, from supervised tasks such as image classification or object detection, to reinforcement learning (RL). Ever since the early successes of deep reinforcement learning (Mnih et al., 2015), neural networks have been widely adopted to solve pixel-based reinforcement learning tasks such as arcade games (Bellemare et al., 2013), physical continuous control (Todorov et al., 2012; Tassa et al., 2018), and complex video games (Synnaeve et al., 2018; Oh et al., 2016). However, learning deep representations directly from rewards is a challenging task, since this learning signal is often noisy, sparse and delayed.

With ongoing progress in unsupervised visual representation learning for vision tasks (Zbontar et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020a;b; Grill et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2020; 2021), recent efforts have likewise applied self-supervised techniques and ideas to improve representation learning for RL. Some promising approaches include supplementing the RL loss with self-supervised objectives (Laskin et al., 2020; Schwarzer et al., 2021a), or first pre-training the representations on a corpus of trajectories (Schwarzer et al., 2021b; Stooke et al., 2021). However, the diversity in the settings considered, as well as the self-supervised methods used, make it difficult to identify the core principles of successful self-supervised methods in RL. Moreover, estimating the performance of RL algorithms is notoriously challenging (Henderson et al., 2018; Agarwal et al., 2021): it often requires repeating the same experience with a different random seed, and the high CPU-to-GPU ratio is a compute requirement of most online RL methods that is inefficient for typical research compute clusters.. This hinders systematic exploration of the many design choices that characterize SSL methods.

In this paper, we strive to provide a reliable and lightweight evaluation scheme for unsupervised visual representation in the context of RL. Inspired by the vision community, we propose to evaluate the representations using linear probing, by training a linear prediction head on top of frozen features. We devise two probing tasks that we deem widely applicable: predicting the reward in a given state, and predicting the action that would be taken by a fixed policy in a given state (for example that of an expert). We stress that these probing tasks are only used as a means of evaluation. Because

Figure 1: Left: Correlation between the SSL representations' abilities to linearly predict the presence of reward in a given state, versus RL performance using the same representations, measured as the interquartile mean of the human-normalized score (HNS) over 9 Atari games. Each point denotes a separate SSL pretraining method. A linear line of best fit is shown with 95 confidence interval. We compute Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Spearman's r) and determine its statistical significance using permutation testing (with  $n = 50000$ ). Right: When comparing two models, the reward probing score can give low variance reliable estimates of RL performance, while direct RL evaluation may require many seeds to reach meaningful differences in mean performance.

very little supervised data is required, they are particularly suitable for situations where obtaining the expert trajectories or reward labels is expensive. Through thorough experimentation, we show that the performance of the SSL algorithms (in terms of their downstream RL outcomes) correlates with the performance in both probing tasks. This is particularly true for the reward probing task, for which we obtain statistically significant  $(p < 0.001)$  Spearman's rank correlation, making it a particularly effective proxy. Given the vastly reduced computational burden of linear evaluations, we argue that it enables much easier and straightforward experimentation of SSL design choices, paving the way for a more systematic exploration of the design space.

Finally, we leverage this framework to systematically assess some key attributes of SSL methods. First off, we explore the utility and role of learning a forward model as part of the self-supervised objective. We investigate whether its expressiveness matters and show that equipping it with the ability to model uncertainty (through random latent variable) significantly improves the quality of the representations. Next, we identify several knobs in the self-supervised objective, allowing us to carefully tune the parameters in a principled way. Finally, we confirm the previous finding (Schwarzer et al., 2021b) that bigger architectures, when adequately pre-trained, tend to perform better.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

- Design of a rigorous and efficient SSL evaluation protocol in the context of RL  
- Proof that this evaluation scheme correlates with downstream RL performance  
- Systematic exploration of design choices in existing SSL methods.

# 2 RELATED WORK

# 2.1 REPRESENTATION LEARNING

There has recently been a surge in interest and advances in the domain of self-supervised learning in computer vision. Some state-of-art techniques include contrastive learning methods SimCLR, MoCov2 (Chen et al., 2020a;b); clustering methods SwAV (Caron et al., 2020); distillation methods BYOL, SimSiam, OBoW (Grill et al., 2020; Chen and He, 2021; Gidaris et al., 2020); and information maximization methods Barlow Twins and VicReg (Zbontar et al., 2021; Bardes et al., 2021).

These advances have likewise stimulated development in representation learning for reinforcement learning. A line of work includes unsupervised losses as an auxiliary objective during RL training to improve data efficiency. Such objective can be contrastive (Laskin et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020)

or non-contrastive (Schwarzer et al., 2021a; Yu et al., 2022). ST-DIM (Anand et al., 2019), ATC (Stooke et al., 2021) and BVS-DIM (Mengistu et al., 2022) incorporate temporal information in their contrastive objective, adapting similar techniques from the unsupervised video representation learning (Sermanet et al., 2018). Proto-RL (Yarats et al., 2021a) uses a SwAV-like objective to learn representation as well as guide effective exploration during pre-training. Similarly, CRL (Du et al., 2021) trains a policy to optimize a SimCLR loss, then shows transfer to RL, imitation learning and image classification. Closer to our approach, SGI (Schwarzer et al., 2021b) pretrains both an encoder and forward prediction model by minimizing the distance between predictions and target latents using BYOL, and the encoder is recycled during RL for improved data efficiency. While different in spirit, many model based methods also train an encoder from a corpus of trajectory, either by explicit pixel reconstruction Kaiser et al. (2020); Hafner et al. (2021) or in embedding space Ye et al. (2021); Schrittwieser et al. (2020). Self-supervised representations have also been used for imitation learning (Aytar et al., 2018; Pari et al., 2021) as well as exploration (Burda et al., 2019a).

# 2.2 REPRESENTATION PROBING IN REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

Some prior work (Racah and Pal, 2019; Guo et al., 2018; Anand et al., 2019) evaluate the quality of their pretrained representations by probing for ground truth state variables such as agent/object locations and game scores. Das et al. (2020) propose to probe representations with natural language question-answering. Despite the efficiency of these probing methods, their designs are highly domain-specific and require careful handcrafting for each environment. In addition, they fail to demonstrate the actual correlation between probing and RL performances, which makes their practical usefulness uncertain. On the other hand, the authors of ATC (Stooke et al., 2021) propose to evaluate representations by finetuning for RL tasks using the pretrained encoder with weights frozen. Similarly, Laskin et al. (2021) propose a unified benchmark for SSL methods in continuous control but still require full RL training. A part of our work seeks to bridge these two approaches by making explicit the correlation between linear probing and RL performances, as well as designing probing tasks that are generalizable across environments.

# 3 A FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATIONS FOR RL

In this section, we detail our proposed framework for training and evaluating unsupervised representations for reinforcement learning.

# 3.1 UNSUPERVISED PRE-TRAINING

The network is first pre-trained on a large corpus of trajectories. Formally, we define a trajectory  $\mathcal{T}_i$  of length  $T_{i}$  as a sequence of tuples  $\mathcal{T}_i = [(o_t,a_t)\mid t\in [1,T_i]]$ , where  $o_t$  is the observation of the state at time  $t$  in the environment and  $a_{t}$  was the action taken in this state. This setting is closely related to Batch RL (Lange et al., 2012), with the crucial difference that the reward is not being observed. In particular, it should be possible to use the learned representations to maximize any reward (Touati and Ollivier, 2021). The training corpus corresponds to a set of such trajectories:  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{unsup}}\{\mathcal{T}_1,\dots ,\mathcal{T}_n\}$ . We note that the policy used to generate this data is left unspecified in this formulation, and is bound to be environment-specific. Since unsupervised methods usually necessitate a lot of data, this pre-training corpus is required to be substantial. In some domains, it might be straightforward to collect a large number of random trajectories to constitute  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{unsup}}$ . In some other cases, like self-driving, where generating random trajectories is undesirable, expert trajectories from humans can be used instead.

The goal of the pre-training step is to learn the parameters  $\theta$  of an encoder  $\mathrm{ENC}_{\theta}$  which maps any observation  $o$  of the state  $s$  (for example raw pixels) to a representation  $e = \mathrm{ENC}_{\theta}(o)$ . This representation must be amenable for the downstream control task, for example learning a policy.

# 3.2 EVALUATION

In general, the evaluation of RL algorithms is tricky due to the high variance in performance (Henderson et al., 2018). This requires evaluating many random seeds, which creates a computational

burden. We side-step this issue by formulating an evaluation protocol which is light-weight and purely supervised. Specifically, we identify two proxy supervised tasks that are broadly applicable and relevant for control. We further show in the experiment section that they are sound, in the sense that models' performance on the proxy tasks strongly correlates with their performance in the downstream control task of interest. Similar to the evaluation protocol typically used for computer vision models, we rely on linear probing, meaning that we train only a linear layer on top of the representations, which are kept frozen.

Reward Probing Our first task consists in predicting the reward observed in a given state. For this task, we require a corpus of trajectories  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{rew}} = \{\mathcal{T}'_1,\dots ,\mathcal{T}'_m\}$  for which the observed rewards are known, i.e.  $\mathcal{T}'_i = [(o_t,a_t,r_t)\mid t\in [1,T_i]]$

In the most general setting, it can be formulated as a regression problem, where the goal is to minimize the following loss:

$$
\mathcal {L} (\psi) _ {\mathrm {r e w a r d - r e g}} = \frac {1}{| \mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {r e w}} |} \sum_ {\mathcal {T} ^ {\prime} _ {i} \in \mathcal {D} _ {\mathrm {r e w}}} \frac {1}{| \mathcal {T} ^ {\prime} _ {i} |} \sum_ {\left(o _ {t}, a _ {t}, r _ {t} \in \mathcal {T} ^ {\prime} _ {i}\right)} \| l _ {\psi} (\mathrm {E N C} _ {\theta} (o _ {t})) - r _ {t} \| _ {2}
$$

Here, the only learnt parameters  $\psi$  are those of the linear prediction layer  $l_{\psi}$ .

In practice, in many environments where rewards are sparse, the presence or absence of a reward is more important than its magnitude. To simplify the problem in those cases, we can cast it as a binary prediction problem instead (this could be extended to ternary classification if the sign of the reward is of interest):

$$
\mathcal {L} (\psi) _ {\text {r e w a r d - c l a s s i f}} = \frac {1}{| \mathcal {D} _ {\text {r e w}} |} \sum_ {\mathcal {T} ^ {\prime} _ {i} \in \mathcal {D} _ {\text {r e w}}} \frac {1}{| \mathcal {T} ^ {\prime} _ {i} |} \sum_ {(o _ {t}, a _ {t}, r _ {t} \in \mathcal {T} ^ {\prime} _ {i})} \operatorname {B i n a r y C E} \left(\mathbb {1} _ {\mathbb {R} > 0} (r _ {t}), l _ {\psi} \left(\operatorname {E N C} _ {\theta} (o _ {t})\right)\right)
$$

Reward prediction is closely related to value prediction, a central objective in RL that is essential for value-based control and the critic in actor-critic methods. The ability to predict instantaneous reward, akin to predicting value with a very small discount factor, can be viewed as a lower bound on the learned representation's ability to encode the value function, and has been demonstrably helpful for control, particularly in sparse reward tasks (Jaderberg et al., 2017). Thus, we hypothesize reward prediction accuracy to be a good probing proxy task for our setting as well.

Action prediction Our second task consists in predicting the action taken by an expert in a given state. For this task, we require a corpus of trajectories  $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{exp}} = \{\mathcal{T}_1,\dots ,\mathcal{T}_n\}$  generated by an expert policy. We stress that this dataset may be much smaller than the pretraining corpus since we only require to fit and evaluate a linear model. The corresponding objective is as follows:

$$
\mathcal {L} (\psi) _ {\text {a c t i o n - c l a s s i f}} = \frac {1}{| \mathcal {D} _ {\text {e x p}} |} \sum_ {\mathcal {T} _ {i} \in \mathcal {D} _ {\text {e x p}}} \frac {1}{| \mathcal {T} _ {i} |} \sum_ {\left(o _ {t}, a _ {t} \in \mathcal {T} ^ {\prime} _ {i}\right)} \operatorname {C r o s s E n t r o p y} \left(a _ {t}, l _ {\psi} \left(\operatorname {E N C} _ {\theta} \left(o _ {t}\right)\right)\right)
$$

This task is closely related to imitation learning, however, we are not concerned with the performance of the policy that we learn as a by-product.

# 4 SELF PREDICTIVE REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR RL

In our work, we focus on evaluating and improving a particular class of unsupervised pretraining algorithms that involves using a transition model to predict its own representations in the future (Schwarzer et al., 2021b; Guo et al., 2018; Gelada et al., 2019). This pretraining modality is especially well suited for RL, since the transition model can be conditioned on agent actions, and can be repurposed for model-based RL after pretraining. Our framework is depicted in Fig.2. In this section, we present the main design choices, and we investigate their performance in Section 5.

# 4.1 TRANSITION MODELS

Our baseline transition model is a 2D convolutional network applied directly to the spatial output of the convolutional encoder (Schwarzer et al., 2021b; Schrittwieser et al., 2020). The network consists

![](images/3eef02d2f60d718e8990f6716b96bd66f4e58f5566b2f68edebcb3e95f3db82a.jpg)  
Figure 2: Model diagram. The observations consist of a stack of 4 frames, to which we apply data augmentation before passing them to a convolutional encoder. The predictor is a recurrent model outputting future state embeddings given the action. We supervise with an inverse modeling loss (cross entropy loss on the predicted transition action) and an SSL loss (distance between embeddings)

of two 64-channel convolutional layers with  $3 \times 3$  filters. The action is represented as a 2D one-hot vector and appended to the input to the first convolutional layer.

We believe a well-established sequence modeling architecture such as GRU can serve as a superior transition model. Its gating mechanisms should be better at retaining information from both the immediate and distant past, especially helpful for learning dynamics in a partially observable environment.

$$
\operatorname {E n c o d e r}: \quad \hat {e _ {0}} = e _ {0} = \operatorname {E N C} _ {\theta} (o _ {0})
$$

$$
\text {R e c u r r e n t M o d e l}: \quad \hat {e} _ {t} = f _ {\phi} (\hat {e} _ {t - 1}, a _ {t - 1})
$$

In addition to the deterministic GRU model above, we also experiment with a GRU variant where we introduce stochastic states to allow our model to generalize better to stochastic environments, such as Atari with sticky actions (Machado et al., 2018). Our model is based on the RSSM from DreamerV2 (Hafner et al., 2021), with the main difference being that while pixel reconstruction is used as the SSL objective in the original work, we minimize the distance between predictions and targets purely in the latent space. Following DreamerV2, we optimize the latent variables using straight-through gradients (Bengio et al., 2013), and minimize the distance between posterior  $(z)$  and prior  $(\hat{z})$  distributions using KL loss.

$$
\operatorname {E n c o d e r}: \quad e _ {t} = \operatorname {E N C} _ {\theta} (o _ {t})
$$

$$
\text {R e c u r r e n t M o d e l}: \quad h _ {t} = f _ {\phi} \left(h _ {t - 1}, z _ {t - 1}, a _ {t - 1}\right)
$$

$$
\text {P o s t e r i o r M o d e l}: \quad z _ {t} \sim p _ {\phi} \left(z _ {t} \mid h _ {t}, e _ {t}\right)
$$

$$
\text {P r i o r P r e d i c t o r}: \quad \hat {z} _ {t} \sim j _ {\phi} (\hat {z} _ {t} | h _ {t})
$$

$$
\text {L a t e n t M e r g e r}: \quad \hat {e} _ {t} = g _ {\phi} \left(h _ {t}, z _ {t}\right)
$$

# 4.2 PREDICTION OBJECTIVES

The objective of self-predictive representation learning is to minimize the distance between the predicted and the target representations, while ensuring that they do not collapse to a trivial solution. Our baseline prediction objective is BYOL (Grill et al., 2020), which is also used in SGI (Schwarzer et al., 2021b). The predicted representation  $\hat{e}_{t+k}$ , and the encoded target representation  $\tilde{e}_{t+k}$  are first projected to lower dimensions to produce  $\hat{y}_{t+k}$  and  $\tilde{y}_{t+k}$ . BYOL then maximizes the cosine similarity between the predicted and target projections, using a linear prediction function  $q$  to translate from  $\hat{y}$  to  $\tilde{y}$ :

$$
L _ {\theta} ^ {B Y O L} (\hat {y} _ {t: t + k}, \tilde {y} _ {t: t + k}) = - \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \frac {q (\hat {y} _ {t + k}) \cdot \tilde {y} _ {t + k}}{\| q (\hat {y} _ {t + k}) \| _ {2} \cdot \| \tilde {y} _ {t + k} \| _ {2}}
$$

In the case of BYOL, the target encoder and projection module are the exponentially moving average of the online weights, and the gradients are blocked on the target branch.

As an alternative prediction objective, we experiment with Barlow Twins (Zbontar et al., 2021). Similar to BYOL, Barlow Twins minimizes the distance of the latent representations between the online and target branches; however, instead of using a predictor module and stop gradient on the target branch, Barlow Twins avoids collapse by pushing the cross-correlation matrix between the projection outputs on the two branches to be as close to the identity matrix as possible. To adapt Barlow Twins, we calculate the cross correlation across batch and time dimensions:

$$
L ^ {B T} (\hat {y} _ {t: t + k}, \tilde {y} _ {t: t + k}) = \sum_ {i} (1 - C _ {i i}) ^ {2} + \lambda \sum_ {i, j \neq i} C _ {i j} ^ {2} \mathrm {w h e r e} C _ {i j} = \frac {\sum_ {b , t} (\hat {y} _ {b , t , i}) \cdot (\tilde {y} _ {b , t , j})}{\sqrt {\sum_ {b , t} (\hat {y} _ {b , t , i}) ^ {2}} \cdot \sqrt {\sum_ {b , t} (\tilde {y} _ {b , t , j}) ^ {2}}}
$$

where  $\lambda$  is a positive constant trading off the importance of the invariance and covariance terms of the loss,  $C$  is the cross-correlation matrix computed between the projection outputs of two branches along the batch and time dimensions,  $b$  indexes batch samples,  $t$  indexes time, and  $i,j$  index the vector dimension of the projection output.

By enabling gradients on both the prediction and target branches, the Barlow objective pushes the predictions towards the representations, while regularizing the representations toward the predictions. In practice, learning the transition model takes time and we want to avoid regularizing the representations towards poorly trained predictions. To address this, we apply a higher learning rate to the prediction branch. We call this technique Barlow Balancing, and implement it in Algorithm 1.

# Algorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for Barlow Balancing

$$
\mathrm {B a r l o w L o s s} = \mu * L ^ {B T} (\hat {y}, \tilde {y}. \mathrm {d e t a c h ()}) + (1 - \mu) * L ^ {B T} (\hat {y}. \mathrm {d e t a c h (), \tilde {y}})
$$

# 4.3 OTHER SSL OBJECTIVES

SGI's authors (Schwarzer et al., 2021b) showed that in the absence of other SSL objectives, pretraining with BYOL prediction objective alone results in representation collapse; the addition of inverse dynamics modeling loss is necessary to prevent collapse, while the addition of goal-oriented RL loss results in minor downstream RL performance improvement. In inverse dynamics modeling, the model is trained using cross-entropy to model  $p(a_{t}|\hat{y}_{t + k},\tilde{y}_{t + k + 1})$ , effectively predicting the transition action between two adjacent states. For details regarding goal-oriented RL loss, please refer to Appendix.

# 5 RESULTS

# 5.1 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

We conduct experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment benchmark (Bellemare et al., 2013). Given the multitude of pretraining setups we investigate, we limit our experiment to 9 Atari games<sup>1</sup>.

Pretraining We use the publicly-available DQN replay dataset (Agarwal et al., 2020), which contains data from training a DQN agent for 50M steps with sticky action (Machado et al., 2018). We select 1.5 million frames from the 3.5 to 5 millionth steps of the replay dataset, which constitutes trajectories of a weak, partially trained agent. We largely follow the recipe of SGI (Schwarzer et al., 2021b), where we jointly optimize the self prediction, goal-conditioned RL, and inverse dynamics modeling losses for 20 epochs; in some of our experiments we remove one or both of the last two objectives.

![](images/fb44f7b7ba742e6238d597c81043b4d07d9b6a61f4df543f49c1466106d1db06.jpg)  
Figure 3: Decoding results, using a de-convolutional model to predict the pixel values from frozen state representations. Both games exhibit stochastic behaviours. In Demon attack, both models fail to capture the position of the enemies. In Gopher, the enemy (circled in red) is moving randomly, but thanks to the latent variable, the GRU-latent model is able to predict a possible position, while the deterministic model regresses to the mean.

We use the same data-augmentations as SGI, namely the ones introduced by Yarats et al. (2021b). All experiments are performed on single instances of MI50 AMD GPU, and the pretraining process took 2 to 8 days depending on the model.

Reward probing We focus on the simplified binary classification task of whether a reward occurs in a given state. We use 100k frames from the 1-1.1 millionth step of the replay dataset, with a 4:1 train/eval split. We train a logistic regression model on frozen features using the Cyanure (Mairal, 2019) library, with the MISO algorithm (Mairal, 2015) coupled with QNING acceleration (Lin et al., 2019) for a maximum of 300 steps. We do not use any data augmentation. We report the mean F1 averaged across all 9 games. On a MI50 AMD GPU, each probing run takes 10 minutes.

Action probing We use the last 100k (4:1 train/eval split) frames of the DQN replay dataset, which correspond to a fully trained DQN agent. We train a linear layer on top of frozen, un-augmented features for 12 epochs with softmax focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) using SGD optimizer with learning rate 0.2, batch size 256, 1e-6 weight decay, stepwise scheduler with step size 10 and gamma 0.1. We report the Multiclass F1 (weighted average of F1 scores of each class) averaged across all games.

RL evaluation We focus on the Atari 100k benchmark (Kaiser et al., 2020), where only 100k interactive steps are allowed by the agent. This is roughly equivalent to two hours of human play, providing an approximation for human level sample-efficiency. We follow Schwarzer et al. (2021b) training protocol using the Rainbow algorithm (Hessel et al., 2018) with the following differences: we freeze the pretrained encoder (thus only training the Q head), do not apply auxiliary SSL losses while fine-tuning, and finally disable noisy layers and rely instead on  $\epsilon$ -greedy exploration. This changes are made to make the RL results reflect as closely as possible the performance induced by the quality of the representations. On a MI50 AMD GPU, each run takes between 8 and 12 hours.

We evaluate the agent's performance using human-normalized score (HNS), defined as (agentscore-randomscore)/(humanscore-randomscore). We calculate this per game, per seed by averaging scores over 100 evaluation trajectories at the end of training. For aggregate metrics across games and seeds, we report the median and interquartile mean (IQM). For median, we first average the HNS across seeds for each game, and report the median of the averaged HNS values. For IQM, we first take the middle  $50\%$  of scores across both seeds and games, then report the average. While median is commonly reported for Atari100k, recent work has recommended IQM as a superior aggregate metric for the RL setting due to its smaller uncertainty (Agarwal et al., 2021); we also follow the cited work to report the  $95\%$  bootstrapped confidence intervals for these aggregate metrics.

Unless specified otherwise, the experiments use the medium ResNet-M from Schwarzer et al. (2021b), and the inverse dynamics loss as an auxiliary loss. In BYOL experiments, the target network is an exponential moving average of the online network, while in Barlow Twins both networks are identical, following the original papers. For additional details regarding model architectures and hyperparameters used during pretraining and RL evaluation, please refer to Appendix.

In table 1, we report the mean probing F1 scores for the convolutional, deterministic GRU, and latent GRU transition models trained using either the BYOL or Barlow prediction objective. When using the BYOL objective, the relative probing strengths for the different transition models are somewhat ambiguous: while the convolutional model results in better reward probing F1, the GRU models are superior in terms of expert action probing.

Interestingly, we observe that after replacing BYOL with Barlow, the probing scores for the latent model improve, while those of the deterministic models deteriorate. Overall, the particular combination of pre-training using the GRU-latent transition model with the Barlow prediction objective results in representations with the best overall probing qualities. Since the deterministic model's predictions are likely to regress to the mean, allowing gradients to flow through the target branch in the case of Barlow objective can regularize the representations towards poor predictions, and can explain their inferior probing performance. Introducing latent variables can alleviate this issue through better predictions.

We stress that the transition models are not used during probing, only the encoder is. These experiments show that having a more expressive forward model during the pre-training has a direct impact on the quality of the representations learned by the encoder. In Fig.3, we qualitatively investigate the impact of the latent variable on the information contained in the representations, by training a decoder on frozen features.

In table 2, we show the results from experimenting with different variants of the Barlow objective. We find that using a higher learning rate for the prediction branch  $(\text{Barlow}_{0.7}$ , with 7:3 prediction to target lr ratio) results in better probing outcome than using equal learning rates  $(\text{Barlow}_{0.5})$  or not letting gradients flow in the target branch altogether  $(\text{Barlow}_1$ , here the target encoder is a copy of the online encoder). This suggests that while it is helpful to regularize the representations towards the predictions, there is a potential for them being regularized towards poorly trained ones. This can be addressed by applying a higher learning rate on the prediction branch.

We also demonstrate that using a frozen, random target network (Barlow<sub>rand</sub>) results in good features, and in our experiments it gets the best reward probing performance. This contradicts findings from the vision domain (Grill et al., 2020), but corroborates self-supervised results from other domains such as speech (Chiu et al., 2022). Random networks have also been shown to exhibit useful inductive biases

for exploration (Burda et al., 2019b;a). An explanation is that random targets act as a regularization that prevent partial collapse by enforcing a wide range of features to be encoded by the model.

SSL objective Although pretraining with multiple objectives can sometimes result in better downstream performance, in practice they also make it harder to tune for hyperparameters and debug, therefore it is desirable to use the least number of objectives that can result in comparable performance.

In table 4, we show the effects of inverse dynamics modeling (inv) and goal-conditioned RL (goal) objectives on probing performance. The BYOL model experiences partial collapse without the inverse dynamics modeling loss, while the addition of goal loss improves the probing performance slightly. This is in congruence with the relative RL performances reported by SGI (Schwarzer et al., 2021b) for the same ablations.

The Barlow-only model performs significantly better than the BYOL-only model in terms of probing scores, indicating that the Barlow objective is less prone to collapse in the predictive SSL setting. Similar to the BYOL model, the Barlow model can also be improved with inverse dynamics modeling, while the addition of goal loss has a slight negative impact.

Encoders SGI (Schwarzer et al., 2021b) showed that using bigger encoders during pretraining results in improved downstream RL performance. We revisit this topic from the point of finding out whether the pretrained representations from bigger networks also have better probing qualities. We experiment with the medium (ResNet-M) and large (ResNet-L) residual networks from SGI. In table 5 we show that Barlow models pretrained using the larger ResNet have improved probing scores, which is consistent with SGI's findings.

# 5.4 CORRELATIONS BETWEEN PROBING AND RL PERFORMANCES

If our goal is to use linear probing as a guide to identify superior pretraining setup for RL, then they are only useful to the extent to which they correlate with the actual downstream RL performance. We perform RL evaluations for 7 representative setups, and report their probing and aggregate RL metrics in table 3, with the confidence intervals of the aggregate RL metrics depicted on the right. We find that the rank correlations between reward probing F1 and the RL aggregate metrics are significant (Figure 1), while those for the expert action probing F1 are weaker, though still positive (0.57 for  $\mathrm{RL}_{\mathrm{md}}$  and 0.39 for  $\mathrm{RL}_{\mathrm{iqm}}$ ). In sum, our results show that reward probing is a reliable guide for designing pretraining setups that deliver significant downstream RL performance improvements.

# 6 CONCLUSION

In this paper we have investigated the opportunity to replace costly RL evaluation with lightweight linear probing task to assess the quality of learned representations. Using this methodology to guide us, we have demonstrated the impact of a number of key design choices in the pre-training methodology. We hope that these results encourage the research community to systematically explore the design space to further improve the quality of self-supervised representations for RL.
