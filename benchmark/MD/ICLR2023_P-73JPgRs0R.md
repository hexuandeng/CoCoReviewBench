# ABSTRACT

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are one of the most popular architectures that are used to solve classification problems accompanied by graphical information. We present a rigorous theoretical understanding of the effects of graph convolutions in multi-layer networks. We study these effects through the node classification problem of a non-linearly separable Gaussian mixture model coupled with a stochastic block model. First, we show that a single graph convolution expands the regime of the distance between the means where multi-layer networks can classify the data by a factor of at least  $1 / \sqrt[4]{\deg}$ , where  $\deg$  denotes the expected degree of a node. Second, we show that with a slightly stronger graph density, two graph convolutions improve this factor to at least  $1 / \sqrt[4]{n}$ , where  $n$  is the number of nodes in the graph. Finally, we provide both theoretical and empirical insights into the performance of graph convolutions placed in different combinations among the layers of a neural network, concluding that the performance is mutually similar for all combinations of the placement. We present extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data that illustrate our results.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A large amount of interesting data and the practical challenges associated with them are defined in the setting where entities have attributes as well as information about mutual relationships. Traditional classification models have been extended to capture such relational information through graphs (Hamilton, 2020), where each node has individual attributes and the edges of the graph capture the relationships among the nodes. A variety of applications characterized by this type of graph-structured data include works in the areas of social analysis (Backstrom & Leskovec, 2011), recommendation systems (Ying et al., 2018), computer vision (Monti et al., 2017), study of the properties of chemical compounds (Gilmer et al., 2017; Scarselli et al., 2009), statistical physics (Bapst et al., 2020; Battaglia et al., 2016), and financial forensics (Zhang et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2019).

The most popular learning models for relational data use graph convolutions (Kipf & Welling, 2017), where the idea is to aggregate the attributes of the set of neighbours of a node instead of only utilizing its own attributes. Despite several empirical studies of various GCN-type models (Chen et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2022) that demonstrate that graph convolutions can improve the performance of traditional classification methods, such as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), there has been limited progress in the theoretical understanding of the benefits of graph convolutions in multi-layer networks in terms of improving node classification tasks.

Related work. The capacity of a graph convolution for one-layer networks is studied in Baranwal et al. (2021), along with its out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization potential. A more recent work (Wu et al., 2022) formulates the node-level OoD problem, and develops a learning method that facilitates GNNs to leverage invariance principles for prediction. In Gasteiger et al. (2019), the authors utilize a propagation scheme based on personalized PageRank to construct a model that outperforms several GCN-like methods for semi-supervised classification. Through their algorithm, APPNP, they show that placing power iterations at the last layer of an MLP achieves state of the art performance. Our results align with this observation.

There exists a large amount of theoretical work on unsupervised learning for random graph models where node features are absent and only relational information is available (Decelle et al., 2011;

Massoulié, 2014; Mossel et al., 2018; 2015; Abbe & Sandon, 2015; Abbe et al., 2015; Bordenave et al., 2015; Deshpande et al., 2015; Montanari & Sen, 2016; Banks et al., 2016; Abbe & Sandon, 2018; Li et al., 2019; Kloumann et al., 2017; Gaudio et al., 2022). For a comprehensive survey, see Abbe (2018); Moore (2017). For data models which have node features coupled with relational information, several works have studied the semi-supervised node classification problem, see, for example, Scarselli et al. (2009); Cheng et al. (2011); Gilbert et al. (2012); Dang & Viennet (2012); Gunnemann et al. (2013); Yang et al. (2013); Hamilton et al. (2017); Jin et al. (2019); Mehta et al. (2019); Chien et al. (2022); Yan et al. (2021). These papers provide good empirical insights into the merits of graph structure in the data. We complement these studies with theoretical results that explain the effects of graph convolutions in a multi-layer network.

In Deshpande et al. (2018); Lu & Sen (2020), the authors explore the fundamental thresholds for the classification of a substantial fraction of the nodes with linear sample complexity and large but finite degree. Another relatively recent work (Hou et al., 2020) proposes two graph smoothness metrics for measuring the benefits of graphical information, along with a new attention-based framework. In Fountoulakis et al. (2022), the authors provide a theoretical study of the graph attention mechanism (GAT) and identify the regimes where the attention mechanism is (or is not) beneficial to node-classification tasks. Our study focuses on convolutions instead of attention-based mechanisms. Several other works study the expressive power and extrapolation of GNNs, along with the oversmoothing phenomenon (see, for e.g., Balcilar et al. (2021); Xu et al. (2021); Oono & Suzuki (2020); Li et al. (2018)), however, our focus is to draw a comparison of the benefits and limitations of graph convolutions with those of a traditional MLP that does not utilize relational information. In our setting, we focus our study on the regimes where oversmoothing does not occur.

To the best of our knowledge, this area of research still lacks theoretical guarantees that explain when and why graphical data, and in particular, graph convolutions, can boost traditional multi-layer networks to perform better on node-classification tasks. To this end, we study the effects of graph convolutions in deeper layers of a multi-layer network. For node classification tasks, we also study whether one can avoid using additional layers in the network design for the sole purpose of gathering information from neighbours that are farther away, by comparing the benefits of placing all convolutions in a single layer versus placing them in different layers.

Our contributions. We study the performance of multi-layer networks for the task of binary node classification on a data model where node features are sampled from a Gaussian mixture, and relational information is sampled from a symmetric two-block stochastic block model<sup>1</sup> (see Section 2.1 for details). The node features are modelled after XOR data with two classes, and therefore, has four distinct components, two for each class. Our choice of the data model is inspired from the fact that it is non-linearly separable. Hence, a single layer network fails to classify the data from this model. Similar data models based on the contextual stochastic block model (CSBM) have been used extensively in the literature, see, for example, Deshpande et al. (2018); Binkiewicz et al. (2017); Chien et al. (2021; 2022); Baranwal et al. (2021). We now summarize our contributions below.

1. We show that when node features are accompanied by a graph, a single graph convolution enables a multi-layer network to classify the nodes in a wider regime as compared to methods that do not utilize the graph, improving the threshold for the distance between the means of the features by a factor of at least  $1 / \sqrt[4]{\mathbb{E}\deg}$ . Furthermore, assuming a slightly denser graph, we show that with two graph convolutions, a multi-layer network can classify the data in an even wider regime, improving the threshold by a factor of at least  $1 / \sqrt[4]{n}$ , where  $n$  is the number of nodes in the graph.  
2. We show that for multi-layer networks equipped with graph convolutions, the classification capacity is determined by the number of graph convolutions rather than the number of layers in the network. In particular, we study the gains obtained by placing graph convolutions in a layer, and compare the benefits of placing all convolutions in a single layer versus placing them in different combinations across different layers. We find that the performance is mutually similar for all combinations with the same number of graph convolutions.

3. We verify our theoretical results through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, showing trends about the performance of graph convolutions in various combinations across multiple layers of a network, and in different regimes of interest.

The rest of our paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide a detailed description of the data model and the network architecture that is central to our study, followed by our analytical results in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 presents extensive experiments that illustrate our theoretical findings.

# 2 PRELIMINARIES

# 2.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA MODEL

Let  $n, d$  be positive integers, where  $n$  denotes the number of data points (sample size) and  $d$  denotes the dimension of the features. Define the Bernoulli random variables  $\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_n \sim \mathrm{Ber}(1/2)$  and  $\eta_1, \ldots, \eta_n \sim \mathrm{Ber}(1/2)$ . Further, define two classes  $C_b = \{i \in [n] \mid \varepsilon_i = b\}$  for  $b \in \{0, 1\}$ .

Let  $\pmb{\mu}$  and  $\pmb{\nu}$  be fixed vectors in  $\mathbb{R}^d$ , such that  $\| \pmb{\mu}\|_2 = \| \pmb{\nu}\|_2$  and  $\langle \pmb{\mu},\pmb{\nu}\rangle = 0$ . Denote by  $\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$  the data matrix where each row-vector  $\mathbf{X}_i\in \mathbb{R}^d$  is an independent Gaussian random vector distributed as  $\mathbf{X}_i\sim \mathcal{N}((2\eta_i - 1)((1 - \varepsilon_i)\pmb {\mu} + \varepsilon_i\pmb {\nu}),\sigma^2)$ . We use the notation  $\mathbf{X}\sim \mathrm{XOR - GMM}(n,d,\pmb {\mu},\pmb {\nu},\sigma^2)$  to refer to data sampled from this model.

Let us now define the model with graphical information. In this case, in addition to the features  $\mathbf{X}$  described above, we have a graph with the adjacency matrix,  $\mathbf{A} = (a_{ij})_{i,j\in [n]}$ , that corresponds to an undirected graph including self-loops, and is sampled from a standard symmetric two-block stochastic block model with parameters  $p$  and  $q$ , where  $p$  is the intra-block and  $q$  is the inter-block edge probability. The  $\mathrm{SBM}(n,p,q)$  is then coupled with the XOR-GMM  $(n,d,\mu ,\nu ,\sigma^2)$  in the way that  $a_{ij}\sim \mathrm{Ber}(p)$  if  $\varepsilon_{i} = \varepsilon_{j}$  and  $a_{ij}\sim \mathrm{Ber}(q)$  if  $\varepsilon_{i}\neq \varepsilon_{j}$ . For data  $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{X}) = (\{a_{ij}\}_{i,j\in [n]},\{\mathbf{X}_i\}_{i\in n})$  sampled from this model, we say  $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{X})\sim \mathrm{XOR - CSBM}(n,d,\mu ,\nu ,\sigma^2,p,q)$ .

We will denote by  $\mathbf{D}$  the diagonal degree matrix of the graph with adjacency matrix  $\mathbf{A}$ , and thus,  $\mathbf{deg}(i) = \mathbf{D}_{ii} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}$  denotes the degree of node  $i$ . We will use  $N_i = \{j \in [n] \mid a_{ij} = 1\}$  to denote the set of neighbours of a node  $i$ . We will also use the notation  $i \sim j$  or  $i \sim j$  throughout the paper to signify, respectively, that  $i$  and  $j$  are in the same class, or in different classes.

# 2.2 NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

Our analysis focuses on MLP architectures with ReLU activations. In particular, for a network with  $L$  layers, we define the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbf {H} ^ {(0)} = \mathbf {X}, \\ \left. \begin{array}{l} f ^ {(l)} (\mathbf {X}) = (\mathbf {D} ^ {- 1} \mathbf {A}) ^ {k _ {l}} \mathbf {H} ^ {(l - 1)} \mathbf {W} ^ {(l)} + \mathbf {b} ^ {(l)} \\ \mathbf {H} ^ {(l)} = \operatorname {R e L U} (f ^ {(l)} (\mathbf {X})) \end{array} \right\} \text {f o r} l \in [ L ], \\ \hat {\mathbf {y}} = \varphi (f ^ {(L)} (\mathbf {X})). \\ \end{array}
$$

Here,  $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$  is the given data, which is an input for the first layer and  $\varphi(x) = \operatorname{sigmoid}(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ , applied element-wise. The final output of the network is represented by  $\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \{\hat{y}_i\}_{i \in [n]}$ . Note that  $\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{A}$  is the normalized adjacency matrix $^3$  and  $k_l$  denotes the number of graph convolutions placed in layer  $l$ . In particular, for a simple MLP with no graphical information, we have  $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}_n$ .

We will denote by  $\theta$ , the set of all weights and biases,  $(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}, \mathbf{b}^{(l)})_{l \in [L]}$ , which are the learnable parameters of the network. For a dataset  $(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y})$ , we denote the binary cross-entropy loss obtained by a multi-layer network with parameters  $\theta$  by  $\ell_{\theta}(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{X}) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in [n]} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)$ ,

and the optimization problem is formulated as

$$
\operatorname {O P T} (\mathbf {A}, \mathbf {X}) = \min  _ {\theta \in \mathcal {C}} \ell_ {\theta} (\mathbf {A}, \mathbf {X}), \tag {1}
$$

where  $\mathcal{C}$  denotes a suitable constraint set for  $\theta$ . For our analyses, we take the constraint set  $\mathcal{C}$  to impose the condition  $\left\| \mathbf{W}^{(1)}\right\|_2 \leq R$  and  $\left\| \mathbf{W}^{(l)}\right\|_2 \leq 1$  for all  $1 < l \leq L$ , i.e., the weight parameters of all layers  $l > 1$  are normalized, while for  $l = 1$ , the norm is bounded by some fixed value  $R$ . This is necessary because without the constraint, the value of the loss function can go arbitrarily close to 0. Furthermore, the parameter  $R$  helps us concisely provide bounds for the loss in our theorems for various regimes by bounding the Lipschitz constant of the learned function. In the rest of our paper, we use  $\ell_{\theta}(\mathbf{X})$  to denote  $\ell_{\theta}(\mathbf{I}_n, \mathbf{X})$ , which is the loss in the absence of graphical information.

# 3 RESULTS

We now describe our theoretical contributions, followed by a discussion and a proof sketch.

# 3.1 SETTING UP THE BASELINE

Before stating our main result about the benefits and performance of graph convolutions, we set up a comparative baseline in the setting where graphical information is absent. In the following theorem, we completely characterize the classification threshold for the XOR-GMM data model in terms of the distance between the means of the mixture model and the number of data points  $n$ . Let  $\Phi(\cdot)$  denote the cumulative distribution function of a standard Gaussian, and  $\Phi_{\mathrm{c}}(\cdot) = 1 - \Phi(\cdot)$ .

Theorem 1. Let  $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} \sim \text{XOR-GMM}(n, d, \pmb{\mu}, \pmb{\nu}, \sigma^2)$ . Then we have the following:

1. Assume that  $\| \pmb{\mu} - \pmb{\nu}\| _2\leq K\sigma$  and let  $h(\mathbf{x}):\mathbb{R}^d\to \{0,1\}$  be any binary classifier. Then for any  $K > 0$  and any  $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ , at least a fraction  $2\Phi_{\mathrm{c}}(K / 2)^{2} - O(n^{-\epsilon /2})$  of all data points are misclassified by  $h$  with probability at least  $1 - \exp (-2n^{1 - \epsilon})$ .  
2. For any  $\epsilon > 0$ , if the distance between the means is  $\| \pmb{\mu} - \pmb{\nu} \|_2 = \Omega (\sigma (\log n)^{\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon})$ , then for any  $c > 0$ , with probability at least  $1 - O(n^{-c})$ , there exist a two-layer and a three-layer network that perfectly classify the data, and obtain a cross-entropy loss given by

$$
\ell_ {\theta} (\mathbf {X}) = C \exp \left(- \frac {R}{\sqrt {2}} \| \boldsymbol {\mu} - \boldsymbol {\nu} \| _ {2} \left(1 \pm \sqrt {c} / (\log n) ^ {\epsilon}\right)\right),
$$

where  $C \in [1/2, 1]$  is an absolute constant and  $R$  is the optimality constraint from Eq. (1).

Part one of Theorem 1 shows that if the means of the features of the two classes are at most  $O(\sigma)$  apart then with overwhelming probability, there is a constant fraction of points that are misclassified. Note that the fraction of misclassified points is  $2\Phi_{\mathrm{c}}(K / 2)^{2}$ , which approaches 0 as  $K \to \infty$  and approaches  $1 / 2$  as  $K \to 0$ , signifying that if the means are very far apart then we successfully classify all data points, while if they coincide then we always misclassify roughly half of all data points. Furthermore, note that if  $K = c\sqrt{\log n}$  for some constant  $c \in [0,1)$ , then the total number of points misclassified is  $2n\Phi_{\mathrm{c}}(K)^{2} \asymp \frac{n}{K^{2}} e^{-K^{2}} \asymp \frac{n^{1 - c^{2}}}{\log n} = \Omega (1)$ . Thus, intuitively,  $K \asymp \sqrt{\log n}$  is the threshold beyond which learning methods are expected to perfectly classify the data. This is formalized in part two of the theorem, which supplements the misclassification result by showing that if the means are roughly  $\omega (\sigma \sqrt{\log n})$  apart then the data is classifiable with overwhelming probability.

# 3.2 IMPROVEMENT THROUGH GRAPH CONVOLUTIONS

We now state the results that explain the effects of graph convolutions in multi-layer networks with the architecture described in Section 2.2. We characterize the improvement in the classification threshold in terms of the distance between the means of the node features. Let  $\operatorname{erf}(t) = 2\Phi(t\sqrt{2}) - 1$  be the Gauss error function and  $\zeta(t) = t\operatorname{erf}(t) - (1 - \exp(-t^2)) / \sqrt{\pi}$ .

Theorem 2. Let  $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{X})\sim XOR-CSBM(n,d,\pmb {\mu},\pmb {\nu},\sigma^2,p,q)$ $\gamma = \| \pmb {\mu} - \pmb {\nu}\| _2$  , and  $\Gamma (p,q) = |p-$ $q| / (p + q)$  . There exist a two-layer network and a three-layer network with the following properties:

- If the intra-class and inter-class edge probabilities are  $p, q = \Omega(\frac{\log^2 n}{n})$ , and it holds that  $\Gamma(p, q) \zeta(\gamma/2\sigma) = \omega \left( \sqrt{\frac{\log n}{n(p + q)}} \right)$ , then for any  $c > 0$ , with probability at least  $1 - O(n^{-c})$ , the networks equipped with a graph convolution in the second or the third layer perfectly classify the data, and obtain the following loss:

$$
\ell_ {\theta} (\mathbf {A}, \mathbf {X}) = C ^ {\prime} \exp \left(- C \sigma R \Gamma (p, q) \zeta (\gamma / 2 \sigma) \left(1 \pm \sqrt {c / \log n}\right)\right),
$$

where  $C > 0$  and  $C' \in [1/2, 1]$  are constants and  $R$  is the constraint from Eq. (1).

- If  $p, q = \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$  and  $\Gamma(p, q)^2 \zeta(\gamma/2\sigma) = \omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{n}}\right)$ , then for any  $c > 0$ , with probability at least  $1 - O(n^{-c})$ , the networks with any combination of two graph convolutions in the second and/or the third layers perfectly classify the data, and obtain the following loss:

$$
\ell_ {\theta} (\mathbf {A}, \mathbf {X}) = C ^ {\prime} \exp \left(- C \sigma R \Gamma (p, q) ^ {2} \zeta (\gamma / \sigma) \left(1 \pm \sqrt {c / \log n}\right)\right),
$$

where  $C > 0$  and  $C' \in [1/2, 1]$  are constants and  $R$  is the constraint from Eq. (1).

To understand Theorem 2, it helps to consider the regime where  $\Gamma(p,q) = \Omega(1)$ . Part one of the theorem shows that under the assumption that  $p,q = \Omega(\log^2 n/n)$ , a single graph convolution improves the classification threshold for  $\gamma$ , the distance between the means by a factor of at least  $\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{n(p+q)}$  as compared to the case without the graph. Part two then shows that with a slightly stronger assumption on the graph density, we observe further improvement in the threshold up to a factor of at least  $\frac{1}{4\sqrt{n}}$ . We refer to Appendix A.8 for a comprehensive explanation of this simpler case.

Note that although the regime of graph density is different for part two of the theorem, the result itself is an improvement. In particular, if  $p, q = \Omega(\log n / \sqrt{n})$  then part one of the theorem states that one graph convolution achieves an improvement of at least  $\frac{1}{\sqrt[8]{n}}$ , while part two states that two convolutions improve it to at least  $\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{n}}$ . However, we also emphasize that in the regime where the graph is dense, i.e., when  $p, q = \Omega_n(1)$ , two graph convolutions do not have a significant advantage over one graph convolution. Our experiments in Section 4.1 demonstrate this effect.

An artifact of the XOR-CSBM data model is that a graph convolution in the first layer severely hurts the classification accuracy. Hence, for Theorem 2, our analysis only considers networks with no graph convolution in the first layer, i.e.,  $k_{1} = 0$ . This effect is visualized in Fig. 1, and is attributed to the averaging of data points in the same class but different components of the mixture that have means with opposite signs. We defer the reader to Appendix A.5 for a more formal argument, and to Appendix B.1 for experiments that demonstrate this phenomenon. As  $n$  (the sample size) grows, the difference between the averages of node features over the two classes diminishes (see Figs. 1a and 1b). In other words, the means of the two classes collapse to the same point for large  $n$ . However, in the last layer, since the input consists of transformed features that are linearly separable, a graph convolution helps with the classification task (see Figs. 1c and 1d).

# 3.3 PLACEMENT OF GRAPH CONVOLUTIONS

We observe that the improvements in the classification capability of a multi-layer network depends on the number of convolutions, and does not depend on where the convolutions are placed. In particular, for the XOR-CSBM data model, putting the same number of convolutions among the second and/or the third layer in any combination achieves mutually similar improvements in the classification task.

Corollary 2.1. Consider the data model XOR-CSBM  $(n,d,\pmb {\mu},\pmb {\nu},\sigma^2,p,q)$  and the network architecture from Section 2.2.

- Assume that  $p, q = \Omega(\log^2 n / n)$ , and consider the three-layer network characterized by part one of Theorem 2, with one graph convolution. For this network, placing the graph convolution in the second layer ( $k_2 = 1$ ,  $k_3 = 0$ ) obtains the same results as placing it in the third layer ( $k_2 = 0$ ,  $k_3 = 1$ ).  
- Assume that  $p, q = \Omega(\log n / \sqrt{n})$ , and consider the three-layer network characterized by part two of Theorem 2, with two graph convolutions. For this network, placing both convolutions

in the second layer ( $k_{2} = 2, k_{3} = 0$ ) or both of them in the third layer ( $k_{2} = 0, k_{3} = 2$ ) obtains the same results as placing one convolution in the second layer and one in the third layer ( $k_{2} = 1, k_{3} = 1$ ).

Corollary 2.1 is immediate from the proof of Theorem 2 (see Appendices A.6 and A.7). In Section 4, we also show extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data that demonstrate this result.

# 3.4 PROOF SKETCH

In this section, we provide an overview of the key ideas and intuition behind our proof technique for the results. For comprehensive proofs, see Appendix A.

For part one of Theorem 1, we utilize the assumption on the distribution of the data. Since the underlying distribution of the mixture model is known, we can find the (Bayes) optimal classifier $^4$ ,  $h^*(\mathbf{x})$ , for the XOR-GMM, which takes the form  $h^*(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{1}(|\langle \mathbf{x}, \pmb{\nu} \rangle| - |\langle \mathbf{x}, \pmb{\mu} \rangle|)$ , where  $\mathbb{1}(\cdot)$  is the indicator function. We then compute a lower bound on the probability that  $h^*$  fails to classify one data point from this model, followed by a concentration argument that computes a lower bound on the fraction of points that  $h^*$  fails to classify with overwhelming probability. Consequently, a negative result for the Bayes optimal classifier implies a negative result for all classifiers.

For part two of Theorem 1, we design a two-layer and a three-layer network that realize the (Bayes) optimal classifier. We then use a concentration argument to show that in the regime where the distance between the means is large enough, the function representing our two-layer or three-layer network roughly evaluates to a quantity that has a positive sign for one class and a negative sign for the other class. Furthermore, the output of the function scales with the distance between the means. Thus, with a suitable assumption on the magnitude of the distance between the means, the output of the networks has the correct signs with overwhelming probability. Following this argument, we show

that the cross-entropy loss obtained by the networks can be made arbitrarily small by controlling the optimization constraint  $R$  (see Eq. (1)), implying perfect classification.

For Theorem 2, we observe that for the (Bayes) optimal networks designed for Theorem 1, placing graph convolutions in the second or the third layer reduces the effective variance of the functions representing the network. This stems from the fact that for the data model we consider, multi-layer networks with ReLU activations are Lipschitz functions of Gaussian random variables. First, we compute the precise reduction in the variance of the data characterized by  $K > 0$  graph convolutions (see Lemma A.3). Then for part one of the theorem where we analyze one graph convolution, we use the assumption on the graph density to conclude that the degrees of each node concentrate around the expected degree. This helps us characterize the variance reduction, which further allows the distance between the means to be smaller than in the case of a standard MLP, hence, obtaining an improvement in the threshold for perfect classification<sup>5</sup>. Part two of the theorem studies the placement of two graph convolutions using a very similar argument. In this case, the variance reduction is characterized by the number of common neighbours of a pair of nodes rather than the degree of a node, and is stronger than the variance reduction offered by a single graph convolution.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section we provide empirical evidence that supports our claims in Section 3. We begin by analyzing the synthetic data models XOR-GMM and XOR-CSBM that are crucial to our theoretical results, followed by a similar analysis on multiple real-world datasets tailored for node classification tasks. We show a comparison of the test accuracy obtained by various learning methods in different regimes, along with a display of how the performance changes with the properties of the underlying graph, i.e., with the intra-class and inter-class edge probabilities  $p$  and  $q$ .

For both synthetic and real-world data, the performance of the networks does not change significantly with the choice of the placement of graph convolutions. In particular, placing all convolutions in the last layer achieves a similar performance as any other placement for the same number of convolutions. This observation aligns with the results in Gasteiger et al. (2019).

# 4.1 SYNTHETIC DATA

In this section, we empirically show the landscape of the accuracy achieved for various multi-layer networks with up to three layers and up to two graph convolutions<sup>6</sup>. In Fig. 2, we show that as claimed in Theorem 2, a single graph convolution reduces the classification threshold by a factor of  $\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{\mathbb{E}\deg}}$  and two graph convolutions reduce the threshold by a factor of  $\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{n}}$ , where  $\mathbb{E}\deg = \frac{n}{2}(p + q)$ .

We observe that the placement of graph convolutions does not matter as long as it is not in the first layer. Figs. 2a and 2b show that the performance is mutually similar for all networks that have one graph convolution placed in the second or the third layer, and for all networks that have two graph convolutions placed in any combination among the second and the third layers. In Figs. 2c and 2d, we observe that two graph convolutions do not obtain a significant advantage over one graph convolution in the setting where  $p$  and  $q$  are large, i.e., when the graph is dense. We observed similar results for various other values of  $p$  and  $q$  (see Appendix B.1 for some more plots).

Furthermore, in Appendix B.1 we verify that if a graph convolution is placed in the first layer of a network, then it is difficult to learn a classifier for the XOR-CSBM data model. In this case, test accuracy is low even for the regime where the distance between the means is quite large.

# 4.2 REAL-WORLD DATA

For real-world data, we test our results on three graph benchmarks: CORA, CiteSeer, and Pubmed citation network datasets (Sen et al., 2008). Results for larger datasets are presented in Appendix B.2. We observe the following trends: First, as claimed in Theorem 2, networks that utilize the graph perform remarkably better than a traditional MLP that does not use relational information. Second,

The x-axis denotes the ratio  $K = \| \pmb{\mu} - \pmb{\nu}\|_2 / \sigma$  on a logarithmic scale. The vertical lines indicate the classification thresholds mentioned in part two of Theorem 1 (red), and in Theorem 2 (violet and pink).

all networks with one graph convolution in any layer achieve a mutually similar performance, and all networks with two graph convolutions in any combination of placement achieve a mutually similar performance. This demonstrates a result similar to Corollary 2.1 for real-world data. Finally, networks with two graph convolutions perform better than networks with one graph convolution.

In Fig. 3, we present for all networks, the maximum accuracy over 50 trials, where each trial corresponds to a random initialization of the networks. For 2-layer networks, the hidden layer has width 16, and for 3-layer networks, both hidden layers have width 16. We use a dropout probability of 0.5 and a weight decay of  $10^{-5}$  while training.

For this study, we attribute minor changes in the accuracy to hyperparameters involving dropout and weight decay. This helps us clearly observe the important difference in the accuracy of networks with one graph convolution versus two graph convolutions. For example, in Fig. 3a, we note that there are differences among the accuracy of the networks with one graph convolution (red and blue). However, these differences are minor compared to the networks with one convolution (red and blue) and networks with two convolutions (green and yellow). We also show the averaged accuracy in Appendix B.2. Note that the accuracy slightly differs from well-known results in the literature due to implementation differences. In particular, the GCN implementation in Kipf & Welling (2017) uses  $\tilde{\mathbf{A}} = \mathbf{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$  as the normalized adjacency matrix, however, we use  $\tilde{\mathbf{A}} = \mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{A}$ . In Appendix B.2, we also show empirical results for the normalization  $\tilde{\mathbf{A}} = \mathbf{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ .

# 5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We study the fundamental limits of the capacity of graph convolutions when placed beyond the first layer of a multi-layer network for the XOR-CSBM data model, and provide theoretical guarantees for their performance in different regimes of the signal in the data. Through our experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that the number of convolutions is a more significant factor for determining the performance of a network, rather than the number of layers in the network.

(c) Accuracy of various learning models on the CiteSeer dataset.  
Figure 3: Maximum accuracy (percentage) over 50 trials for various networks. A network with  $k$  layers and  $j_1, \ldots, j_k$  convolutions in each of the layers is represented by the label  $k\mathrm{L} - j_1 \ldots j_k$ .

Furthermore, we show that placing graph convolutions in any combination achieves mutually similar performance enhancements for the same number of them. We observe that multiple graph convolutions are advantageous when the underlying graph is relatively sparse. Intuitively, this is because in a dense graph, a single convolution can gather information from a large number of nodes, while in a sparser graph, more convolutions are needed to gather information from a larger number of nodes.

Our analysis is limited to a positive result and we only provide a minimum guarantee for improvement in the classification threshold. To fully understand the limitations of graph convolutions, a complementary negative result (similar to part one of Theorem 1) for data models with relational information is required, showing the maximum improvement that graph convolutions can realize in a multi-layer network. This problem is hard due to two reasons: First, there does not exist a concrete notion of an optimal classifier for data models which have node features coupled with relational information. Second, a graph convolution transforms an iid set of features into a highly correlated set of features, making it difficult to apply classical high-dimensional concentration arguments. Another potential line of work is to generalize our results for arbitrary data models. However, since our arguments rely heavily on concentration of Gaussian variables, it is hard to extend the analysis to arbitrary distributions. Therefore, we require mathematical tools that are distribution-agnostic.
