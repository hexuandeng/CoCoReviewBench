# ABSTRACT

We analyze the convergence of the averaged stochastic gradient descent for overparameterized two-layer neural networks for regression problems. It was recently found that a neural tangent kernel (NTK) plays an important role in showing the global convergence of gradient-based methods under the NTK regime, where the learning dynamics for overparameterized neural networks can be almost characterized by that for the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, there is still room for a convergence rate analysis in the NTK regime. In this study, we show that the averaged stochastic gradient descent can achieve the minimax optimal convergence rate, with the global convergence guarantee, by exploiting the complexities of the target function and the RKHS associated with the NTK. Moreover, we show that the target function specified by the NTK of a ReLU network can be learned at the optimal convergence rate through a smooth approximation of a ReLU network under certain conditions.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Recent studies have revealed why a stochastic gradient descent for neural networks converges to a global minimum and why it generalizes well under the overparameterized setting in which the number of parameters is larger than the number of given training examples. One prominent approach is to map the learning dynamics for neural networks into function spaces and exploit the convexity of the loss functions with respect to the function. The recently developed notion of a neural tangent kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al., 2018) has provided such a connection between the learning process of a neural network and a kernel method in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with an NTK.

The global convergence of the gradient descent was demonstrated in Du et al. (2019b); Allen-Zhu et al. (2019); Du et al. (2019a) through the development of a theory of NTK with the overparameterization. In these theories, the positivity of the NTK on the given training examples plays a crucial role in exploiting the property of the NTK. Specifically, the positivity of the Gram-matrix of the NTK leads to a rapid decay of the training loss, and thus the learning dynamics can be localized around the initial point of a neural network with the overparameterization, resulting in the equivalence between two learning dynamics for neural networks and kernel methods with the NTK through a linear approximation of neural networks. Moreover, Arora et al. (2019a) provided a generalization bound of  $O(T^{-1/2})$ , where  $T$  is the number of training examples, on a gradient descent under the positivity assumption of the NTK. These studies provided the first steps in understanding the role of the NTK.

However, the eigenvalues of the NTK converge to zero as the number of examples increases, as shown in Su & Yang (2019) (also see Figure 1), resulting in the degeneration of the NTK. This phenomenon indicates that the convergence rates in previous studies in terms of generalization are generally slower than  $O(T^{-1/2})$  owing to the dependence on the minimum eigenvalue. Moreover, Bietti & Mairal (2019); Ronen et al. (2019); Cao et al. (2019) also supported this observation by providing a precise estimation of the decay of the eigenvalues, and Ronen et al. (2019); Cao et al. (2019) proved the spectral bias (Rahaman et al., 2019) for a neural network, where lower frequencies are learned first using a gradient descent.

By contrast, several studies showed faster convergence rates of the (averaged) stochastic gradient descent in the RKHS in terms of the generalization (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2004; Smale & Yao, 2006; Ying & Zhou, 2006; Neu & Rosasco, 2018; Lin et al., 2020). In particular, by extending the results in a finite-dimensional case (Bach & Moulines, 2013), the authors in Dieuleveut et al. (2016; 2017); Pillaud-Vivien et al. (2018b) showed

convergence rates of  $O\left(T^{\frac{-2r\beta}{2r\beta + 1}}\right)$  depending on the complexity  $r \in [1/2, 1]$  of the target functions and the decay rate  $\beta > 1$  of the eigenvalues of the kernel (a.k.a. the complexity of the hypothesis space). In addition, extensions to the random feature settings (Rahimi & Recht, 2007; Rudi & Rosasco, 2017; Carratino et al., 2018) and to the tail-averaging and mini-batching variant (Mücke et al., 2019) have been developed.

Motivation. The convergence rate of  $O(T^{\frac{-2r\beta}{2r\beta + 1}})$  is always faster than  $O(T^{-1 / 2})$  and is known as the minimax optimal convergence rate (Caponnetto & De Vito, 2007; Blanchard & Mücke, 2018). Hence, a gap exists between the theories regarding NTK and kernel methods. In other words, there is still room for an investigation into a stochastic gradient descent due to a lack of specification of the complexities of the target function and the hypothesis space. That is, to obtain faster convergence rates, we should specify the eigenspaces of the NTK that mainly contain the target function (i.e., the complexity of the target function), and specify the decay rates of the eigenvalues of the NTK (i.e., the complexity of the hypothesis space), as studied in kernel methods (Caponnetto & De Vito, 2007; Steinwart et al., 2009; Dieuleveut et al., 2016). In summary, the fundamental question in this study is as follows:

Can stochastic gradient descent for overparameterized neural networks achieve the optimal rate in terms of the generalization by exploiting the complexities of the target function and hypothesis space?

In this study, we answer this question in the affirmative, thereby bridging the gap between the theories of overparameterized neural networks and kernel methods.

# 1.1 CONTRIBUTIONS

The connection between neural networks and kernel methods is being understood via the NTK, but it is still unknown whether the optimal convergence rate faster than  $O(T^{-1/2})$  is achievable by a certain algorithm for neural networks. This is the first paper to overcome technical challenges of achieving the optimal convergence rate under the NTK regime. We obtain the minimax optimal convergence rates (Corollary 1), inherited from the learning dynamics in an RKHS, for an averaged stochastic gradient descent for neural networks. That is, we show that smooth target functions efficiently specified by the NTK are learned rapidly at faster convergence rates than  $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ . Moreover, we obtain an explicit optimal convergence rate of  $O\left(T^{\frac{-2rd}{2rd + d - 1}}\right)$  for a smooth approximation of the ReLU network (Corollary 2), where  $d$  is the dimensionality of the data space and  $r$  is the complexity of the target function specified by the NTK of the ReLU network.

# 1.2 TECHNICAL CHALLENGE

The key to show a global convergence (Theorem 1) is making the connection between kernel methods and neural networks in some sense. Although this sort of analysis has been developed in several studies (Du et al., 2019b; Arora et al., 2019a; Weinan et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2019b; Lee et al., 2019), we would like to emphasize that our results cannot be obtained by direct application of their results. A naive idea is to simply combine their results with the convergence analysis of the stochastic gradient descent for kernel methods, but it does not work. The main reason is that we need the  $L_{2}$ -bound weighted by a true data distribution on the gap between dynamics of stochastic gradient descent for neural networks and kernel methods if we try to derive a convergence rate of population risks for neural networks from that for kernel methods. However, such a bound is not provided in

related studies. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, all related studies make this kind of connection regarding the gap on training dataset or sample-wise high probability bound (Lee et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2019b). That is, a statement "for every input data  $x$  with high probability  $\left|g_{\mathrm{ntk}}^{(t)}(x) - g_{\mathrm{nn}}^{(t)}(x)\right| < \epsilon$  cannot yield a desired statement "  $\| g_{\mathrm{ntk}}^{(t)} - g_{\mathrm{nn}}^{(t)}\|_{L_2(\rho_X)} < \epsilon$  where  $\rho_{X}$  is a marginal distribution over the input space. Moreover, we note that we cannot utilize the positivity of the Gram-matrix of NTK which plays a crucial role in related studies because we consider the population risk with respect to  $L_{2}(\rho_{X})$  rather than the empirical risk. To overcome these difficulties we develop a different strategy of the proof. First, we make a bound on the gap between two dynamics of the averaged stochastic gradient descent for a two-layer neural network and its NTK with width  $M$  and obtain a generalization bound for this intermediate NTK (Theorem A in Appendix). Second, we remove the dependence on the width of  $M$  from the intermediate bound. These steps are not obvious because we need a detailed investigation to handle the misspecification of the target function by an intermediate NTK. Based on detailed analyses, we obtain a faster and precise bound than those in previous results (Arora et al., 2019a).

# 1.3 ADDITIONAL RELATED WORK

Besides the abovementioned studies, there are several works (Chizat & Bach, 2018b; Wu et al., 2019; Zou & Gu, 2019) that have shown the global convergence of (stochastic) gradient descent for overparameterized neural networks essentially relying on the positivity condition of NTK. For classification problems, the positivity condition can be relaxed to a separability condition using another reference model (Cao & Gu, 2019a;b; Nitanda et al., 2019; Ji & Telgarsky, 2019), resulting in a convergence of expected classification errors with rates of  $O(T^{-1/2})$  or  $O(T^{-1/4})$ .

For an averaged stochastic gradient descent on classification problems in RKHSs, linear convergence rates of the expected classification errors have been demonstrated in Pillaud-Vivien et al. (2018a); Nitanda & Suzuki (2019). Although our study focuses on regression problems, we describe how to combine their results with our theory in the Appendix.

The mean field regime (Nitanda & Suzuki, 2017; Mei et al., 2018; Chizat & Bach, 2018a) that is a different limit of neural networks from the NTK is also important for the global convergence analysis of the gradient descent. In the mean field regime, the learning dynamics follows the Wasserstein gradient flow which enable us to establish convergence analysis in the probability space.

Moreover, several studies (Allen-Zhu & Li, 2019; Bai & Lee, 2019; Ghorbani et al., 2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020; Li et al., 2020) attempt to show the superiority of neural networks over kernel methods including the NTK. Although it is also very important to study the conditions beyond the NTK regime, they do not affect our contribution and vice versa. Indeed, which method is better depends on the assumption on the target function and data distribution, so it is important to investigate the optimal convergence rate and optimal method in each regime. As shown in our study, the averaged stochastic gradient descent for learning neural network achieves the optimal convergence rate if the target function is included in RKHS associated with the NTK with the small norm. It means there are no methods that outperform the averaged stochastic gradient descent under this setting.

# 2 PRELIMINARY

Let  $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$  and  $\mathcal{V} \subset \mathbb{R}$  be the measurable feature and label spaces, respectively. We denote by  $\rho$  a probability measure on  $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{V}$ , by  $\rho_X$  the marginal distribution on  $X$ , and by  $\rho(\cdot | X)$  the conditional distribution on  $Y$ , where  $(X, Y) \sim \rho$ . Let  $\ell(z, y) (z \in \mathbb{R}, y \in \mathcal{V})$  be the squared loss function  $\frac{1}{2}(z - y)^2$ , and let  $g: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$  be a hypothesis. The expected risk function we want to minimize is defined as follows:

$$
\mathcal {L} (g) \stackrel {\text {d e f}} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {(X, Y) \sim \rho} [ \ell (g (X), Y) ]. \tag {1}
$$

The Bayes rule  $g_{\rho}:\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}$  is a global minimizer of  $\mathcal{L}$  over all measurable functions.

For the least squares regression, the Bayes rule is known to be  $g_{\rho}(X) = \mathbb{E}_Y[Y|X]$  and the excess risk of a hypothesis  $g$  (which is the difference between the expected risk of  $g$  and the expected risk of the Bayes rule  $g_{\rho}$ ) is expressed as a squared  $L_{2}(\rho_{X})$ -distance between  $g$  and  $g_{\rho}$  (for details, see Cucker & Smale (2002)):

$$
\mathcal {L} (g) = \frac {1}{2} \| g - g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {\rho} ^ {2},
$$

where  $\sigma_{\rho}^{2}\stackrel {def}{=}\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{(X,Y)}[(Y - g_{\rho}(X))^{2}] = \mathcal{L}(g_{\rho})$  is the average of the variance of the label. Hence, the goal of the regression problem is to approximate  $g_{\rho}$  in terms of the  $L_{2}(\rho_{X})$ -distance in a given hypothesis class.

Two-layer Neural Networks. The hypothesis class considered in this study is the set of two-layer neural networks, which is formalized as follows. Let  $M \in \mathbb{Z}_+$  be the network width (number of hidden nodes). Let  $a = (a_1, \ldots, a_M)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^M$  ( $a_r \in \mathbb{R}$ ) be the parameters of the output layer,  $B = (b_1, \ldots, b_M) \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times M}$  ( $b_r \in \mathbb{R}^d$ ) be the parameters of the input layer, and  $c = (c_1, \ldots, c_M)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^M$  ( $c_r \in \mathbb{R}$ ) be the bias parameters. We denote by  $\Theta$  the collection of all parameters ( $a, B, c$ ), and consider two-layer neural networks:

$$
g _ {\Theta} (x) = \frac {1}{\sqrt {M}} \sum_ {r = 1} ^ {M} a _ {r} \sigma \left(b _ {r} ^ {\top} x + \gamma c _ {r}\right), \tag {2}
$$

where  $\sigma : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$  is an activation function and  $\gamma > 0$  is a scale of the bias terms.

Symmetric initialization. We adopt symmetric initialization for the parameters  $\Theta$ . Let  $a^{(0)} = (a_1^{(0)},\ldots ,a_M^{(0)})^\top$ ,  $B^{(0)} = (b_{1}^{(0)},\dots,b_{M}^{(0)})$ , and  $c^{(0)} = (c_{1}^{(0)},\dots,c_{M}^{(0)})^\top$  denote the initial values for  $a, B,$  and  $c$ , respectively. Assume that the number of hidden units  $M \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$  is even. The parameters for the output layer are initialized as  $a_r^{(0)} = R$  for  $r \in \{1,\dots,\frac{M}{2}\}$  and  $a_r^{(0)} = -R$  for  $r \in \{\frac{M}{2} +1,\dots,M\}$ , where  $R > 0$  is a positive constant. Let  $\mu_0$  be a uniform distribution on the sphere  $\mathbb{S}^{d-1} = \{b \in \mathbb{R}^d \mid \|b\|_2 = 1\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$  used to initialize the parameters for the input layer. The parameters for the input layer are initialized as  $b_r^{(0)} = b_{r+\frac{M}{2}}^{(0)}$  for  $r \in \{1,\dots,\frac{M}{2}\}$ , where  $(b_r^{(0)})_{r=1}^{\frac{M}{2}}$  are independently drawn from the distribution  $\mu_0$ . The bias parameters are initialized as  $c_r^{(0)} = 0$  for  $r \in \{1,\dots,M\}$ . The aim of the symmetric initialization is to make an initial function  $g_{\Theta^{(0)}} = 0$ , where  $\Theta^{(0)} = (a^{(0)},B^{(0)},c^{(0)})$ . This is just for theoretical simplicity. Indeed, we can relax the symmetric initialization by considering an additional error stemming from the nonzero initialization in the function space.

Regularized Expected Risk Minimization. Instead of minimizing the expected risk (1) itself, we consider the minimization problem of the regularized expected risk around the initial values:

$$
\min  _ {\Theta} \left\{\mathcal {L} \left(g _ {\Theta}\right) + \frac {\lambda}{2} \left(\| a - a ^ {(0)} \| _ {2} ^ {2} + \| B - B ^ {(0)} \| _ {F} ^ {2} + \| c - c ^ {(0)} \| _ {2} ^ {2}\right) \right\}. \tag {3}
$$

where the last term is the  $L_{2}$ -regularization at an initial point with a regularization parameter  $\lambda > 0$ . This regularization forces iterations obtained by optimization algorithms to stay close to the initial value, which enables us to utilize the better convergence property of regularized kernel methods.

Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent. A stochastic gradient descent is the most popular method for solving large-scale machine learning problems, and its averaged variant is also frequently used to stabilize and accelerate the convergence. In this study, we analyze the generalization ability of an averaged stochastic gradient descent. The update rule is presented in Algorithm 1. We denote by  $\eta_t$  and  $\alpha_t$  the learning rate and averaging weight, respectively. In this study, we consider the constant learning rate  $\eta_t = \eta$  and uniform averaging  $\alpha_t = 1 / (T + 1)$ .

Integral and Covariance Operators. The integral and covariance operators associated with the kernels, which are the limit of the Gram-matrix as the number of examples goes to infinity, play a crucial role in determining the learning speed. For a given Hilbert space  $\mathcal{H}$ , we denote by  $\otimes_{\mathcal{H}}$  the tensor product on  $\mathcal{H}$ , that is,  $\forall (f,g)\in \mathcal{H}^2$ ,  $f\otimes_{\mathcal{H}}g$  defines a linear operator;  $h\in \mathcal{H}\mapsto (f\otimes_{\mathcal{H}}g)h = \langle f,h\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}g\in \mathcal{H}$ . Note that  $f\otimes_{\mathcal{H}}g$  naturally induces a bilinear function:  $(h,h^{\prime})\in \mathcal{H}\times \mathcal{H}\mapsto \langle (f\otimes_{\mathcal{H}}g)h,h^{\prime}\rangle_{\mathcal{H}} = \langle f,h\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}\langle g,h^{\prime}\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$ . When  $\mathcal{H}$  is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with a bounded kernel  $k:\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}$ , the covariance operator  $\Sigma :\mathcal{H}\mapsto \mathcal{H}$  is defined as follows: Set  $K_{X}\stackrel {def}{=}k(X,\cdot)$  and

$$
\Sigma = \mathbb {E} _ {X \sim \rho_ {X}} \left[ K _ {X} \otimes_ {\mathcal {H}} K _ {X} \right].
$$

Note that the covariance operator is a restriction of the integral operator on  $L_{2}(\rho_{X})$ :

$$
f \in L _ {2} (\rho_ {X}) \longmapsto \Sigma f = \int_ {\mathcal {X}} f (X) K _ {X} \mathrm {d} \rho_ {X} \in L _ {2} (\rho_ {X}).
$$

Algorithm 1 Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent  
Input: number of iterations  $T$ , regularization parameter  $\lambda$ , learning rates  $(\eta_t)_{t=0}^{T-1}$ , averaging weights  $(\alpha_t)_{t=0}^T$ , initial values  $\Theta^{(0)} = (a^{(0)}, B^{(0)}, c^{(0)})$   
for  $t = 0$  to  $T - 1$  do  
    Randomly draw a sample  $(x_t, y_t) \sim \rho$ $a^{(t+1)} \gets a^{(t)} - \eta_t \partial_a \ell(g_{\Theta^{(t)}}(x_t), y_t) - \eta_t \lambda(a^{(t)} - a^{(0)})$ $B^{(t+1)} \gets B^{(t)} - \eta_t \partial_B \ell(g_{\Theta^{(t)}}(x_t), y_t) - \eta_t \lambda(B^{(t)} - B^{(0)})$ $c^{(t+1)} \gets c^{(t)} - \eta_t \partial_c \ell(g_{\Theta^{(t)}}(x_t), y_t) - \eta_t \lambda(c^{(t)} - c^{(0)})$ $\Theta^{(t+1)} \gets (a^{(t+1)}, B^{(t+1)}, c^{(t+1)})$

Return  $g_{\overline{\Theta}^{(T)}}$

We use the same symbol as above for convenience with a slight abuse of notation. Because  $\Sigma$  is a compact self-adjoint operator on  $L_{2}(\rho_{X})$ ,  $\Sigma$  has the following eigendecomposition:  $\Sigma f = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \lambda_{i} \langle f, \phi_{i} \rangle_{L_{2}(\rho_{X})} \phi_{i}$  for  $f \in L_{2}(\rho_{X})$ , where  $\{(\lambda_{i}, \phi_{i})\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$  is a pair of eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenfunctions in  $L_{2}(\rho_{X})$ . For  $s \in \mathbb{R}$ , the power  $\Sigma^{s}$  is defined as  $\Sigma^{s}f = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \lambda_{i}^{s} \langle f, \phi_{i} \rangle_{L_{2}(\rho_{X})} \phi_{i}$ .

# 3 MAIN RESULTS: MINIMAX OPTIMAL CONVERGENCE RATES

In this section, we present the main results regarding the fast convergence rates of the averaged stochastic gradient descent under a certain condition on the NTK and target function  $g_{\rho}$ . To this end, we first introduce some notions.

Neural tangent kernel. The NTK is a recently developed kernel function and has been shown to be extremely useful in demonstrating the global convergence of the gradient descent method for neural networks (cf., Jacot et al. (2018); Chizat & Bach (2018b); Du et al. (2019b); Allen-Zhu et al. (2019); Arora et al. (2019a)). The NTK in our setting is defined as follows:  $\forall x, \forall x' \in \mathcal{X}$ ,

$$
k _ {\infty} (x, x ^ {\prime}) \stackrel {d e f} {=} \mathbb {E} _ {b ^ {(0)}} [ \sigma (b ^ {(0) \top} x) \sigma (b ^ {(0) \top} x ^ {\prime}) ] + R ^ {2} (x ^ {\top} x ^ {\prime} + \gamma^ {2}) \mathbb {E} _ {b ^ {(0)}} [ \sigma^ {\prime} (b ^ {(0) \top} x) \sigma^ {\prime} (b ^ {(0) \top} x ^ {\prime}) ], \tag {4}
$$

where the expectation is taken with respect to  $b^{(0)} \sim \mu_0$ . The NTK is the key to the global convergence of a neural network because it makes a connection between the (averaged) stochastic gradient descent for a neural networks and the RKHS associated with  $k_{\infty}$  (see Proposition A in the Appendix). Although this type of connection has been shown in previous studies (Arora et al., 2019b; Lee et al., 2019; Weinan et al., 2019), note that their results are inapplicable to our theory because we consider the population risk. Indeed, our study is the first to establish this connection for an (averaged) stochastic gradient descent in terms of the uniform distance on the support of the data distribution, enabling us to obtain faster convergence rates. We note that an NTK  $k_{\infty}$  is the sum of two NTKs, that is, the first and second terms in (4) are NTKs for the output and input layers with bias, respectively.

# 3.1 GLOBAL CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS

Let  $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$  be an RKHS associated with NTK  $k_{\infty}$ , and let  $\Sigma_{\infty}$  be the corresponding integral operator. Let  $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$  denote the eigenvalues of  $\Sigma_{\infty}$  sorted in decreasing order:  $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \dots$ .

# Assumption 1.

(A1) There exists  $C > 0$  such that  $\| \sigma^{\prime \prime}\|_{\infty}\leq C$ $\| \sigma^{\prime}\|_{\infty}\leq 2$  , and  $|\sigma (u)|\leq 1 + |u|$  for  $\forall u\in \mathbb{R}$  
(A2)  $\operatorname{supp}(\rho_X) \subset \{x \in \mathbb{R}^d \mid \| x \|_2 \leq 1\}$ ,  $\mathcal{Y} \subset [-1, 1]$ ,  $R = 1$ , and  $\gamma \in (0, 1]$ .  
(A3) There exists  $r \in [1/2, 1]$  such that  $g_{\rho} \in \Sigma_{\infty}^{r}(L_{2}(\rho_{X}))$ , i.e.,  $\| \Sigma_{\infty}^{-r}g_{\rho}\|_{L_2(\rho_X)} < \infty$ .  
(A4) There exists  $\beta > 1$  such that  $\lambda_i = \Theta(i^{-\beta})$ .

# Remark.

- Typical smooth bounded activation functions, such as sigmoid and tanh functions, and smooth approximations of the ReLU, such as swish (Ramachandran et al., 2017), which performs as well as or even better than the ReLU, satisfy Assumption (A1). This condition is used to relate the two learning dynamics between neural networks and kernel methods (see Proposition A in the Appendix).  
- The boundedness (A2) of the feature space and label are often assumed for stochastic optimization and least squares regression for theoretical guarantees (see Steinwart et al. (2009)). Note that these constants in (A2) can be relaxed to arbitrary constants.  
- Assumption (A3) measures the complexity of  $g_{\rho}$  because  $\Sigma_{\infty}$  can be considered a smoothing operator using a kernel  $k_{\infty}$ . A larger  $r$  indicates a faster decay of the coefficients of expansion of  $g_{\rho}$  based on the eigenfunctions of  $\Sigma_{\infty}$  and smoothens  $g_{\rho}$ . In addition,  $\Sigma_{\infty}^{r}(L_{2}(\rho_{X}))$  shrinks with respect to  $r$  and  $\Sigma_{\infty}^{1/2}(L_{2}(\rho_{X})) = \mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ , resulting in  $g_{\rho} \in \mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ . This condition is used to control the bias of the estimators through  $L_{2}$ -regularization. The notation  $\Sigma_{\infty}^{-r}g_{\rho}$  represents any function  $G \in L_{2}(\rho_{X})$  such that  $g_{\rho} = \Sigma_{\infty}^{r}G$ .  
- Assumption (A4) controls the complexity of the hypothesis class  $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ . A larger  $\beta$  indicates a faster decay of the eigenvalues and makes  $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$  smaller. This assumption is essentially needed to bound the variance of the estimators efficiently and derive a fast convergence rate.

Under these assumptions, we derive the convergence rate of the averaged stochastic gradient descent for an overparameterized two-layer neural network, the proof is provided in the Appendix.

Theorem 1. Suppose Assumptions (A1)-(A3) hold. Run Algorithm 1 with a constant learning rate  $\eta$  satisfying  $4(6 + \lambda)\eta \leq 1$ . Then, for any  $\epsilon > 0$ ,  $\| \Sigma_{\infty}\|_{\mathrm{op}} \geq \lambda > 0$ ,  $\delta \in (0,1)$ , and  $T \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$ , there exists  $M_0 \in \mathbb{Z}_+$  such that for any  $M \geq M_0$ , the following holds with high probability at least  $1 - \delta$  over the random choice of features  $\Theta^{(0)}$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathbb {E} \left[ \| g _ {\overline {{\Theta}} ^ {(T)}} - g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2} \right] \leq \epsilon + \alpha \left(\lambda^ {2 r} \| \Sigma_ {\infty} ^ {- r} g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{T + 1} \| g _ {\rho} \| _ {\mathcal {H} _ {\infty}} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{\lambda \eta^ {2} (T + 1) ^ {2}} \| g _ {\rho} \| _ {\mathcal {H} _ {\infty}} ^ {2}\right) \\ + \frac {\alpha}{T + 1} \left(1 + \| g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2} + \| \Sigma_ {\infty} ^ {- r} g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2}\right) \operatorname {T r} \left(\Sigma_ {\infty} (\Sigma_ {\infty} + \lambda I) ^ {- 1}\right), \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\alpha > 0$  is a universal constant and  $g_{\overline{\Theta}^{(T)}}$  is an iterate obtained through Algorithm 1.

Remark. The first term  $\epsilon$  and second term  $\lambda^{2r}\| \Sigma_{\infty}^{-r}g_{\rho}\|_{L_2(\rho_X)}^2$  are the approximation error and bias, which can be chosen to be arbitrary small. The first term comes from the approximation of the NTK using finite-sized neural networks, and the second term comes from the  $L_{2}$ -regularization, which coincides with a bias term in the theory of least squares regression (Caponnetto & De Vito, 2007). The third and fourth terms come from the convergence of the averaged semi-stochastic gradient descent (which is considered in the proof) in terms of the optimization. The appearance of a negative dependence on  $\lambda$  in the fourth term is common because a smaller  $\lambda$  indicates a weaker strong convexity, which slows down the convergence speed of the optimization methods (Rakhlin et al., 2012). The term  $\mathrm{Tr}\left(\Sigma_{\infty}(\Sigma_{\infty} + \lambda I)^{-1}\right)$  is the variance from the stochastic approximation of the gradient, and it is referred to as the degree of freedom or the effective dimension, which is known to be unavoidable in kernel regression problems (Caponnetto & De Vito, 2007; Dieuleveut et al., 2016; Rudi & Rosasco, 2017).

Global convergence in NTK regime. This theorem shows the global convergence to the Bayes rule  $g_{\rho}$ , which is a minimizer over all measurable maps because the approximation term  $\epsilon$  can be arbitrary small by taking a sufficiently large network width  $M$ . The required value of  $M$  has an exponential dependence on  $T$ ; note, however, that reducing  $M$  is not the main focus of the present study. The key technique is to relate two learning dynamics for two-layer neural networks and kernel methods in an RKHS approximating  $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$  up to a small error.

Unlike existing studies (Du et al., 2019b; Arora et al., 2019a;b; Weinan et al., 2019) showing such connections, our study establishes this connection in terms of the  $L_{\infty}(\rho_X)$ -norm, which is more useful in a generalization analysis. Moreover, existing studies essentially rely on the strict positivity of the Gram-matrix to localize all iterates around an initial value, which can slow down the convergence rate in terms of the generalization because the convergence of the eigenvalues of the NTK to zero affects the Rademacher complexity. By contrast, our theory succeeds in demonstrating the global convergence in the NTK regime with the overparameterization and without the positivity of the NTK.

# 3.2 OPTIMAL CONVERGENCE RATE

We derive the fast convergence rate from Theorem 1 by utilizing Assumption (A4), which defines the complexity of the NTK. The regularization parameter  $\lambda$  mainly controls the trade-off within the generalization bound, that is, a smaller value decreases the bias term but increases the variance term including the degree of freedom. The degree of freedom  $\mathrm{Tr}\left(\Sigma_{\infty}(\Sigma_{\infty} + \lambda I)^{-1}\right)$  can be specified by imposing Assumption (A4) because it determines the decay rate of the eigenvalues of  $\Sigma_{\infty}$ . As a result, this trade-off between bias and variance depending on the choice of  $\lambda$  becomes clear, and we can determine the optimal value. Concretely, by setting  $\lambda = T^{-\beta /(2r\beta +1)}$ , the sum of the bias and variance terms is minimized, and these terms become asymptotically equivalent.

Corollary 1. Suppose Assumptions (A1)-(A4) hold. Run Algorithm 1 with the constant learning rate  $\eta = O(1)$  satisfying  $4(6 + \lambda)\eta \leq 1$  and  $\lambda = T^{-\beta/(2r\beta + 1)}$ . Then, for any  $\epsilon > 0$ ,  $\delta \in (0, 1)$  and  $T \in \mathbb{Z}_+$  satisfying  $\|\Sigma_{\infty}\|_{\mathrm{op}} \geq \lambda$ , there exists  $M_0 \in \mathbb{Z}_+$  such that for any  $M \geq M_0$ , the following holds with high probability at least  $1 - \delta$  over the random choice of random features  $\Theta^{(0)}$ :

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ \| g _ {\overline {{\Theta}} ^ {(T)}} - g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2} \right] \leq \epsilon + \alpha T ^ {\frac {- 2 r \beta}{2 r \beta + 1}} \left(1 + \| \Sigma_ {\infty} ^ {- r} g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2}\right),
$$

where  $\alpha > 0$  is a universal constant and  $g_{\overline{\Theta}^{(T)}}$  is an iterate obtained by Algorithm 1.

The resulting convergence rate is  $O(T^{\frac{-2r\beta}{2r\beta + 1}})$  with respect to  $T$  by considering a sufficiently large network width of  $M$  such that the error  $\epsilon$  stemming from the approximation of NTK can be ignored. Because  $T$  corresponds to the number of examples used to learn a predictor  $g_{\overline{\Theta}^{(T)}}$ , this convergence rate is simply the generalization error bound for the averaged stochastic gradient descent. In general, this rate is always faster than  $T^{-1/2}$  and is known to be the minimax optimal rate of estimation (Caponnetto & De Vito, 2007; Blanchard & Mücke, 2018) in  $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$  in the following sense. Let  $\mathcal{P}(\beta, r)$  be a data distribution class satisfying Assumptions (A2)-(A4). Then,

$$
\lim _ {\tau \to 0} \lim _ {T \to \infty} \inf _ {h ^ {(T)}} \sup _ {\rho} \mathbb {P} \left[ \| h ^ {(T)} - g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2} > \tau T ^ {\frac {- 2 r \beta}{2 r \beta + 1}} \right] = 1,
$$

where  $\rho$  is taken in  $\mathcal{P}(\beta, r)$  and  $h^{(T)}$  is taken over all mappings  $(x_t, y_t)_{t=0}^{T-1} \mapsto h^{(T)} \in \mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ .

# 3.3 EXPLICIT OPTIMAL CONVERGENCE RATE FOR SMOOTH APPROXIMATION OF RELU

For smooth activation functions that sufficiently approximate the ReLU, an optimal explicit convergence rate can be derived under the setting in which the target function is specified by NTK with the ReLU, and the data are distributed uniformly on a sphere. We denote the ReLU activation by  $\sigma(u) = \max\{0, u\}$  and a smooth approximation of ReLU by  $\sigma^{(s)}$ , which converges to ReLU, as  $s \to \infty$  in the following sense. We make alternative assumptions to (A1), (A2), and (A3):

# Assumption 2.

(A1')  $\sigma^{(s)}$  satisfies (A1).  $\sigma^{(s)}$  and  $\sigma^{(s)'}$  converge pointwise almost surely to  $\sigma$  and  $\sigma'$  as  $s \to \infty$ .  
(A2')  $\rho_{X}$  is a uniform distribution on  $\{x\in \mathbb{R}^d\mid \| x\| _2 = 1\}$ .  $\mathcal{Y}\subset [-1,1], R = 1,$  and  $\gamma \in (0,1]$ .  
(A3') The condition (A3) is satisfied by the NTK associated with the ReLU activation  $\sigma$ .

Clearly, (A1') and (A2') are special cases of (A1) and (A2). There are several activation functions that satisfy this condition, including swish (Ramachandran et al., 2017):  $\sigma^{(s)}(u) = \frac{u}{1 + \exp(-su)}$ . Under these conditions, we can estimate the decay rate of the eigenvalues for the ReLU as  $\beta = 1 + \frac{1}{d - 1}$ , yielding the explicit optimal convergence rate by adapting the proof of Theorem 1 to the current setting. Note that Algorithm 1 is run for a neural network with a smooth approximation  $\sigma^{(s)}$  of the ReLU.

Corollary 2. Suppose Assumptions (A1'), (A2'), and (A3') hold. Run Algorithm 1 with the constant learning rate  $\eta = O(1)$  satisfying  $4(6 + \lambda)\eta \leq 1$ , and  $\lambda = T^{-d / (2rd + d - 1)}$ . Given any  $\epsilon > 0$ ,  $\delta \in (0,1)$  and  $T \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$  satisfying  $\| \Sigma_{\infty}\|_{\mathrm{op}} \geq 2\lambda$ , let  $s$  be an arbitrary and sufficiently large positive value. Then, there exists  $M_0 \in \mathbb{Z}_+$  such that for any  $M \geq M_0$ , the following holds with high probability at least  $1 - \delta$  over the random choice of random features  $\Theta^{(0)}$ :

$$
\mathbb {E} \big [ \| g _ {\overline {{\Theta}} ^ {(T)}} - g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2} \big ] \leq \epsilon + \alpha T ^ {\frac {- 2 r d}{2 r d + d - 1}} \left(1 + \| \Sigma_ {\infty} ^ {- r} g _ {\rho} \| _ {L _ {2} (\rho_ {X})} ^ {2}\right),
$$

where  $\alpha > 0$  is a universal constant and  $g_{\overline{\Theta}^{(T)}}$  is an iterate obtained by Algorithm 1.

# 4 EXPERIMENTS

We verify the importance of the specification of target functions by showing the misspecification significantly slows down the convergence speed. To evaluate the misspecification, we consider the single-layer learning as well as the two-layer learning, and we see the advantage of two-layer learning. Here, note that, with evident modification of the proofs, the counterparts of Corollaries 1 and 2 for learning a single layer also hold by replacing  $\Sigma_{\infty}$  with the covariance operator  $\Sigma_{a,\infty}(\Sigma_{b,\infty})$  associated with  $k_{a,\infty}(k_{b,\infty})$ , where

$$
k _ {a, \infty} (x, x ^ {\prime}) = \mathbb {E} _ {b ^ {(0)}} [ \sigma (b ^ {(0) \top} x) \sigma (b ^ {(0) \top} x ^ {\prime}) ],
$$

$$
k _ {b, \infty} (x, x ^ {\prime}) = R ^ {2} \left(x ^ {\top} x ^ {\prime} + \gamma^ {2}\right) \mathbb {E} _ {b ^ {(0)}} \left[ \sigma^ {\prime} \left(b ^ {(0) \top} x\right) \sigma^ {\prime} \left(b ^ {(0) \top} x ^ {\prime}\right) \right],
$$

which are components of  $k_{\infty} = k_{a,\infty} + k_{b,\infty}$  corresponding to the output and input layers, respectively. Then, from Corollaries 1 and 2, a Bayes rule  $g_{\rho}$  is learned efficiently by optimizing the layer which has a small norm  $\| \Sigma^{-r}g_{\rho}\|_{L_2(\rho_X)}$  for  $\Sigma \in \{\Sigma_{a,\infty},\Sigma_{b,\infty},\Sigma_{\infty}\}$ .

Experimental settings. Figure 2 (Top) depicts norms  $\| \Sigma^{-r}g_{\rho}\|_{L_2(\rho_X)}$  for  $\Sigma \in \{\Sigma_{a,\infty},\Sigma_{b,\infty},\Sigma_{\infty}\}$ . Bayes rules  $g_{\rho}$  are averages of eigenfunctions of  $\Sigma_{a,\infty}$  (left),  $\Sigma_{b,\infty}$  (middle), and  $\Sigma_{\infty}$  (right) corresponding to the 10-largest eigenvalues excluding the first and second, with the setting:  $R = 1 / (20\sqrt{2})$ ,  $\gamma = 10\sqrt{2}$ , and  $\rho_{X}$  is the uniform distribution on the unit sphere in  $\mathbb{R}^2$ . To estimate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we draw  $10^{4}$ -samples from  $\rho_{X}$  and  $M = 2\times 10^{4}$ -hidden nodes of a two-layer ReLU.

Empirical observations. We observe  $g_{\rho}$  has the smallest norm with respect to the integral operator which specifies  $g_{\rho}$  and has a comparably small norm with respect to  $\Sigma_{\infty}$  even for the cases where  $g_{\rho}$  is specified by  $\Sigma_{a,\infty}$  or  $\Sigma_{b,\infty}$ . This observation suggests the efficiency of learning a corresponding layer to  $g_{\rho}$  and learning both layers, and it is empirically verified. We run Algorithm 1 10-times with respect to output (blue), input (purple), and both layers (orange) of two-layer swish networks with  $s = 10$ . Figure 2 (Bottom) depicts the average and standard deviation of test errors. From the figure, we see that learning a corresponding layer to  $g_{\rho}$  and both layers exhibit faster convergence, and that misspecification significantly slows down the convergence speed in all cases

# 5 CONCLUSION

We analyzed the convergence of the averaged stochastic gradient descent for overparameterized two-layer neural networks for a regression problem. Through the development of a new proof strategy that does not rely on the positivity of the NTK, we proved that the global convergence (Theorem 1) relies only on the overparameterization. Moreover, we demonstrated the minimax optimal convergence rates (Corollary 1) in terms of the generalization error depending on the complexities of the target function and the hypothesis class and showed the explicit optimal rate for the smooth approximation of the ReLU.
