# ABSTRACT

Distributed optimization is essential for training large models on large datasets. Multiple approaches have been proposed to reduce the communication overhead in distributed training, such as synchronizing only after performing multiple local SGD steps, and decentralized methods (e.g., using gossip algorithms) to decouple communications among workers. Although these methods run faster than ALLREDUCE-based methods, which use blocking communication before every update, the resulting models may be less accurate after the same number of updates. Inspired by the BMUF method of Chen & Huo (2016), we propose a slow momentum (SLOWMo) framework, where workers periodically synchronize and perform a momentum update, after multiple iterations of a base optimization algorithm. Experiments on image classification and machine translation tasks demonstrate that SLOWMo consistently yields improvements in optimization and generalization performance relative to the base optimizer, even when the additional overhead is amortized over many updates so that the SLOWMo runtime is on par with that of the base optimizer. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees showing that SLOWMo converges to a stationary point of smooth non-convex losses. Since BMUF is a particular instance of the SLOWMo framework, our results also correspond to the first theoretical convergence guarantees for BMUF.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Distributed optimization (Chen et al., 2016; Goyal et al., 2017) is essential for training large models on large datasets (Radford et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Mahajan et al., 2018b). Currently, the most widely-used approaches have workers compute small mini-batch gradients locally, in parallel, and then aggregate these using a blocking communication primitive, ALLREDUCE, before taking an optimizer step. Communication overhead is a major issue limiting the scaling of this approach, since ALLREDUCE must complete before every step and blocking communications are sensitive to stragglers (Dutta et al., 2018; Ferdinand et al., 2019).

Multiple complementary approaches have recently been investigated to reduce or hide communication overhead. Decentralized training (Jiang et al., 2017; Lian et al., 2017; 2018; Assran et al., 2019) reduces idling due to blocking and stragglers by employing approximate gradient aggregation (e.g., via gossip or distributed averaging). Approaches such as Local SGD reduce the frequency of communication by having workers perform multiple updates between each round of communication (McDonald et al., 2010; McMahan et al., 2017; Zhou & Cong, 2018; Stich, 2019; Yu et al., 2019b). It is also possible to combine decentralized algorithms with Local SGD (Wang & Joshi, 2018; Wang et al., 2019). These approaches reduce communication overhead while injecting additional noise into the optimization process. Consequently, although they run faster than large minibatch methods, the resulting models may not achieve the same quality in terms of training loss or generalization accuracy after the same number of iterations.

Momentum is believed to be a critical component for training deep networks, and it has been empirically demonstrated to improve both optimization and generalization (Sutskever et al., 2013). Yet, there is no consensus on how to combine momentum with communication efficient training algorithms. Momentum is typically incorporated into such approaches by having workers maintain separate buffers which are not synchronized (Lian et al., 2017; 2018; Assran et al., 2019). However, recent work shows that synchronizing the momentum buffer, using periodic ALLREDUCE or a de

centralized method, leads to improvements in accuracy at the cost of doubling the communication overhead (Yu et al., 2019a). In block-wise model update filtering (BMUF), nodes perform multiple local optimization steps between communication rounds (similar to local SGD), and they also maintain a momentum buffer that is only updated after each communication round (Chen & Huo, 2016). Although it is now commonly used for training speech models, there are no theoretical convergence guarantees for BMUF, and it has not been widely applied to other tasks (e.g., in computer vision or natural language processing).

Inspired by BMUF, we propose a general framework called slow momentum (SLOWMO) to improve the accuracy of communication-efficient distributed training methods. SLOWMO runs on top of a base algorithm, which could be local SGD or a decentralized method such as stochastic gradient push (SGP) (Nedic & Olshevsky, 2016; Assran et al., 2019). Periodically, after taking some number  $\tau$  of base algorithm steps, workers average their parameters using ALLREDUCE and perform a momentum update. We demonstrate empirically that SLOWMO consistently improves optimization and generalization performance across a variety of base algorithms on image classification and neural machine translation tasks—training ResNets on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and training a transformer on WMT'16 En-De. Ultimately, SLOWMO allows us to reap the speedup and scaling performance of communication-efficient distributed methods without sacrificing as much in accuracy.

We also prove theoretical bounds showing that SLOWMO converges to a stationary point of smooth non-convex functions at a rate  $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{mT\tau})$  after  $T\tau$  total inner optimization steps and  $T$  SLOWMO updates with  $m$  worker nodes, for a variety of base optimizers. Thus, SLOWMO is order-wise no slower than stochastic gradient descent. Both BMUF and the recently-proposed Lookahead optimizer (Zhang et al., 2019) can be seen as special cases of SLOWMO, and so our results also translate to the first theoretical convergence guarantees for both of these methods.

# 2 THE SLOW MOMENTUM (SLOWMO) FRAMEWORK

SLOWMo is a framework intended for solving stochastic optimization problems of the form

$$
\min  _ {\boldsymbol {x} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {d}} \frac {1}{m} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \mathbb {E} _ {\xi_ {i} \sim D _ {i}} F _ {i} (\boldsymbol {x}; \xi_ {i}), \tag {1}
$$

using  $m$  worker nodes, where the loss function term  $F_{i}$  and samples  $\xi_{i}$  from the distribution  $D_{i}$  are available at the  $i$ th worker. SLOWMO builds on top of a base optimization algorithm and has a nested loop structure shown in Algorithm 1. Each worker maintains a local copy of the parameters,  $\boldsymbol{x}_{t,k}^{(i)}$  at worker  $i$  after the  $k$ th inner step of the  $t$ th outer iteration. We assume that all workers are initialized to the same point  $\boldsymbol{x}_{0,0}$ , and the framework also uses a slow momentum buffer  $\boldsymbol{u}_t$  which is initialized to  $\boldsymbol{u}_0 = \mathbf{0}$ ; although each worker stores a copy of  $\boldsymbol{u}_t$  locally, these are always synchronized across all nodes, so we omit the superscript to simplify the notation.

Within each outer iteration, workers first take  $\tau$  steps of the base optimizer. This could be a method which involves no communication, such as SGD (with or without momentum) or a decentralized algorithm which involves some communication, such as stochastic gradient push (SGP) (Assran et al., 2019). We denote these updates by  $\boldsymbol{x}_{t,k+1}^{(i)} = \boldsymbol{x}_{t,k}^{(i)} - \gamma_t \boldsymbol{d}_{t,k}^{(i)}$  where  $\gamma_t$  is the base optimizer (fast) learning rate and  $\boldsymbol{d}_{t,k}^{(i)}$  is the descent direction used at worker  $i$ . If the base optimizer is SGD then  $\boldsymbol{d}_{t,k}^{(i)} = \nabla F_i(\boldsymbol{x}_{t,k}^{(i)}; \xi_{t,k}^{(i)})$ . For other base optimizers which may use additional buffers or communication,  $\boldsymbol{d}_{t,k}^{(i)}$  represents the full update applied at worker  $i$  on this step.

After the  $\tau$  base optimizer steps, the workers calculate the average  $\pmb{x}_{t,\tau} = \pmb{x}_{t,0} - \frac{\gamma_t}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\sum_{k = 0}^{\tau -1}\pmb{d}_{t,k}^{(i)}$  using ALLREDUCE (line 6), and then they perform a slow momentum update (lines 7-8),

$$
\boldsymbol {u} _ {t + 1} = \beta \boldsymbol {u} _ {t} + \frac {1}{\gamma_ {t}} \left(\boldsymbol {x} _ {t, 0} - \boldsymbol {x} _ {t, \tau}\right) \tag {2}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol {x} _ {t + 1, 0} = \boldsymbol {x} _ {t, 0} - \alpha \gamma_ {t} \boldsymbol {u} _ {t + 1}. \tag {3}
$$

Although the workers perform this update locally, in parallel, we again omit superscripts because the values of  $\boldsymbol{x}_{t,0}$ ,  $\boldsymbol{x}_{t,\tau}$ , and hence  $\boldsymbol{u}_{t+1}$  and  $\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1,0}$  are always identical across all workers, since they follow the ALLREDUCE in line 6. Note that the difference  $\boldsymbol{x}_{t,0} - \boldsymbol{x}_{t,\tau}$  is scaled by  $\frac{1}{\gamma_t}$  in (2) to make the slow momentum buffer invariant to the fast learning rate  $\gamma_t$ , which may change through training, e.g., when using a learning rate schedule. The outer update in line 8 uses the product  $\alpha \gamma_t$  of the slow and fast learning rates. We use the distinction between slow and fast because the base optimizer step is applied  $\tau$  times for each outer update, but this is not intended to imply that one learning rate is necessarily bigger or smaller than the other. We give specific examples of learning rates and other hyperparameters used in the experiments in Section 4 below.

A specific SLOWMO algorithm instance is obtained by specifying the base algorithm and the hyperparameters  $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ , and  $\tau$ . We can recover a number of existing algorithms in this framework. When the base algorithm is SGD,  $\tau = 1$ ,  $\alpha = 1$ , and  $\beta \in [0,1)$ , we recover standard large mini-batch SGD with learning rate  $\gamma$ . When the base algorithm is SGD,  $\tau > 1$ ,  $\alpha = 1$ , and  $\beta = 0$ , we recover Local SGD (McDonald et al., 2010; Stich, 2019; Yu et al., 2019b; Wang & Joshi, 2018). When the base algorithm is SGD,  $\tau > 1$ ,  $\alpha = 1$ , and  $\beta > 0$ , we recover BMUF (Chen & Huo, 2016).

We also obtain interesting novel distributed algorithms. In particular, the experiments in Section 4 demonstrate that using SLOWMo with a decentralized base algorithm like SGP and reasonable values of  $\tau$  consistently leads to improved optimization and generalization performance over the base method alone, without a significant increase in runtime. We also observe empirically that, for a fixed number of iterations, SLOWMo combined with SGP is superior to SLOWMo combined with SGD.

The above are all distributed algorithms. Perhaps surprisingly, SLOWMo also encompasses a recently-introduced non-distributed method: if we have  $m = 1$  worker with SGD as the base algorithm,  $\alpha \in (0,1]$ ,  $\beta = 0$ , and  $\tau > 0$ , we recover the Lookahead optimizer of Zhang et al. (2019), which also has a nested loop structure. Section 5 provides theoretical convergence guarantees when using the SLOWMo framework to minimize smooth non-convex functions, and thus provides the first theoretical convergence guarantees in the literature for BMUF and Lookahead in this setting.

# 3 RELATED WORK

The idea of reducing communication overhead by using ALLREDUCE to synchronize parameters after every  $\tau > 0$  optimizer steps has been considered at least since the work of McDonald et al. (2010), and has been more recently referred to as Local SGD in the literature. Elastic-average SGD (Zhang et al., 2015) uses a related approach, but with a parameter server rather than ALLREDUCE. Lin et al. (2018) apply Local SGD for distributed training of deep neural networks and propose postlocal SGD, which starts by running ALLREDUCE-SGD for some epochs before switching to Local SGD, to improve generalization at the cost of additional communication.

Decentralized methods use approximate distributed averaging over a peer-to-peer topology, rather than ALLREDUCE. This decouples communication but also injects additional noise in the optimization process since the models at different workers are no longer precisely synchronized. Lian et al. (2017) present decentralized parallel SGD (D-PSGD), where each worker sends a copy of its model

to its peers at every iteration, and show it can be faster than parameter-server and ALLREDUCE methods for training deep neural networks. Lian et al. (2018) study an asynchronous extension, AD-PSGD. Assran et al. (2019) study stochastic gradient push (SGP), and propose its asynchronous counterpart overlap SGP (OSGP), which achieve a further speedup over D-PSGD and AD-PSGD by using less coupled communication. D-PSGD, AD-PSGD, and SGP all have similar theoretical convergence guarantees for smooth non-convex functions, showing a linear scaling relationship between the number of workers and the number of iterations to reach a neighborhood of a first-order stationary point. Although the theory for all three methods only covers the case of SGD updates without momentum, implementations use momentum locally at each worker, and workers only average their model parameters (not momentum buffers). Yu et al. (2019a) prove that linear scaling holds when workers average their parameters and momentum buffers, although this doubles the communication overhead. We refer to this approach as double-averaging below.

Mahajan et al. (2018a) propose an approach to distributed learning of linear classifiers (i.e., convex problems) where, in parallel, workers minimize locally formed approximate loss functions, and then the resulting minimizers are averaged to determine a descent direction. Methods which fit in the SLOWMo framework, including Local SGD, BMUF (Chen & Huo, 2016), and the serial Lookahead optimizer (Zhang et al., 2019), can be seen as related to this approach, where the actual loss function at each worker is used rather than an approximate one, and where the descent direction is used in a momentum update rather than a (deterministic) line search method.

Finally, we note that various approaches to gradient compression have been proposed to reduce the communication overhead for ALLREDUCE and decentralized learning methods (Alistarh et al., 2007; Wen et al., 2007; Bernstein et al., 2019; Karimireddy et al., 2019; Koloskova et al., 2019; Vogels et al., 2019). However, it is presently not clear to what extent compression may be beneficial for methods like Local SGD, BMUF, D-PSGD, SGP, and OSGP, which perform averaging on the model parameters rather than on gradients. Combining SLOWMo with compression techniques is an interesting and important direction for future work.

# 4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We evaluate the effectiveness of SLOWMo on three datasets: image classification on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and neural machine translation on WMT'16-En-De. All experiments use NVIDIA DGX-1 servers as worker nodes. Each server contains 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs and the servers are internetworked via commodity 10 Gbps Ethernet.

On CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), we train a ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) using 32 V100 GPUs, located on 32 different worker nodes. The total mini-batch size is 4096, and we train for 200 epochs. The learning rate  $(\gamma_{t})$  linearly increases during the first 5 epochs, following the warm-up strategy in Goyal et al. (2017), and then decays by a factor of 10 at epochs 100, 150, and 175. The (fast) learning rate was tuned separately for each base optimizer. All experiments were run 5 times with different random seeds, and the mean metrics are reported.

On ImageNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), we train a ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) using 32 worker nodes (i.e., 256 GPUs). The total mini-batch size is 8192, and we train for 90 epochs. The learning rate schedule is identical to (Goyal et al., 2017), i.e., linear warm-up in the first 5 epochs and decay by a factor of 10 at epochs 30, 60 and 80.

On WMT'16-En-De, we train a transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) using 8 worker nodes (i.e., 64 GPUs). The model is trained with 200k token batches, and we train for 25 epochs. We follow the experimental setting of Ott et al. (2018).

For each task, we consider several baselines: (i) Local SGD/Local Adam, where worker nodes independently run single-node SGD/Adam and periodically average model parameters; (ii) stochastic gradient push (SGP), the state-of-the-art synchronous decentralized training method; and (iii) Overlap-SGP (OSGP), an asynchronous version of SGP. For each baseline, we examine its performance with and without SLOWMo. Recall that Local SGD with SLOWMo is equivalent to BMUF. Local SGD and Local Adam do not involve communication during the inner loop (base optimizer) updates, while SGP and OSGP involve gossiping with one peer at every step. In addition, we also evaluate the performance of AR-SGD/AR-Adam, the traditional ALLREDUCE implementation of parallel SGD/Adam. Details of all baseline methods are provided in Appendices A and C.

Table 1: Comparisons to the original distributed optimization algorithms on various training tasks. The best training loss, validation accuracy (for image classification), and BLEU score (for machine translation) are reported. We fix slow learning rate  $\alpha = 1$ . We set the number of local steps  $\tau = 12$  for CIFAR10. For ImageNet and WMT, we use  $\tau = 48$  for SGP and OSGP and  $\tau = 12$  for Local SGD. The slow momentum  $\beta$  is tuned for each case. It typically ranges from 0.4 to 0.8.

In general, the hyperparameters of SLOWMo (slow learning rate  $\alpha$ , slow momentum  $\beta$ , and number of inner loop steps  $\tau$ ) need to be tuned for each base optimizer and task. The results in Table 1 all use  $\alpha = 1$ , which we found to be consistently the best. For Local SGD (with or without SLOWMo), we set  $\tau = 12$ , and for all other baseline methods we use  $\tau = 48$ . Using  $\tau > 12$  for Local SGD resulted in significantly worse loss/accuracy on ImageNet and WMT'16 En-De.

Some of the base algorithms use additional buffers; e.g., SGD with momentum, Adam. When using these methods with SLOWMO, there are different ways to handle the base algorithm buffers at the beginning of each outer loop (line 2 in Algorithm 1): zeroing, averaging among workers, or maintaining the current local value. Appendix B.4 provides an empirical comparison. For the experiments reported here, when using SGD with Nesterov momentum as the base algorithm (CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) we zero the base algorithm buffer, and when using Adam as the base algorithm (WMT'16 En-De) we maintain the current value of the Adam buffers. We also tried to apply SLOWMO on top of AR-SGD base optimizer, but we did not observe any improvement in that setting.

Optimization and Generalization Performance. Table 1 shows the best training loss and the validation accuracy/BLEU score for each baseline, with and without SLOWMo. Using SLOWMo consistently improves both the optimization and generalization performance across all training tasks and baseline algorithms. Figure 2 presents validation error/loss per epoch to give a sense of convergence speed. Observe that SGP with SLOWMo substantially improves convergence, compared to SGP alone. We observe a similar phenomenon when comparing the training curves; see Appendix B.

Communication Cost. Table 2 shows the average training time per iteration on ImageNet and WMT'16. For SGP/OSGP, since the additional communication cost due to averaging in line 6 of Algorithm 1 is amortized over  $\tau = 48$  iterations, SLOWMo maintains nearly the same speed as the corresponding base algorithm. For methods like Local SGD/Local Adam, which already compute an exact average every  $\tau$  iterations, using SlowMo (i.e., using  $\beta >0$ ) does not increase the amount of communication. In other words, using SLOWMo on top of the base algorithm improves training/validation accuracy at a negligible additional communication cost.

Effects of  $\tau$ . The most important hyper-parameter in SLOWMo is the number of base optimizer steps  $\tau$  before each SLOWMo update, since it influences both the accuracy and the training time. Figure 3 presents the validation accuracy and average iteration time of SGP-SLOWMo for different values of  $\tau$  on ImageNet and WMT'16. It can be observed that the validation performance does not monotonically increase or decrease with  $\tau$ . Instead, there is a best value. On both ImageNet and WMT'16, we find  $\tau = 48$  to be a good tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Moreover, SLOWMo is pretty robust to the choice of  $\tau$ ; even if  $\tau = 96$  for ImageNet and  $\tau = 192$  for WMT'16, SGP with SLOWMo achieves better validation accuracy/loss than SGP alone.

We further investigate the effect of other hyperparameters (the slow learning rate  $\alpha$ , slow momentum  $\beta$ ) as well as the different strategies for handling base algorithm buffers in Appendix B.

Comparison with Double-Averaging Momentum. As mentioned in Section 3, Yu et al. (2019a) propose an alternative momentum scheme, double-averaging, to improve the convergence of Local SGD and D-PSGD. We empirically compare it with SLOWMo in terms of the validation accuracy and average training time per iteration on ImageNet. When the base algorithm is SGP, double averaging achieves  $75.54\%$  validation accuracy and takes  $402~\mathrm{ms}$  per iteration on average, while SLOWMo-SGP  $(\tau = 48)$  reaches  $75.73\%$  validation accuracy while taking  $302~\mathrm{ms}$  per iteration on average. Similarly, when the baseline algorithm is Local SGD with  $\tau = 12$ , double-averaging

Figure 3: The effects of  $\tau$  in SLOWMo. We use SGP as the base algorithm. For ImageNet we plot validation accuracy (higher is better), and for WMT'16 En-De we plot validation NLL (lower is better). Increasing  $\tau$  amortizes communication cost over more iterations, so the average time per iteration decreases. We hypothesize that moderate values of  $\tau$  have a regularizing effect, improving loss and accuracy, and when  $\tau$  is too large performance is degraded because workers' local models drift too far apart.

reaches  $72.04\%$  and takes 405 ms per iteration, while SLOWMo reaches  $73.24\%$  and takes only 282 ms per iteration.

# 5 THEORETICAL RESULTS

This section provides a convergence guarantee for SLOWMO and shows that it can achieve a linear speedup in terms of number of workers. Let  $f_{i}(\pmb{x}) = \mathbb{E}_{\xi_{i} \sim D_{i}}[F_{i}(\pmb{x}; \xi_{i})]$  denote the expected objective function at worker  $i$ , and let  $f(\pmb{x}) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_{i}(\pmb{x})$ . Our analysis is conducted for a constant learning rate  $\gamma_{t} = \gamma$  under the following standard assumptions.

Assumption 1 (L-smooth). Each local objective function  $f_{i}(\pmb{x})$  is L-smooth, i.e.,  $\| \nabla f_{i}(\pmb{x}) - \nabla f_{i}(\pmb{y}) \| \leq L \| \pmb{x} - \pmb{y} \|$ , for all  $\pmb{x}, \pmb{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$  and  $i \in \{1,2,\dots,m\}$ .

Assumption 2 (Bounded variance). There exists a finite positive constant  $\sigma^2$  such that  $\mathbb{E}_{\xi \sim D_i}\| \nabla F_i(\pmb {x};\xi) - \nabla f_i(\pmb {x})\| ^2\leq \sigma^2$  , for all  $i\in \{1,2,\dots,m\}$

In order to generalize the analysis to various base algorithms, we define  $\pmb{d}_{t,k} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\pmb{d}_{t,k}^{(i)}$  as the average descent direction across the  $m$  workers and make the following assumption.

Assumption 3. There exists a finite positive constant  $V$  such that  $\mathbb{E}\| \pmb{d}_{t,k} - \mathbb{E}_{t,k}[\pmb{d}_{t,k}]\|^2 \leq V$ , where  $\mathbb{E}_{t,k}$  denotes expectation conditioned on all randomness from stochastic gradients up to the  $k$ -th step of  $t$ -th outer iteration.

As mentioned in Section 2, the analytic form of  $\pmb{d}_{t,k}$  depends on the choice of base algorithm. Therefore, the value of  $V$  also changes. For instance, when the base algorithm is Local-SGD, then  $\pmb{d}_{t,k} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\nabla F_i(\pmb{x}_{t,k}^{(i)};\xi_{t,k}^{(i)})$ . It follows that

$$
\mathbb {E} \left\| \boldsymbol {d} _ {t, k} - \mathbb {E} _ {t, k} \left[ \boldsymbol {d} _ {t, k} \right] \right\| ^ {2} = \frac {1}{m ^ {2}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \mathbb {E} \left\| \nabla F _ {i} \left(\boldsymbol {x} _ {t, k} ^ {(i)}; \xi_ {t, k} ^ {(i)}\right) - \nabla f _ {i} \left(\boldsymbol {x} _ {t, k} ^ {(i)}\right) \right\| ^ {2} \leq \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{m} = V. \tag {4}
$$

The above value  $(V = \sigma^2 /m)$  can also be applied to other base algorithms, such as D-PSGD, SGP, and OSGP. More details are provided in Appendix C.

Our main convergence result is stated next. Proofs of all results in this section appear in Appendix D.

Theorem 1 (General Result). Suppose all worker nodes start from the same initial point  $\pmb{x}_{0,0}$ , and the initial slow momentum is  $\pmb{u}_0 = \pmb{0}$ . If we set  $\alpha$ ,  $\beta$ ,  $\gamma_t = \gamma$ ,  $\tau$  and  $T$  so that  $\frac{\alpha\gamma}{1 - \beta} = \sqrt{\frac{m}{\tau T}}$  and the total iterations  $\tau T$  satisfies  $\tau T \geq mL^2\left(1 + \sqrt{3}\max \left\{\frac{3\tau(1 - \beta - \alpha)}{\alpha},\frac{4\tau\beta}{1 - \beta},1\right\}\right)$ , then under Assumptions 1 to 3, we have that:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1}{\tau T} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {T - 1} \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\tau - 1} \mathbb {E} \| \nabla f (\boldsymbol {x} _ {t, k}) \| ^ {2} \leq \frac {2 (f (\boldsymbol {x} _ {0 , 0}) - f _ {i n f}) + m V L}{\sqrt {m \tau T}} + \underbrace {\frac {1}{\tau T} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {T - 1} \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\tau - 1} \mathbb {E} \| \nabla f (\boldsymbol {x} _ {t , k}) - \mathbb {E} _ {t , k} [ \boldsymbol {d} _ {t , k} ] \| ^ {2}} _ {\text {E f f e c t o f b a s e o p t i m i z e r}} \\ + \underbrace {\frac {4 m V L ^ {2} (\tau - 1)}{\tau T} \left(\frac {1 - \beta}{\alpha} - 1\right) ^ {2} + \frac {8 m V L ^ {2} \tau}{\tau T} \frac {\beta^ {2}}{(1 - \beta^ {2})}} \tag {5} \\ \end{array}
$$

Effect of slow momentum

where  $f_{inf} = \inf_{\pmb{x}} f(\pmb{x})$

Consistent with AR-SGD. Recall that AR-SGD is equivalent to taking  $\tau = 1$ ,  $\alpha = 1$ , and  $\beta = 0$  and using SGD with learning rate  $\gamma$  as the base optimizer. In this case, all terms on the RHS but the first one vanish,  $V = \sigma^2 / m$ , and (5) is identical to the well-known rate of  $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{mT\tau})$  for SGD.

Effect of the base optimizer. The second term in (5) only depends on the base optimizer. It measures the bias between the full batch gradient  $\nabla f(\boldsymbol{x}_{t,k})$  and the expected update averaged across all workers  $\mathbb{E}_{t,k}[\boldsymbol{d}_{t,k}]$ . For the base optimizers considered in this paper, this term relates to the discrepancies among local models and can be easily found in previous distributed optimization literature. In particular, under the same assumptions as Theorem 1, one can show that this term vanishes in a rate of  $1/(T\tau)$  for D-PSGD, SGP, OSGP and Local-SGD; see Appendix C.

As an example, we provide the convergence analysis for the extreme case of Local SGD, where there is no communication between nodes during each inner iteration. Intuitively, using other base algorithms should only make this term smaller since they involve more communication than Local SGD.

Corollary 1 (Convergence of BMUF, i.e., Local SGD with SLOWMo). Under the same conditions as Theorem 1, if the inner algorithm is Local SGD and there exists a positive finite constant  $\zeta$  such that  $\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) - \nabla f_i(\mathbf{x})\|^2 \leq \zeta^2$ , then

$$
\frac {1}{\tau T} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {T - 1} \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\tau - 1} \mathbb {E} \| \nabla f (\boldsymbol {x} _ {t, k}) \| ^ {2} = \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {1}{\sqrt {m \tau T}}\right) + \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {m \tau}{T}\right). \tag {6}
$$

Linear speedup. Corollary 1 shows that when the total number of steps  $T\tau$  is sufficiently large:  $T \geq m^3\tau^3$ , the convergence rate will be dominated by the first term  $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{mT\tau})$ . That is, in order to achieve an  $\epsilon$  error, the algorithm requires  $m$  times less steps when using  $m$  times more worker nodes. This also recovers the same rate as AR-SGD.

Extension to single-node case. As mentioned in Section 2, when there is only one node and the slow momentum factor is  $\beta = 0$ , the SLOWMo-SGD is the Lookahead optimizer. One can directly apply Theorem 1 to this special case and get the following corollary.

Corollary 2 (Convergence of Lookahead). Under the same conditions as Theorem 1, if the inner optimizer is AR-SGD and  $\beta = 0$ , then one can obtain the following upper bound:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1}{\tau T} \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {T - 1} \sum_ {k = 0} ^ {\tau - 1} \mathbb {E} \| \nabla f (\boldsymbol {x} _ {t, k}) \| ^ {2} \leq \frac {2 (f (\boldsymbol {x} _ {0 , 0}) - f _ {i n f}) + \sigma^ {2} L}{\sqrt {\tau T}} + \frac {4 \sigma^ {2} L ^ {2} (\tau - 1)}{\tau T} \left(\frac {1}{\alpha} - 1\right) ^ {2} (7) \\ = \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {1}{\sqrt {\tau T}}\right) + \mathcal {O} \left(\frac {1}{T}\right). (8) \\ \end{array}
$$

# 6 FASTER SLOWMO: REMOVING THE PERIODIC ALLREDUCE

SLOWMo helps improve both the optimization and generalization of communication-efficient algorithms. When the base optimizer is SGP or OSGP, SLOWMo also comes at the expense of higher communication cost, since it requires performing an exact average every  $\tau$  iterations. Although the communication cost can be amortized, here we go one step further and propose a SGP-SLOWMo variant, named SGP-SLOWMo-noaverage, where we remove the exact average when we perform the SLOWMo update, i.e. we skip line 6 in Algorithm 1. We empirically evaluate this variant on the ImageNet and WMT'16 datasets, using  $\alpha = 1$ ,  $\beta = 0.6$  and  $\tau = 48$ .

Surprisingly, we observe that SGP-SLOWMo-noaverage achieves similar performances on Imagenet (75.78%, compared to 75.73% for SGP-SLOWMo) and only slightly degrades the validation NLL on WMT'16 (2.11, compared to 2.10), while preserving the iteration time of the base algorithm (298 ms per iteration on ImageNet and 1227 ms per iteration on WMT'16) since this variant does not require additional communication. These results suggest that the slow momentum updates, and not the momentum buffer synchronization, contribute the most to the performance gain of SLOWMo. We leave further investigation of SLOWMo-SGP-noaverage for future work.

# 7 CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we propose a general momentum framework, SLOWMo, for communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithms. SLOWMo can be built on the top of SGD, as well as decentralized methods, such as SGP and (asynchronous) OSGP. On three different deep learning tasks, we empirically show that SLOWMo consistently improves the optimization and generalization performance of the corresponding baseline algorithm while maintaining a similar level of communication efficiency. Moreover, we establish a convergence guarantee for SLOWMo, showing that it converges to a stationary point of smooth and non-convex objectives. Since BMUF (Chen & Huo, 2016) is a special case of SLOWMo (by choosing the base optimizer to be Local SGD), to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first convergence guarantee for BMUF in the literature.
