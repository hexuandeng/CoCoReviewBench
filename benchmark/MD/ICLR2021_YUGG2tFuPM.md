# ABSTRACT

Adversarial poisoning attacks distort training data in order to corrupt the test-time behavior of a classifier. A provable defense provides a certificate for each test sample, which is a lower bound on the magnitude of any adversarial distortion of the training set that can corrupt the test sample's classification. We propose two novel provable defenses against poisoning attacks: (i) Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA), a certified defense against a general poisoning threat model, defined as the insertion or deletion of a bounded number of samples to the training set — by implication, this threat model also includes arbitrary distortions to a bounded number of images and/or labels; and (ii) Semi-Supervised DPA (SS-DPA), a certified defense against label-flipping poisoning attacks. DPA is an ensemble method where base models are trained on partitions of the training set determined by a hash function. DPA is related to both subset aggregation, a well-studied ensemble method in classical machine learning, as well as to randomized smoothing, a popular provable defense against evasion (inference) attacks. Our defense against label-flipping poison attacks, SS-DPA, uses a semi-supervised learning algorithm as its base classifier model: each base classifier is trained using the entire unlabeled training set in addition to the labels for a partition. SS-DPA significantly outperforms the existing certified defense for label-flipping attacks (Rosenfeld et al., 2020) on both MNIST and CIFAR-10: provably tolerating, for at least half of test images, over 600 label flips (vs.  $< 200$  label flips) on MNIST and over 300 label flips (vs. 175 label flips) on CIFAR-10. Against general poisoning attacks where no prior certified defenses exist, DPA can certify  $\geq 50\%$  of test images against over 500 poison image insertions on MNIST, and nine insertions on CIFAR-10. These results establish new state-of-the-art provable defenses against general and label-flipping poison attacks.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Adversarial poisoning attacks are an important vulnerability in machine learning systems. In these attacks, an adversary can manipulate the training data of a classifier, in order to change the classifications of specific inputs at test time. Several poisoning threat models have been studied in the literature, including threat models where the adversary may insert new poison samples (Chen et al., 2017), manipulate the training labels (Xiao et al., 2012; Rosenfeld et al., 2020), or manipulate the training sample values (Biggio et al., 2012; Shafahi et al., 2018). A certified defense against a poisoning attack provides a certificate for each test sample, which is a guaranteed lower bound on the magnitude of any adversarial distortion of the training set that can corrupt the test sample's classification. In this work, we propose certified defenses against two types of poisoning attacks:

General poisoning attacks: In this threat model, the attacker can insert or remove a bounded number of samples from the training set. In particular, the attack magnitude  $\rho$  is defined as the cardinality of the symmetric difference between the clean and poisoned training sets. This threat model also includes any distortion to an image and/or label in the training set — a distortion of a training image is simply the removal of the original image followed by the insertion of the distorted image. (Note that an image distortion or label flip therefore increases the symmetric difference attack magnitude by two.)

Performance curves for Rosenfeld et al. (2020) are adapted from Figure 1 in that work. The parameter  $q$  is a hyperparameter of Rosenfeld et al. (2020)'s algorithm, and  $k$  is a hyperparameter of our algorithm: the number of base classifiers in an ensemble.

Rosenfeld et al. (2020) does not provide a provable defense for this more general case.

Label-flipping poisoning attacks: In this threat model, the adversary changes only the label for  $\rho$  out of  $m$  training samples. Rosenfeld et al. (2020) has recently provided a certified defense for this threat model, which we improve upon.

In the last couple of years, certified defenses have been extensively studied for evasion attacks, where the adversary manipulates the test images, rather than the training data (e.g. Wong & Kolter (2018); Gowal et al. (2018); Lecuyer et al. (2019); Li et al. (2018); Salman et al. (2019); Levine & Feizi (2020a; 2019); Cohen et al. (2019), etc.) In the evasion case, a certificate is a lower bound on the distance from the image to the classifier's decision boundary: this guarantees that the image's classification remains unchanged under adversarial distortions up to the certified magnitude.

Rosenfeld et al. (2020) provides an analogous certificate for label-flipping poisoning attacks: for an input image  $\mathbf{x}$ , the certificate of  $\mathbf{x}$  is a lower bound on the number of labels in the training set that would have to change in order to change the classification of  $\mathbf{x}$ . Rosenfeld et al. (2020)'s method is an adaptation of a certified defense for sparse  $(L_0)$  evasion attacks proposed by Lee et al. (2019). The adapted method for label-flipping attacks proposed by Rosenfeld et al. (2020) is equivalent to randomly flipping each training label with fixed probability and taking a consensus result. If implemented directly, this would require one to train a large ensemble of classifiers on different noisy versions of the training data. However, instead of actually doing this, Rosenfeld et al. (2020) focuses only on linear classifiers and is therefore able to analytically calculate the expected result. This gives deterministic, rather than probabilistic, certificates. Further, because Rosenfeld et al. (2020) considers a threat model where only labels are modified, they are able to train an unsupervised nonlinear feature extractor on the (unlabeled) training data before applying their technique, in order to learn more complex features.

Inspired by an improved provable defense against  $L_{0}$  evasion attacks (Levine & Feizi, 2020a), in this paper, we develop certifiable defenses against general and label-flipping poisoning attacks that significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art certifiable defenses. In particular, we develop a certifiable defense against general poisoning attacks called Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA) which is based on partitioning the training set into  $k$  partitions, with the partition assignment for a training sample determined by a hash function of the sample. The hash function can be any deterministic function that maps a training sample  $\mathbf{t}$  to a partition assignment: the only requirement is that the hash value depends only on the value of the training sample  $\mathbf{t}$  itself, so that neither poisoning other samples, nor changing the total number of samples, nor reordering the samples can change the partition that  $\mathbf{t}$  is assigned to. We then train  $k$  base classifiers separately, one on each partition. At the test time, we evaluate each of the base classifiers on the test image  $x$  and return the plurality classification  $c$  as the final result. The key insight is that removing a training sample, or adding a new sample, will only change the contents of one partition, and therefore will only affect the classification of one of the  $k$  base classifiers. This immediately leads to robustness certifications against general poisoning attacks which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first one of this kind.

If the adversary is restricted to flipping labels only (as in Rosenfeld et al. (2020)), we can achieve even larger certificates through a modified technique. In this setting, the unlabeled data is trustworthy: each base classifier in the ensemble can then make use of the entire training set without labels, but only has access to the labels in its own partition. Thus, each base classifier can be trained as if the entire dataset is available as unlabeled data, but only a very small number of labels are available. This is precisely the problem statement of semi-supervised learning (Verma et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2018; Laine & Aila, 2017; Kingma et al., 2014; Gidaris et al., 2018). We can then leverage these existing semi-supervised learning techniques directly to improve the accuracies of the base classifiers in DPA. Furthermore, we can ensure that a particular image is assigned to the same partition regardless of label, so that only one partition is affected by a label flip (rather than possibly two). The resulting algorithm, Semi-Supervised Deep Partition Aggregation (SS-DPA) yields substantially increased certified accuracy against label-flipping attacks, compared to DPA alone and compared to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, while our method is de-randomized (as Rosenfeld et al. (2020) is) and therefore yields deterministic certificates, our technique does not require that the classification model be linear, allowing deep networks to be used.

On MNIST, SS-DPA substantially outperforms the existing state of the art (Rosenfeld et al., 2020) in defending against label-flip attacks: we certify at least half of images in the test set against attacks to over 600 (1.0%) of the labels in the training set, while still maintaining over 93% accuracy (See Figure 1-a, and Table 1). In comparison, Rosenfeld et al. (2020)'s method achieves less than 60% clean accuracy on MNIST, and most test images cannot be certified with the correct class against attacks of even 200 label flips. We are also the first work to our knowledge to certify against general poisoning attacks, including insertions and deletions of new training images: in this domain, we can certify at least half of test images against attacks consisting of over 500 arbitrary training image insertions or deletions. On CIFAR-10, a substantially more difficult classification task, we can certify at least half of test images against label-flipping attacks on over 300 labels using SS-DPA (versus 175 label-flips for (Rosenfeld et al., 2020)), and can certify at least half of test images against general poisoning attacks of up to nine insertions or deletions using DPA. These results establish new state-of-the-art in provable defenses against label-flipping and general poisoning attacks.

# 2 RELATED WORKS

Levine & Feizi (2020a) propose a randomized ablation technique to certifiably defend against sparse attacks. Their method ablates some pixels, replacing them with a null value. Since it is possible for the base classifier to distinguish exactly which pixels originate from  $x$ , this results in more accurate base classifications and therefore substantially greater certified robustness than Lee et al. (2019). For example, on ImageNet, Lee et al. (2019) certifies the median test image against distortions of one pixel, while Levine & Feizi (2020a) certifies against distortions of 16 pixels.

Our proposed method is related to classical ensemble approaches in machine learning, namely bootstrap aggregation and subset aggregation (Breiman, 1996; Buja & Stuetzle, 2006; Buhlmann, 2003; Zaman & Hirose, 2009). However, in these methods each base classifier in the ensemble is trained on an independently sampled collection of points from the training set: multiple classifiers in the

ensemble may be trained on (and therefore poisoned by) the same sample point. The purpose of these methods has typically been to improve generalization. Bootstrap aggregation has been proposed as an empirical defense against poisoning attacks (Biggio et al., 2011) as well as for evasion attacks (Smutz & Stavrou, 2016). However, at the time of the initial distribution of this work, these techniques had not yet been used to provide certified robustness. Our unique partition aggregation variant provides deterministic robustness certificates against poisoning attacks. See Appendix D for further discussion.

Weber et al. (2020) have recently proposed a different randomized-smoothing based defense against poisoning attacks by directly applying Cohen et al. (2019)'s smoothing  $L_{2}$  evasion defense to the poisoning domain. The proposed technique can only certify for clean-label attacks (where only the existing images in the dataset are modified, and not their labels), and the certificate guarantees robustness only to bounded  $L_{2}$  distortions of the training data, where the  $L_{2}$  norm of the distortion is calculated across all pixels in the entire training set. Due to well-known limitations of dimensional scaling for smoothing-based robustness certificates (Yang et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2020), this yields certificates to only very small distortions of the training data. (For binary MNIST [13,007 images], the maximum reported  $L_{2}$  certificate is 2 pixels.) Additionally, when using deep classifiers, Weber et al. (2020) proposes a randomized certificate, rather than a deterministic one, with a failure probability that decreases to zero only as the number of trained classifiers in an ensemble approaches infinity. Moreover, in Weber et al. (2020), unlike in our method, each classifier in the ensemble must be trained on a noisy version of the entire dataset. These issues hinder Weber et al. (2020)'s method to be an effective scheme for certified robustness against poisoning attacks.

# 3 PROPOSED METHODS

# 3.1 NOTATION

Let  $S$  be the space of all possible unlabeled samples (i.e., the set of all possible images). We assume that it is possible to sort elements of  $S$  in a deterministic, unambiguous way. In particular, we can sort images lexicographically by pixel values: in general, any data that can be represented digitally will be sortable. We represent labels as integers, so that the set of all possible labeled samples is  $S_L := \{(\mathbf{x}, c) | \mathbf{x} \in S, c \in \mathbb{N}\}$ . A training set for a classifier is then represented as  $T \in \mathcal{P}(S_L)$ , where  $\mathcal{P}(S_L)$  is the power set of  $S_L$ . For  $t \in S_L$ , we let  $\text{sample}(t) \in S$  refer to the (unlabeled) sample, and  $\text{label}(t) \in \mathbb{N}$  refer to the label. For a set of samples  $T \in \mathcal{P}(S_L)$ , we let  $\text{samples}(T) \in \mathcal{P}(S)$  refer to the set of unique unlabeled samples which occur in  $T$ . A classifier model is defined as a deterministic function from both the training set and the sample to be classified to a label, i.e.  $f: \mathcal{P}(S_L) \times S \to \mathbb{N}$ . We will use  $f(\cdot)$  to represent a base classifier model (i.e., a neural network), and  $g(\cdot)$  to refer to a robust classifier (using DPA or SS-DPA).

$A \ominus B$  represents the set symmetric difference between  $A$  and  $B$ :  $A \ominus B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)$ . The number of elements in  $A$  is  $|A|$ ,  $[n]$  is the set of integers 1 through  $n$ , and  $\lfloor z \rfloor$  is the largest integer less than or equal to  $z$ .  $\mathbb{1}$  represents the indicator function:  $\mathbb{1}_{\mathrm{Prop}} = 1$  if Prop is true;  $\mathbb{1}_{\mathrm{Prop}} = 0$  otherwise. For a set  $A$  of sortable elements, we define  $\mathbf{Sort}(A)$  as the sorted list of elements. For a list  $L$  of unique elements, for  $l \in L$ , we will define  $\mathbf{index}(L, l)$  as the index of  $l$  in the list  $L$ .

# 3.2 DPA

The Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA) algorithm requires a base classifier model  $f: \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}_L) \times \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{N}$ , a training set  $T \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}_L)$ , a deterministic hash function  $h: \mathcal{S}_L \to \mathbb{N}$ , and a hyperparameter  $k \in \mathbb{N}$  indicating the number of base classifiers which will be used in the ensemble.

At the training time, the algorithm first uses the hash function  $h$  to define partitions  $P_{1},\ldots ,P_{k}\subseteq T$  of the training set, as follows:

$$
P _ {i} := \left\{\boldsymbol {t} \in T \mid h (\boldsymbol {t}) \equiv i \quad (\mathrm {m o d} k) \right\}. \tag {1}
$$

The hash function  $h$  can be any deterministic function from  $S_L$  to  $\mathbb{N}$ : however, it is preferable that the partitions are roughly equal in size. Therefore we should choose an  $h$  which maps images to

a domain of integers significantly larger than  $k$ , in a way such that  $h(\cdot) \pmod{k}$  will be roughly uniform over  $[k]$ . In practice, we let  $h(t)$  be the sum of the pixel values in the image  $t$ .

Base classifiers are then trained on each partition: we define trained base classifiers  $f_{i} : S \to \mathbb{N}$  as:

$$
f _ {i} (\boldsymbol {x}) := f \left(P _ {i}, \boldsymbol {x}\right). \tag {2}
$$

Finally, at the inference time, we evaluate the input on each base classification, and then count the number of classifiers which return each class:

$$
n _ {c} (\boldsymbol {x}) := | \left\{i \in [ k ] \mid f _ {i} (\boldsymbol {x}) = c \right\} |. \tag {3}
$$

This lets us define the classifier which returns the consensus output of the ensemble:

$$
g _ {\mathbf {d p a}} (T, \boldsymbol {x}) := \underset {c} {\arg \max } n _ {c} (\boldsymbol {x}). \tag {4}
$$

When taking the argmax, we break ties deterministically by returning the smaller class index. The resulting robust classifier has the following guarantee:

Theorem 1. For a fixed deterministic base classifier  $f$ , hash function  $h$ , ensemble size  $k$ , training set  $T$ , and input  $x$ , let:

$$
c := g _ {d p a} (T, \boldsymbol {x})
$$

$$
\bar {\rho} (\boldsymbol {x}) := \left\lfloor \frac {n _ {c} - \operatorname* {m a x} _ {c ^ {\prime} \neq c} \left(n _ {c ^ {\prime}} (\boldsymbol {x}) + \mathbb {1} _ {c ^ {\prime} <   c}\right)}{2} \right\rfloor . \tag {5}
$$

Then, for any poisoned training set  $U$ , if  $|T \ominus U| \leq \bar{\rho}(\pmb{x})$ , then  $g_{dpa}(U, \pmb{x}) = c$ .

All proofs are presented in Appendix A. Note that  $T$  and  $U$  are unordered sets: therefore, in addition to providing certified robustness against insertions or deletions of training data, the robust classifier  $g_{\mathbf{dpa}}$  is also invariant under re-ordering of the training data, provided that  $f$  has this invariance (which is implied, because  $f$  maps deterministically from a set; see Section 3.2.1 for practical considerations). As mentioned in Section 1, DPA is a deterministic variant of randomized ablation (Levine & Feizi, 2020a) adapted to the poisoning domain. Each base classifier ablates most of the training set, retaining only the samples in one partition. However, unlike in randomized ablation, the partitions are deterministic and use disjoint samples, rather than selecting them randomly and independently. In Appendix C, we argue that our derandomization has little effect on the certified accuracies, while allowing for exact certificates using finite samples. We also discuss how this work relates to Levine & Feizi (2020b), which proposes a de-randomized ablation technique for a restricted class of sparse evasion attacks (patch adversarial attacks).

# 3.2.1 DPA PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

One of the advantages of DPA is that we can use deep neural networks for the base classifier  $f$ . However, enforcing that the output of a deep neural network is a deterministic function of its training data, and specifically, its training data as an unordered set, requires some care. First, we must remove dependence on the order in which the training samples are read in. To do this, in each partition  $P_{i}$ , we sort the training samples prior to training, taking advantage of the assumption that  $S$  is well-ordered (and therefore  $S_{L} = S \times \mathbb{N}$  is also well ordered). In the case of the image data, this is implemented as a lexical sort by pixel values, with the labels concatenated to the samples as an additional value. The training procedure for the network, which is based on standard stochastic gradient descent, must also be made deterministic: in our PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) implementation, this can be accomplished by deterministically setting a random seed at the start of training. As discussed in Appendix F, we find that it is best for the final classifier accuracy to use different random seeds during training for each partition. This reduces the correlation in output between base classifiers in the ensemble. Thus, in practice, we use the partition index as the random seed (i.e., we train base classifier  $f_{i}$  using random seed  $i$ .

# 3.3 SS-DPA

Semi-Supervised DPA (SS-DPA) is a defense against label-flip attacks. In SS-DPA, the base classifier may be a semi-supervised learning algorithm: it can use the entire unlabeled training dataset, in addition to the labels for a partition. We will therefore define the base classifier to also accept an

unlabelled dataset as input:  $f:\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S})\times \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}_L)\times \mathcal{S}\to \mathbb{N}$ . Additionally, our method of partitioning the data is modified both to ensure that changing the label of a sample affects only one partition rather than possibly two, and to create a more equal distribution of samples between partitions.

First, we will sort the unlabeled data samples  $(T)$ :

$$
T _ {\text {s o r t e d}} := \operatorname {S o r t} (\operatorname {s a m p l e s} (T)). \tag {6}
$$

For a sample  $t \in T$ , note that  $\text{index}(T_{\text{sorted}}, \text{sample}(t))$  is invariant under any label-flipping attack to  $T$ , and also under permutation of the training data as they are read. We now partition the data based on sorted index:

$$
P _ {i} := \left\{\boldsymbol {t} \in T | \text {i n d e x} \left(T _ {\text {s o r t e d}}, \text {s a m p l e} (\boldsymbol {t})\right) \equiv i \quad (\mathrm {m o d} k) \right\}. \tag {7}
$$

Note that in this partitioning scheme, we no longer need to use a hash function  $h$ . Moreover, this scheme creates a more uniform distribution of samples between partitions, compared with the hashing scheme used in DPA. This can lead to improved certificates: see Appendix E. This sorting-based partitioning is possible because the unlabeled samples are "clean", so we can rely on their ordering, when sorted, to remain fixed. As in DPA, we train base classifiers on each partition, this time additionally using the entire unlabeled training set:

$$
f _ {i} (\boldsymbol {x}) := f \left(\text {s a m p l e s} (T), P _ {i}, \boldsymbol {x}\right). \tag {8}
$$

The inference procedure is the same as in the standard DPA:

$$
n _ {c} (\boldsymbol {x}) := | \{i \in [ k ] | f _ {i} (\boldsymbol {x}) = c \} |
$$

$$
g _ {\mathbf {s s d p a}} (T, \boldsymbol {x}) := \underset {c} {\arg \max } n _ {c} (\boldsymbol {x}) \tag {9}
$$

The SS-DPA algorithm provides the following robustness guarantee against label-flipping attacks.

Theorem 2. For a fixed deterministic semi-supervised base classifier  $f$ , ensemble size  $k$ , training set  $T$  (with no repeated samples), and input  $x$ , let:

$$
c := g _ {s s d p a} (T, \boldsymbol {x}),
$$

$$
\bar {\rho} (\boldsymbol {x}) := \left\lfloor \frac {n _ {c} - \max  _ {c ^ {\prime} \neq c} \left(n _ {c ^ {\prime}} (\boldsymbol {x}) + \mathbb {1} _ {c ^ {\prime} <   c}\right)}{2} \right\rfloor . \tag {10}
$$

For a poisoned training set  $U$  obtained by changing the labels of at most  $\bar{\rho}$  samples in  $T$ ,  $g_{ssdpa}(U, \boldsymbol{x}) = c$ .

# 3.3.1 SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS FOR SS-DPA

In the standard DPA algorithm, we are able to train each classifier in the ensemble using only a small fraction of the training data; this means that each classifier can be trained relatively quickly: as the number of classifiers increases, the time to train each classifier can decrease (see Table 1). However, in a naive implementation of SS-DPA, Equation 8 might suggest that training time will scale with  $k$ , because each semi-supervised base classifier requires to be trained on the entire training set. Indeed, with many popular and highly effective choices of semi-supervised classification algorithms, such as temporal ensembling (Laine & Aila, 2017), ICT (Verma et al., 2019), Teacher Graphs (Luo et al., 2018) and generative approaches (Kingma et al., 2014), the main training loop trains on both labeled and unlabeled samples, so we would see the total training time scale linearly with  $k$ . In order to avoid this, we instead choose a semi-supervised training method where the unlabeled samples are used only to learn semantic features of the data, before the labeled samples are introduced: this allows us to use the unlabeled samples only once, and to then share the learned feature representations when training each base classifier. In our experiments, we choose RotNet (Gidaris et al., 2018) for experiments on MNIST, and SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) for experiments on CIFAR-10. Both methods learn an unsupervised embedding of the training set, on top of which all classifiers in the ensemble can be learned. Note that Rosenfeld et al. (2020) also uses SimCLR for CIFAR-10 experiments. As discussed in Section 3.2.1, we also sort the data prior to learning (including when learning unsupervised features), and set random seeds, in order to ensure determinism.

Table 1: Summary statistics for DPA and SS-DPA algorithms on MNIST and CIFAR. Median Certified Robustness is the attack magnitude (symmetric difference for DPA, label flips for SS-DPA) at which certified accuracy is  $50\%$ . Training times are on a single GPU; note that many partitions can be trained in parallel. Note we observe some constant overhead time for training each classifier, so on MNIST, where the training time per image is small,  $k$  has little effect on the training time.

# 4 RESULTS

In this section, we present empirical results evaluating the performance of proposed methods, DPA and SS-DPA, against poison attacks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. As discussed in Section 3.3.1, we use the RotNet architecture (Gidaris et al., 2018) for SS-DPA's semi-supervised learning on MNIST. Conveniently, the RotNet architecture is structured such that the feature extracting layers, combined with the final classification layers, together make up the Network-In-Network (NiN) architecture for the supervised classification (Lin et al., 2013). Therefore, on MNIST, We use NiN for DPA's supervised training, and RotNet for SS-DPA's semi-supervised training. We use training parameters, for both the DPA (NiN) and SS-DPA (RotNet), directly from Gidaris et al. (2018), with a slight modification: we eliminate horizontal flips in data augmentation, because horizontal alignment is semantically meaningful for digits. On CIFAR-10, also use NiN (with full data augmentation) for DPA experiments. For SS-DPA, we use SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020), as (Rosenfeld et al., 2020) does, for semi-supervised learning. Hyperparameters are provided in Appendix H. Note that for SimCLR we use linear classifiers as the final, supervised classifiers for each partition.

Results are presented in Figures 2 and 3, and are summarized in Table 1. Our metric, Certified Accuracy as a function of attack magnitude (symmetric-difference or label-flips), refers to the fraction of samples which are both correctly classified and are certified as robust to attacks of that magnitude. Note that different poisoning perturbations, which poison different sets of training samples, may be required to poison each test sample; i.e. we assume the attacker can use the attack budget separately for each test sample. Table 1 also reports Median Certified Robustness, the attack magnitude to which at least  $50\%$  of the test set is provably robust.

Our SS-DPA method substantially outperforms the existing certificate (Rosenfeld et al., 2020) on label-flipping attacks: in median, 392 label flips on CIFAR-10, versus 175; 647 label flips on MNIST, versus  $< 200$ . With DPA, we are also able to certify at least half of MNIST images to attacks of over 500 poisoning insertions or deletions, and can certify at least half of CIFAR-10 images to 9 poisoning insertions or deletions

The hyperparameter  $k$  controls the number of classifiers in the ensemble: because each sample is used in training exactly one classifier, the average number of samples used to train each classifier is inversely proportional to  $k$ . Therefore, we observe that the base classifier accuracy (and therefore also the final ensemble classifier accuracy) decreases as  $k$  is increased; see Table 1. However, because the certificates described in Theorems 1 and 2 depend directly on the gap in the number of

classifiers in the ensemble which output the top and runner-up classes, larger numbers of classifiers are necessary to achieve large certificates. In fact, using  $k$  classifiers, the largest certified robustness possible is  $k / 2$ . Thus, we see in Figures 2 and 3 that larger values of  $k$  tend to produce larger robustness certificates. Therefore  $k$  controls a trade-off between robustness and accuracy.

Rosenfeld et al. (2020) also reports robustness certificates against label-flipping attacks on binary MNIST classification, with classes 1 and 7. Rosenfeld et al. (2020) reports clean-accuracy of  $94.5\%$  and certified accuracies for attack magnitudes up to 2000 label flips (out of 13007), with best certified accuracy less than  $70\%$ . By contrast, using a specialized form of SS-DPA, we are able to achieve clean accuracy of  $95.5\%$ , with every correctly-classified image certifiably robust up to 5952 label flips (i.e. certified accuracy is also  $95.5\%$  at 5952 label flips.) See Appendix B for discussion.

# 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we described a novel approach to provable defenses against poisoning attacks. Unlike previous techniques, our method both allows for exact, deterministic certificates and can be implemented using deep neural networks. These advantages allow us to outperform the current state-of-the-art on label-flip attacks, and to develop the first certified defense against a broadly defined class of general poisoning attacks.
