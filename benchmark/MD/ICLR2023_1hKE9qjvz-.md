# ABSTRACT

Our goal is to extend the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to general diffusion models (DMs) besides isotropic diffusions. Instead of constructing a non-Markov noisig process as in the original DDIM, we examine the mechanism of DDIM from a numerical perspective. We discover that the DDIM can be obtained by using some specific approximations of the score when solving the corresponding stochastic differential equation. We present an interpretation of the accelerating effects of DDIM that also explains the advantages of a deterministic sampling scheme over the stochastic one for fast sampling. Building on this insight, we extend DDIM to general DMs, coined generalized DDIM (gDDIM), with a small but delicate modification in parameterizing the score network. We validate gDDIM in two non-isotropic DMs: Blurring diffusion model (BDM) and Critically-damped Langevin diffusion model (CLD). We observe more than 20 times acceleration in BDM. In the CLD, a diffusion model by augmenting the diffusion process with velocity, our algorithm achieves an FID score of 2.26, on CIFAR10, with only 50 number of score function evaluations (NFEs) and an FID score of 2.86 with only 27 NFEs.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Generative models based on diffusion models (DMs) have experienced rapid developments in the past few years and show competitive sample quality compared with generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Ramesh et al.; Rombach et al., 2021), competitive negative log likelihood compared with autoregressive models in various domains and tasks (Song et al., 2021; Kawar et al., 2021). Besides, DMs enjoy other merits such as stable and scalable training, and mode-collapsing resiliency (Song et al., 2021; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021). However, slow and expensive sampling prevents DMs from further application in more complex and higher dimension tasks. Once trained, GANs only forward pass neural networks once to generate samples, but the vanilla sampling method of DMs needs 1000 or even 4000 steps (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020b) to pull noise back to the data distribution, which means thousands of neural networks forward evaluations. Therefore, the generation process of DMs is several orders of magnitude slower than GANs.

How to speed up sampling of DMs has received significant attention. Building on the seminal work by Song et al. (2020b) on the connection between stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and diffusion models, several studies investigate new forward SDEs for the forward noising scheme hoping to achieve more efficient sampling. A remarkable work by Dockhorn et al. (2021), critically-damped Langevin diffusion (CLD), proposes a velocity-augmented diffusion process and shows improved denoising efficiency. More recently, Hoogeboom & Salimans (2022); Rissanen et al. (2022) design Blurring diffusion models (BDM) which equip DMs with inductive bias inspired by heat dissipation. However, most methods along this line still need hundreds of steps to generate high-fidelity samples. Another promising strategy is based on probability flows (Song et al., 2020b), which are ordinary differential equations (ODE) associated with DMs that share equivalent marginal with SDE. Simple plug-in of off-the-shelf ODE solvers can already achieve significant acceleration compared to SDEs-based methods (Song et al., 2020b). The arguably most popular sampling method is denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) (Song et al., 2020a), which includes both deterministic and stochastic samplers, and both show tremendous improvement in sampling quality compared with previous methods when only a small number of steps is used for the generation. Deterministic

DDIM in fact reduces to probability flow in the infinitesimal step size limit (Song et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2022). Meanwhile, various approaches have been proposed to accelerate DDIM (Kong & Ping, 2021b; Watson et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022). Recently, Zhang & Chen (2022) discovered deterministic DDIM is an ODE numerical integrator based on exponential integrator, and employed high order ODE methods to further boost the efficiency of the ODE solver. (More related works in App. A.)

Although significant improvements of the DDIM in sampling efficiency have been observed empirically, the understanding of the mechanism of the DDIM is still lacking. First, why does solving probability flow ODE provide much higher sample quality than solving SDEs, when the number of steps is small? Second, it is shown that stochastic DDIM reduces to marginal-equivalent SDE (Zhang & Chen, 2022), but its discretization scheme and mechanism of acceleration are still unclear. Finally, can we generalize DDIMs to other DMs and achieve similar or even better acceleration results?

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to answer the above questions, so that we can generalize and improve DDIM. We start with an interesting observation that the DDIM can solve corresponding SDEs/ODE exactly without any discretization error in finite or even one step when the training dataset consists of only one data point. For deterministic DDIM, we find that the added noise in perturbed data along the diffusion is constant along an exact solution of probability flow ODE (see Prop 1). Besides, provided only one evaluation of log density gradient (a.k.a. score), we are already able to recover accurate score information for any datapoints, and this explains the acceleration of stochastic DDIM for SDEs (see Prop 3). Based on this observation, together with the manifold hypothesis, we present one possible interpretation to explain why the discretization scheme used in DDIMs is effective on realistic datasets (see Fig. 2). Equipped with this new interpretation, we extend DDIM to general DMs, which we coin generalized DDIM (gDDIM). With only a small but delicate change of the model parameterization, gDDIM can accelerate DMs based on general diffusion processes. Specifically, we verify the sampling quality of gDDIM on BDM and CLD in terms of Fréchet inception distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017).

To summarize, we have made the following contributions: 1) We provide an interpretation for the DDIM and unravel its mechanism. 2) The interpretation not only justifies the numerical discretization of DDIMs but also provides insights into why ODE-based samplers are preferred over SDE-based samplers when NFE is low. 3) We propose gDDIM, a generalized DDIM that can accelerate a large class of DMs deterministically and stochastically. 4) We show by extensive experiments that gDDIM can drastically improve sampling quality/efficiency almost for free. Specifically, when applied to CLD, gDDIM can achieve an FID score of 2.86 with only 27 steps and 2.26 with 50 steps. gDDIM has more than 20 times acceleration on BDM compared with the original samplers.

# 2 BACKGROUND

In this section, we provide a brief introduction to diffusion models (DMs). Most DMs are built on two diffusion processes in continuous-time, one forward diffusion known as the noising process that drives any data distribution to a tractable distribution such as Gaussian by gradually adding noise to the data, and one backward diffusion known as the denoising process that sequentially removes noise from noised data to generate realistic samples. The continuous-time noising and denoising processes are modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) (Särkkä & Solin, 2019).

In particular, the forward diffusion is a linear SDE with state  $\pmb{u}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$

$$
d \boldsymbol {u} = \boldsymbol {F} _ {t} \boldsymbol {u} d t + \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} d \boldsymbol {w}, t \in [ 0, T ] \tag {1}
$$

where  $\pmb{F}_t, \pmb{G}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}$  represent the linear drift coefficient and diffusion coefficient respectively, and  $\pmb{w}$  is a standard Wiener process. When the coefficients are piece-wise continuous, Eq. (1) admits a unique solution (Oksendal, 2013). Denote by  $p_t(\pmb{u})$  the distribution of the solutions  $\{\pmb{u}(t)\}_{0 \leq t \leq T}$  (simulated trajectories) to Eq. (1) at time  $t$ , then  $p_0$  is determined by the data distribution and  $p_T$  is a (approximate) Gaussian distribution. That is, the forward diffusion Eq. (1) starts as a data sample and ends as a Gaussian random variable. This can be achieved with properly chosen coefficients  $\pmb{F}_t, \pmb{G}_t$ . Thanks to linearity of Eq. (1), the transition probability  $p_{st}(\pmb{u}(t) | \pmb{u}(s))$  from  $\pmb{u}(s)$  to  $\pmb{u}(t)$  is a Gaussian distribution. For convenience, denote  $p_{0t}(\pmb{u}(t) | \pmb{u}(0))$  by  $\mathcal{N}(\mu_t \pmb{u}(0), \Sigma_t)$  where  $\mu_t, \Sigma_t \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}$ .

Pixel value and output of  $\epsilon_\theta$  in  $\pmb{v}$  channel with choice  $\pmb{K}_t = \pmb{L}_t$  (Dockhorn et al., 2021) along the trajectory (Mid). Output of  $\epsilon_\theta$  in  $\pmb{x}$ ,  $\pmb{v}$  channels with choice  $\pmb{K}_t = \pmb{R}_t$  (Right). The smooth network output along trajectories enables large stepsize and thus sampling acceleration. gDDIM based on the proper parameterization of  $\pmb{K}_t$  can accelerate more than 50 times compared with the naive Euler solver (Lower row).

The backward process from  $\pmb{u}(T)$  to  $\pmb{u}(0)$  of Eq. (1) is the denoising process. Remarkably, it can be characterized by the backward SDE simulated in reverse-time direction (Song et al., 2020b; Anderson, 1982)

$$
d \boldsymbol {u} = \left[ \boldsymbol {F} _ {t} \boldsymbol {u} d t - \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} ^ {T} \nabla \log p _ {t} (\boldsymbol {u}) \right] d t + \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} d \bar {\boldsymbol {w}}, \tag {2}
$$

where  $\bar{w}$  denotes a standard Wiener process running backward in time. Here  $\nabla \log p_t(\pmb{u})$  is known as the score function. When Eq. (2) is initialized with  $\pmb{u}(T) \sim p_T$ , the distribution of the simulated trajectories coincides with that of the forward diffusion Eq. (1). Thus,  $\pmb{u}(0)$  of these trajectories are unbiased samples from  $p_0$ ; the backward diffusion Eq. (2) is an ideal generative model.

In general, the score function  $\nabla \log p_t(\pmb{u})$  is not accessible. In diffusion-based generative models, a time-dependent network  $s_\theta(\pmb{u}, t)$ , known as the score network, is used to fit the score  $\nabla \log p_t(\pmb{u})$ . One effective approach to train  $s_\theta(\pmb{u}, t)$  is the denoising score matching (DSM) technique (Song et al., 2020b; Ho et al., 2020; Vincent, 2011) that seeks to minimize the DSM loss

$$
\mathbb {E} _ {t \sim \mathcal {U} [ 0, T ]} \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {u} (0), \boldsymbol {u} (t) | \boldsymbol {u} (0)} \left[ \| \nabla \log p _ {0 t} (\boldsymbol {u} (t) | \boldsymbol {u} (0)) - \boldsymbol {s} _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u} (t), t) \| _ {\Lambda_ {t}} ^ {2} \right], \tag {3}
$$

where  $\mathcal{U}[0,T]$  represents the uniform distribution over the interval  $[0,T]$ . The time-dependent weight  $\Lambda_{t}$  is chosen to balance the trade-off between sample fidelity and data likelihood of learned generative model (Song et al., 2021). It is discovered in Ho et al. (2020) that reparameterizing the score network by

$$
\boldsymbol {s} _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u}, t) = - \boldsymbol {K} _ {t} ^ {- T} \epsilon_ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u}, t) \tag {4}
$$

with  $\pmb{K}_t\pmb{K}_t^T = \Sigma_t$  leads to better sampling quality. In this parameterization, the network tries to predict directly the noise added to perturb the original data. Invoking the expression  $\mathcal{N}(\mu_t\pmb{u}(0),\Sigma_t)$  of  $p_{0t}(\pmb{u}(t)|\pmb{u}(0))$ , this parameterization results in the new DSM loss

$$
\mathcal {L} (\theta) = \mathbb {E} _ {t \sim \mathcal {U} [ 0, T ]} \mathbb {E} _ {\boldsymbol {u} (0) \sim p _ {0}, \epsilon \sim \mathcal {N} (0, I _ {D})} [ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_ {\theta} (\mu_ {t} \boldsymbol {u} (0) + \boldsymbol {K} _ {t} \epsilon , t) \| _ {\boldsymbol {K} _ {t} ^ {- 1} \Lambda_ {t} \boldsymbol {K} _ {t} ^ {- T}} ^ {2} ]. \tag {5}
$$

Sampling: After the score network  $s_{\theta}$  is trained, one can generate samples via the backward SDE Eq. (2) with a learned score, or the marginal equivalent SDE/ODE (Song et al., 2020b; Zhang &

Chen, 2021; 2022)

$$
d \boldsymbol {u} = \left[ \boldsymbol {F} _ {t} \boldsymbol {u} - \frac {1 + \lambda^ {2}}{2} \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {s} _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u}, t) \right] d t + \lambda \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} d \boldsymbol {w}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\lambda \geq 0$  is a free parameter. Regardless of the value of  $\lambda$ , the exact solutions to Eq. (6) produce unbiased samples from  $p_0(\boldsymbol{u})$  if  $\boldsymbol{s}_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u},t) = \nabla \log p_t(\boldsymbol{u})$  for all  $t,\boldsymbol{u}$ . When  $\lambda = 1$ , Eq. (6) reduces to reverse-time diffusion in Eq. (2). When  $\lambda = 0$ , Eq. (6) is known as the probability flow ODE (Song et al., 2020b)

$$
d \boldsymbol {u} = \left[ \boldsymbol {F} _ {t} \boldsymbol {u} - \frac {1}{2} \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {s} _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u}, t) \right] d t. \tag {7}
$$

Isotropic diffusion and DDIM: Most existing DMs are isotropic diffusions. A popular DM is the Denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM) (Ho et al., 2020). For a given data distribution  $p_{\mathrm{data}}(\boldsymbol{x})$ , DDPM has state  $\boldsymbol{u} = \boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$  and sets  $p_0(\boldsymbol{u}) = p_{\mathrm{data}}(\boldsymbol{x})$ . Though originally proposed in the discrete-time setting, DDPM can be viewed as a discretization of a continuous-time SDE with parameters

$$
\boldsymbol {F} _ {t} := \frac {1}{2} \frac {d \log \alpha_ {t}}{d t} \boldsymbol {I} _ {d}, \quad \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} := \sqrt {- \frac {d \log \alpha_ {t}}{d t}} \boldsymbol {I} _ {d} \tag {8}
$$

for a decreasing scalar function  $\alpha_{t}$  satisfying  $\alpha_0 = 1, \alpha_T = 0$ . Here  $\pmb{I}_d$  represents the identity matrix of dimension  $d$ . For this SDE,  $\pmb{K}_{t}$  is always chosen to be  $\sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \pmb{I}_d$ .

The sampling scheme proposed in DDPM is inefficient; it requires hundreds or even thousands of steps, and thus number of score function evaluations (NFEs), to generate realistic samples. A more efficient alternative is the Denoising diffusion implicit modeling (DDIM) proposed in Song et al. (2020a). It has a similar training loss Eq. (5) as DDPM but a different sampling scheme over a grid  $\{t_i\}$

$$
\boldsymbol {x} \left(t _ {i - 1}\right) = \sqrt {\frac {\alpha_ {t _ {i - 1}}}{\alpha_ {t _ {i}}}} \boldsymbol {x} \left(t _ {i}\right) + \left(\sqrt {1 - \alpha_ {t _ {i - 1}} - \sigma_ {t _ {i}} ^ {2}} - \sqrt {1 - \alpha_ {t _ {i}}} \sqrt {\frac {\alpha_ {t _ {i - 1}}}{\alpha_ {t _ {i}}}}\right) \epsilon_ {\theta} \left(\boldsymbol {x} \left(t _ {i}\right), t _ {i}\right) + \sigma_ {t _ {i}} \epsilon , \tag {9}
$$

where  $\{\sigma_{t_i}\}$  are hyperparameters and  $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$ . DDIM can generate reasonable samples within 50 NFEs. For the special case where  $\sigma_{t_i} = 0$ , it is recently discovered in Zhang & Chen (2022) that Eq. (9) coincides with the numerical solution to Eq. (7) using an advanced discretization scheme known as the exponential integrator (EI) that utilizes the semi-linear structure of Eq. (7).

CLD and BDM: Dockhorn et al. (2021) propose critically-damped Langevin diffusion (CLD), a DM based on an augmented diffusion with an auxiliary velocity term. More specifically, the state of the diffusion in CLD is of the form  $\pmb{u}(t) = [\pmb{x}(t),\pmb{v}(t)]\in \mathbb{R}^{2d}$  with velocity variable  $\pmb{v}(t)\in \mathbb{R}^d$ . The CLD employs the forward diffusion Eq. (1) with coefficients

$$
\boldsymbol {F} _ {t} := \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & \beta M ^ {- 1} \\ \beta & - \Gamma \beta M ^ {- 1} \end{array} \right] \otimes \boldsymbol {I} _ {d}, \quad \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} := \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & - \Gamma \beta M ^ {- 1} \end{array} \right] \otimes \boldsymbol {I} _ {d}. \tag {10}
$$

Here  $\Gamma > 0, \beta > 0, M > 0$  are hyperparameters. Compared with most other DMs such as DDPM that inject noise to the data state  $\pmb{x}$  directly, the CLD introduces noise to the data state  $\pmb{x}$  through the coupling between  $\pmb{v}$  and  $\pmb{x}$  as the noise only affects the velocity component  $\pmb{v}$  directly. Another interesting DM is Blurring diffusion model (BDM) (Hoogeboom & Salimans, 2022). It can be shown the forward process in BDM can be formulated as a SDE with (Detailed derivation in App. B)

$$
\boldsymbol {F} _ {t} := \frac {d \log [ \boldsymbol {V} \boldsymbol {\alpha} _ {t} \boldsymbol {V} ^ {T} ]}{d t}, \quad \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} := \sqrt {\frac {d \boldsymbol {\sigma} _ {t} ^ {2}}{d t} - \boldsymbol {F} _ {t} \boldsymbol {\sigma} _ {t} ^ {2} - \boldsymbol {\sigma} _ {t} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {F} _ {t}}, \tag {11}
$$

where  $\mathbf{V}^T$  denotes a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and  $\mathbf{V}$  denotes the Inverse DCT. Diagonal matrices  $\alpha_{t},\sigma_{t}$  are determined by frequencies information and dissipation time. Though it is argued that inductive bias in CLD and BDM can benefit diffusion model (Dockhorn et al., 2021; Hoogeboom & Salimans, 2022), non-isotropic DMs are not easy to accelerate. Compared with DDPM, CLD introduces significant oscillation due to  $x - v$  coupling while only inefficient ancestral sampling algorithm support BDM (Hoogeboom & Salimans, 2022).

# 3 REVISIT DDIM: GAP BETWEEN THE EXACT SOLUTION AND NUMERICAL SOLUTION

The complexity of sampling from a DM is proportional to the NFEs used to numerically solve Eq. (6). To establish a sampling algorithm with a small NFEs, we ask the bold question:

Can we generate samples exactly from a DM with finite steps if the score function is precise?

To gain some insights to this question, we start with the simplest scenario where the training dataset consists of only one data point  $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ . It turns out that accurate sampling from diffusion models on this toy example is not that easy, even if the exact score function is accessible. Most well-known numerical methods for Eq. (6), such as Euler integrator and Runge Kutta (RK) for ODE, Euler-Maruyama (EM) for SDE, are accompanied by discretization error and cannot recover the single data point in the training set unless an infinite number of steps are used. Indeed, in general, the exact solution to Eq. (6) requires the score information along the entire continuous-time solution trajectory while any numerical method can only evaluate the score function finite times. Surprisingly, as we show below, DDIMs can recover the single data point in this toy example in finite steps (in fact, in one step).

ODE sampling: We first consider the deterministic DDIM, that is, Eq. (9) with  $\sigma_{t_i} = 0$ . In view of Eq. (8), the score network Eq. (4) is  $s_\theta(\boldsymbol{u}, t) = -\frac{\epsilon_\theta(\boldsymbol{u}, t)}{\sqrt{1 - \alpha_t}}$ . To differentiate between the learned score and the real score, denote the ground truth version of  $\epsilon_\theta$  by  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GT}}$ . In our toy example, the following property holds for  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GT}}$ .

Proposition 1. Assume  $p_0(\pmb{u})$  is a Dirac distribution. Let  $\pmb{u}(t)$  be an arbitrary solution to the probability flow ODE Eq. (7) with coefficient Eq. (8) and the ground truth score, then  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GT}}(\pmb{u}(t), t) = -\sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \nabla \log p_t(\pmb{u}(t))$  remains constant, which is  $\nabla \log p_T(\pmb{u}(T))$ , along  $\pmb{u}(t)$ .

We remark that even though  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GT}}(\pmb {u}(t),t)$  remains constant along an exact solution, the score  $\nabla \log p_t(\pmb {u}(t))$  is time-varying. This underscores the advantage of the parameterization  $\epsilon_{\theta}$  over  $s_\theta$ . Inspired by Prop 1, we devise a sampling algorithm as follows that can recover the exact data point in one step for our toy example. This algorithm turns out to coincide with the deterministic DDIM.

Proposition 2. With the parameterization  $s_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau) = -\frac{\epsilon_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau)}{\sqrt{1 - \alpha_{\tau}}}$  and the approximation  $\epsilon_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau) \approx \epsilon_{\theta}(\pmb{u}(t), t)$  for  $\tau \in [t - \Delta t, t]$ , the solution to the probability flow ODE Eq. (7) with coefficient Eq. (8) is

$$
\boldsymbol {u} (t - \Delta t) = \sqrt {\frac {\alpha_ {t - \Delta t}}{\alpha_ {t}}} \boldsymbol {u} (t) + (\sqrt {1 - \alpha_ {t - \Delta t}} - \sqrt {1 - \alpha_ {t}} \sqrt {\frac {\alpha_ {t - \Delta t}}{\alpha_ {t}}}) \epsilon_ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u} (t), t), \tag {12}
$$

which coincides with deterministic DDIM.

When  $\epsilon_{\theta} = \epsilon_{\mathrm{GT}}$  as is the case in our toy example, there is no approximation error in Prop 2 and Eq. (12) is precise. This implies that deterministic DDIM can recover the training data in one step in our example. The update Eq. (12) corresponds to a numerical method known as the exponential integrator to the probability flow ODE Eq. (7) with coefficient Eq. (8) and parameterization  $s_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u},\tau) = -\frac{\epsilon_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u},\tau)}{\sqrt{1 - \alpha_{\tau}}}$ . This strategy is used and developed recently in Zhang & Chen (2022). Prop 1 and toy experiments in Fig. 2 provide sights on why such a strategy should work.

SDE sampling: The above discussions however do not hold for stochastic cases where  $\lambda > 0$  in Eq. (6) and  $\sigma_{t_i} > 0$  in Eq. (9). Since the solutions to Eq. (6) from  $t = T$  to  $t = 0$  are stochastic, neither  $\nabla \log p_t(\boldsymbol{u}(t))$  nor  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GT}}(\boldsymbol{u}(t), t)$  remains constant along sampled trajectories; both are affected by the stochastic noise. The denoising SDE Eq. (6) is more challenging compared with the probability ODE since it injects additional noise to  $\boldsymbol{u}(t)$ . The score information needs to remove not only noise presented in  $\boldsymbol{u}(T)$  but also injected noise along the diffusion. In general, one evaluation of  $\epsilon_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u}, t)$  can only provide the information to remove noise in the current state  $\boldsymbol{u}$ ; it cannot predict the future injected noise. Can we do better? The answer is affirmative on our toy dataset. Given only one score evaluation, it turns out that score at any point can be recovered.

Proposition 3. Assume SDE coefficients Eq. (8) and that  $p_0(\pmb{u})$  is a Dirac distribution. Given any evaluation of the score function  $\nabla \log p_s(\pmb{u}(s))$ , one can recover  $\nabla \log p_t(\pmb{u})$  for any  $t, \pmb{u}$  as

$$
\nabla \log p _ {t} (\boldsymbol {u}) = \frac {1 - \alpha_ {s}}{1 - \alpha_ {t}} \sqrt {\frac {\alpha_ {t}}{\alpha_ {s}}} \nabla \log p _ {s} (\boldsymbol {u} (s)) - \frac {1}{1 - \alpha_ {t}} (\boldsymbol {u} - \sqrt {\frac {\alpha_ {t}}{\alpha_ {s}}} \boldsymbol {u} (s)). \tag {13}
$$

Figure 2: Manifold hypothesis and Dirac distribution assumption. We model an image dataset as a mixture of well-separated Dirac distribution and visualize the diffusion process on the left. Curves in red indicate high density area spanned by  $p_{0t}(\boldsymbol{u}(t) | \boldsymbol{u}(0))$  by different mode and region surrounded by them indicates the phase when  $p_t(\boldsymbol{u})$  is dominated by one mode while region surrounded by blue one is for the mixing phase, and green region indicates fully mixed phase. On the right, sampling trajectories depict smoothness of  $\epsilon_{GT}$  along ODE solutions, which justifies approximations used in DDIM and partially explains its empirical acceleration.

The major difference between Prop 3 and Prop 1 is that Eq. (13) retains the dependence of the score over the state  $\mathbf{u}$ . This dependence is important in canceling the injected noise in the denoising SDE Eq. (6). This approximation Eq. (13) turns out to lead to a numerical scheme for Eq. (6) that coincide with the stochastic DDIM.

Theorem 1. Given the parameterization  $s_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau) = -\frac{\epsilon_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau)}{\sqrt{1 - \alpha_{\tau}}}$  and the approximation  $s_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau) \approx \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{1 - \alpha_\tau} \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_\tau}{\alpha_t}} s_{\theta}(\pmb{u}(t), t) - \frac{1}{1 - \alpha_\tau} (\pmb{u} - \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_\tau}{\alpha_t}} \pmb{u}(t))$  for  $\tau \in [t - \Delta t, t]$ , the exact solution  $\pmb{u}(t - \Delta t)$  to Eq. (6) with coefficient Eq. (8) is

$$
\boldsymbol {u} (t - \Delta t) \sim \mathcal {N} \left(\sqrt {\frac {\alpha_ {t - \Delta t}}{\alpha_ {t}}} \boldsymbol {u} (t) + \left[ - \sqrt {\frac {\alpha_ {t - \Delta t}}{\alpha_ {t}}} \sqrt {1 - \alpha_ {t}} + \sqrt {1 - \alpha_ {t - \Delta t} - \sigma_ {t} ^ {2}} \right] \epsilon_ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u} (t), t), \sigma_ {t} ^ {2} \boldsymbol {I} _ {d}\right) \tag {14}
$$

with  $\sigma_{t} = (1 - \alpha_{t - \Delta t})\left[1 - \left(\frac{1 - \alpha_{t - \Delta t}}{1 - \alpha_{t}}\right)^{\lambda^{2}}\left(\frac{\alpha_{t}}{\alpha_{t - \Delta t}}\right)^{\lambda^{2}}\right]$ , which is the same as the DDIM Eq. (9).

Note that Thm 1 with  $\lambda = 0$  agrees with Prop 2; both reproduce the deterministic DDIM but with different derivations. In summary, DDIMs can be derived by utilizing local approximations.

Dirac  $p_0(u)$  and the manifold hypothesis: While Prop 1 and Prop 3 require the strong assumption that the data distribution is a Dirac, DDIMs work very effectively on realistic datasets, which may contain millions of datapoints (Nichol et al., 2021). Here we present one possible interpretation based on the manifold hypothesis (Roweis & Saul, 2000).

It is believed that real-world data lie on a low-dimensional manifold (Tenenbaum et al., 2000) embedded in a high-dimensional space and the data points are well separated in high-dimensional data space. For example, realistic images are scattered in pixel space and the distance between every two images can be very large if measured in pixel difference even if they are similar perceptually. To model this property, we consider a dataset consisting of  $M$  datapoints  $\{\pmb{u}^{(m)}\}_{m=1}^{M}$ . The exact score is

$$
\nabla \log p _ {t} (\boldsymbol {u}) = \sum_ {m} w _ {m} \nabla \log p _ {0 t} (\boldsymbol {u} | \boldsymbol {u} ^ {(m)}), \quad w _ {m} = \frac {p _ {0 t} (\boldsymbol {u} | \boldsymbol {u} ^ {(m)})}{\sum_ {m} p _ {0 t} (\boldsymbol {u} | \boldsymbol {u} ^ {(m)})}, \tag {15}
$$

which can be interpreted as a weighted sum of  $M$  score functions associated with Dirac distributions. This is illustrated in Fig. 2. In the red color region where the weights  $\{w_{m}\}$  are dominated by one

specific data  $\pmb{u}^{(m^*)}$  and thus  $\nabla \log p_t(\pmb{u}) \approx \nabla \log p_{0t}(\pmb{u}|\pmb{u}^{(m^*)})$ . Moreover, in the green region different modes have similar  $\nabla \log p_{0t}(\pmb{u}|\pmb{u}^{(m)})$  as all of them are close to Gaussian and can be approximated by any condition score of any mode. The  $\{\epsilon_{\mathrm{GT}}(\pmb{u}(t), t)\}$  trajectories in Fig. 2 validate our hypothesis as we have very smooth curves at the beginning and ending period. The phenomenon caused by the manifold hypothesis partially justifies the Dirac distribution assumption in Prop 1 and Prop 3 and explains the effectiveness of DDIMs.

# 4 GENERALIZE AND IMPROVE DDIM

The DDIM is specifically designed for DDPMs. Can we generalize it to other DMs? With the insights in Prop 1 and 3, it turns out that with a carefully chosen  $K_{\tau}$ , we can generalize DDIMs to any DMs with general drift and diffusion. We coin the resulted algorithm the Generalized DDIM (gDDIM). Concretely, we apply the gDDIM to CLD to illustrate our approach.

# 4.1 DETERMINISTIC GDDIM WITH PROP 1

Toy dataset: Motivated by Prop 1, we ask whether there exists an  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GT}}$  that remains constant along a solution to the probability flow ODE Eq. (7). We start with a special case with data distribution  $p_0(\boldsymbol{u}) = \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{u}_0, \Sigma_0)$ . It turns out that any solution to Eq. (7) is of the form

$$
\boldsymbol {u} (t) = \Psi (t, 0) \boldsymbol {u} _ {0} + \boldsymbol {R} _ {t} \epsilon \tag {16}
$$

with a constant  $\epsilon$  and a time-varying  $\pmb{R}_t\in \mathbb{R}^{D\times D}$  that satisfies  $\pmb {R}_0\pmb {R}_0^T = \Sigma_0$  and

$$
\frac {d \boldsymbol {R} _ {t}}{d t} = \left(\boldsymbol {F} _ {t} + \frac {1}{2} \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} \boldsymbol {G} _ {t} ^ {T} \Sigma_ {t} ^ {- 1}\right) \boldsymbol {R} _ {t}. \tag {17}
$$

Here  $\Psi(t, s)$  is the transition matrix associated with  $F_{\tau}$ ; it is the solution to  $\frac{\partial \Psi(t, s)}{\partial t} = F_t \Psi(t, s), \Psi(s, s) = I_D$ . Interestingly,  $\mathbf{R}_t$  satisfies  $\mathbf{R}_t \mathbf{R}_t^T = \Sigma_t$  like  $\mathbf{K}_t$  in Eq. (4). We remark  $\mathbf{K}_t = \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \mathbf{I}_d$  is a solution to Eq. (17) when the DM is specialized to DDPM. Based on Eq. (16) and Eq. (17), we extend Prop 1 to more general DMs.

Proposition 4. Assume the data distribution  $p_0(\pmb{u})$  is  $\mathcal{N}(\pmb{u}_0, \Sigma_0)$ . Let  $\pmb{u}(t)$  be an arbitrary solution to the probability flow ODE Eq. (7) with the ground truth score, then  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{GT}}(\pmb{u}(t), t) := -\pmb{R}_t^T \nabla \log p_t(\pmb{u}(t))$  remains constant along  $\pmb{u}(t)$ .

A direct consequence of Prop 4 is that we can conduct accurate sampling in one step in the toy example since we can recover the score along any simulated trajectory given its value at  $t = T$ , if  $\pmb{K}_t$  in Eq. (4) is set to be  $\pmb{R}_t$ . This choice  $\pmb{K}_t = \pmb{R}_t$  will make a huge difference in sampling quality as we will show later. The fact provides guidance to design an efficient sampling scheme for realistic data.

Realistic dataset: As the accurate score is not available for realistic datasets, we need to use learned score  $s_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u},t)$  for sampling. With our new parameterization  $\epsilon_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u},t) = -\boldsymbol{R}_t^T\boldsymbol{s}_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u},t)$  and the approximation  $\tilde{\epsilon}_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u},\tau) = \epsilon_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u}(t),t)$  for  $\tau \in [t - \Delta t,t]$ , we reach the update step for deterministic gDDIM by solving probability flow with approximator  $\tilde{\epsilon}_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{u},\tau)$  exactly as

$$
\boldsymbol {u} (t - \Delta t) = \Psi (t - \Delta t, t) \boldsymbol {u} (t) + \left[ \int_ {t} ^ {t - \Delta t} \frac {1}{2} \Psi (t - \Delta t, \tau) \boldsymbol {G} _ {\tau} \boldsymbol {G} _ {\tau} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {R} _ {\tau} ^ {- T} d \tau \right] \epsilon_ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u} (t), t). \tag {18}
$$

Multistep predictor-corrector for ODE: Inspired by Zhang & Chen (2022), we further boost the sampling efficiency of gDDIM by combining Eq. (18) with multistep methods (Hochbruck & Ostermann, 2010; Zhang & Chen, 2022; Liu et al., 2022). We derive multistep predictor-corrector methods to reduce the number of steps while retaining accuracy (Press et al., 2007; Sauer, 2005). Empirically, we found that using more NFEs in predictor leads to better performance when the total NFE is small. Thus, we only present multistep predictor for deterministic gDDIM. We include the proof and multistep corrector in App. B. For time discretization grid  $\{t_i\}_{i=0}^N$  where  $t_0 = 0$ ,  $t_N = T$ ,

the  $q$ -th step predictor from  $t_i$  to  $t_{i-1}$  in term of  $\epsilon_\theta$  parameterization reads

$$
\boldsymbol {u} \left(t _ {i - 1}\right) = \Psi \left(t _ {i - 1}, t _ {i}\right) \boldsymbol {u} \left(t _ {i}\right) + \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {q - 1} \left[ C _ {i j} \epsilon_ {\theta} \left(\boldsymbol {u} \left(t _ {i + j}\right), t _ {i + j}\right) \right], \tag {19a}
$$

$$
\mathbf {C} _ {i j} = \int_ {t _ {i}} ^ {t _ {i - 1}} \frac {1}{2} \Psi (t _ {i - 1}, \tau) \boldsymbol {G} _ {\tau} \boldsymbol {G} _ {\tau} ^ {T} \boldsymbol {R} _ {\tau} ^ {- T} \prod_ {k \neq j} \left[ \frac {\tau - t _ {i + k}}{t _ {i + j} - t _ {i + k}} \right] d \tau . \tag {19b}
$$

# 4.2 STOCHASTIC GDDIM WITH PROP 3

Following the same spirits, we generalize Prop 3

Proposition 5. Assume the data distribution  $p_0(\boldsymbol{u})$  is  $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{u}_0, \Sigma_0)$ . Given any evaluation of the score function  $\nabla \log p_s(\boldsymbol{u}(s))$ , one can recover  $\nabla \log p_t(\boldsymbol{u})$  for any  $t$ ,  $\boldsymbol{u}$  as

$$
\nabla \log p _ {t} (\boldsymbol {u}) = \Sigma_ {t} ^ {- 1} \Psi (t, s) \Sigma_ {s} \nabla \log p _ {s} (\boldsymbol {u} (s)) - \Sigma_ {t} ^ {- 1} [ \boldsymbol {u} - \Psi (t, s) \boldsymbol {u} (s) ]. \tag {20}
$$

Prop 5 is not surprising; in our example, the score has a closed form. Eq. (20) not only provides an accurate score estimation for our toy dataset, but also serves as a score approximator for realistic data.

Realistic dataset: Based on Eq. (20), with the parameterization  $s_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau) = -\pmb{R}_{\tau}^{-T}\epsilon_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau)$ , we propose the following gDDIM approximator  $\tilde{\epsilon}_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau)$  for  $\epsilon_{\theta}(\pmb{u}, \tau)$

$$
\tilde {\epsilon} _ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u}, \tau) = \boldsymbol {R} _ {\tau} ^ {- 1} \Psi (\tau , s) \boldsymbol {R} _ {s} \epsilon_ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u} (s), s) + \boldsymbol {R} _ {\tau} ^ {- 1} [ \boldsymbol {u} - \Psi (\tau , s) \boldsymbol {u} (s) ]. \tag {21}
$$

Proposition 6. With the parameterization  $\epsilon_{\theta}(\pmb{u},t) = -\pmb{R}_t^T\pmb{s}_{\theta}(\pmb{u},t)$  and the approximator  $\tilde{\epsilon}_{\theta}(\pmb{u},\tau)$  in Eq. (21), the solution to Eq. (6) satisfies

$$
\boldsymbol {u} (t) \sim \mathcal {N} (\Psi (t, s) \boldsymbol {u} (s) + [ \hat {\Psi} (t, s) - \Psi (t, s) ] \boldsymbol {R} _ {s} \epsilon_ {\theta} (\boldsymbol {u} (s), s), \boldsymbol {P} _ {s t}), \tag {22}
$$

where  $\hat{\Psi}(t,s)$  is the transition matrix associated with  $\hat{F}_{\tau} := F_{\tau} + \frac{1 + \lambda^2}{2} G_{\tau} G_{\tau}^T \Sigma_{\tau}^{-1}$  and the covariance matrix  $P_{st}$  solves

$$
\frac {d \boldsymbol {P} _ {s \tau}}{d \tau} = \hat {\boldsymbol {F}} _ {\tau} \boldsymbol {P} _ {s \tau} + \boldsymbol {P} _ {s \tau} \hat {\boldsymbol {F}} _ {\tau} ^ {T} + \lambda^ {2} \boldsymbol {G} _ {\tau} \boldsymbol {G} _ {\tau} ^ {T}, \quad \boldsymbol {P} _ {s s} = 0. \tag {23}
$$

Our stochastic gDDIM then uses Eq. (22) for update. Though the stochastic gDDIM and the deterministic gDDIM look quite different from each other, there exists a connection between them.

Proposition 7. Eq. (22) in stochastic gDDIM reduces to Eq. (18) in deterministic gDDIM when  $\lambda = 0$ .

# 5 EXPERIMENTS

As gDDIM reduces to DDIM for VPSDE and DDIM proves very successful, we validate the generation and effectiveness of gDDIM on CLD and BDM. We design experiments to answer the following questions. How to verify Prop 4 and 5 empirically? Can gDDIM improve sampling efficiency compared with existing works? What differences do the choice of  $\lambda$  and  $K_{t}$  make? We conduct experiments with different DMs and sampling algorithms on CIFAR10 for quantitative comparison. We include more illustrative experiments on toy datasets, high dimensional image datasets, and more baseline comparison in App. C.

Choice of  $K_{t}$ :  $L_{t}$  vs  $R_{t}$ . A key of gDDIM is the special choice  $K_{t} = R_{t}$  which is obtained via solving Eq. (17). In CLD,  $L_{t}$  (Dockhorn et al., 2021) does not obey Eq. (17) and  $L_{t} \neq R_{t}$ . As it is shown in Fig. 1, on real datasets with a trained score model, we randomly pick pixel locations and check the pixel value and  $\epsilon_{\theta}$  output along the solutions to the probability flow ODE produced by the high-resolution ODE solver. With the choice  $K_{t} = L_{t}$ ,  $\epsilon_{\theta}^{(L)}(\boldsymbol{u}, t; \boldsymbol{v})$  suffers from oscillation like  $x$  value along time. However,  $\epsilon_{\theta}^{(R)}(\boldsymbol{u}, t)$  is much more flat. We further compare samples generated by  $L_{t}$  and  $R_{t}$  parameterization in Tab. 1, where both use the multistep exponential solver developed in Zhang & Chen (2022).

Choice of  $\lambda$ : ODE vs SDE. We further conduct a study with different  $\lambda$  values. Note that polynomial extrapolation in Eq. (19) is not used here even when  $\lambda = 0$ . As it is shown in Tab. 2, increasing  $\lambda$  deteriorates the sample quality, demonstrating our claim that deterministic DDIM has better performance than its stochastic counterpart when a small NFE is used. We also find stochastic gDDIM significantly outperforms EM, which indicates the effectiveness of the approximation Eq. (21).

Accelerate various DMs We present a comparison among various DMs and various sampling algorithms. To make a fair comparison, we compare three DMs with similar size networks while retaining other hyperparameters from their original works. We make two modifications to DDPM, including continuous-time training (Song et al., 2020b) and smaller stop sampling time (Karras et al., 2022), which help improve sampling quality empirically. For BDM, we note Hoogeboom & Salimans (2022) only supports the ancestral sampling algorithm, a variant of EM algorithm. With reformulated noisy and denoising process as SDE Eq. (11), we can generate samples by solving corresponding SDE/ODEs. The sampling quality of gDDIM with 50 NFE can outperform the original ancestral sampler with 1000 NFE, more than 20 times acceleration.

Table 3: Acceleration on various DMs with similar training pipelines and architecture. For RK45, we tune its tolerance hyperparameters so that the real NFE is close but not equal to the given NFE.  $\dagger$ : pre-trained model from Song et al. (2020b).  $\dagger\ddagger$ : Karras et al. (2022) apply Heun method in rescaled DM, which is essentially exponential integrator with Heun solver (Hochbruck & Ostermann, 2010; Zhang & Chen, 2022).

# 6 CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Contribution: The more structural knowledge we leverage, the more efficient algorithms we obtain. In this work, we provide a clean interpretation of DDIMs based on the manifold hypothesis and the sparsity property on realistic datasets. This new perspective unboxes the numerical discretization used in DDIM and explains the advantage of ODE-based sampler over SDE-based when NFE is small. Based on this interpretation, we extend DDIMs to general diffusion models. The new algorithm, gDDIM, only requires a tiny but elegant modification to the parameterization of the score model and improves sampling efficiency drastically. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our new sampling algorithm.

**Limitation:** There are several promising future directions. First, though gDDIM is designed for general DMs, we only verify it on three DMs. It is beneficial to explore more efficient diffusion processes for different datasets, in which we believe gDDIM will play an important role in designing sampling algorithms. Second, more investigations are needed to design an efficient sampling algorithm by exploiting more structural knowledge in DMs. The structural knowledge can originate from different sources such as different modalities of datasets, and mathematical structures presented in specific diffusion processes.
