# ABSTRACT

For distributions  $p$  and  $q$  with different supports, the divergence  $\mathrm{D}(p||q)$  may not exist. We define a spread divergence  $\tilde{\mathrm{D}}(p||q)$  on modified  $p$  and  $q$  and describe sufficient conditions for the existence of such a divergence. We demonstrate how to maximize the discriminatory power of a given divergence by parameterizing and learning the spread. We also give examples of using a spread divergence to train and improve implicit generative models, including linear models (Independent Components Analysis) and non-linear models (Deep Generative Networks).

# 1 INTRODUCTION

A divergence  $\mathrm{D}(p||q)$  (see, for example Dragomir (2005)) is a measure of the difference between two distributions  $p$  and  $q$  with the property

$$
\mathrm {D} (p | | q) \geq 0 \text {a n d} \mathrm {D} (p | | q) = 0 \Leftrightarrow p = q \tag {1}
$$

We are interested in situations in which the supports of the two distributions are different,  $\operatorname{supp}(p) \neq \operatorname{supp}(q)$ . An important class is the  $f$ -divergence, defined as

$$
\mathrm {D} _ {f} (p | | q) = \mathbb {E} _ {q (x)} \left[ f \left(\frac {p (x)}{q (x)}\right) \right] \tag {2}
$$

where  $f(x)$  is a convex function with  $f(1) = 0$ . A special case of an  $f$ -divergence is the well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence  $\mathrm{KL}(p||q) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x)}\left[\log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right]$ . By setting  $p(x)$  to the empirical data distribution, maximum likelihood training of a model  $q(x)$  corresponds to minimising  $\mathrm{KL}(p||q)$ . However, this divergence may not be defined since the ratio  $p(x) / q(x)$  can cause a division by zero.

This is a challenge since popular implicit generative models (Mohamed & Lakshminarayanan (2016)) of the form  $q(x) = \int \delta(x - g_{\theta}(z)) p(z) dz$  only have limited support. In this case, maximum likelihood to learn the model parameters  $\theta$  is not available and alternative approaches to measure the difference between distributions such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (Gretton et al. (2012)) or Wasserstein distance (Peyre et al. (2019)) are required.

# 2 SPREAD DIVERGENCE

From  $q(x)$  and  $p(x)$  we define new distributions  $\tilde{q}(y)$  and  $\tilde{p}(y)$  that have the same support<sup>1</sup>. Using the notation  $\int_{x}$  to denote integration  $\int (\cdot) dx$  for continuous  $x$ , and  $\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}}$  for discrete  $x$  with domain  $\mathcal{X}$ , we define a random variable  $y$  with the same domain as  $x$  and distributions

$$
\tilde {p} (y) = \int_ {x} p (y | x) p (x), \quad \tilde {q} (y) = \int_ {x} p (y | x) q (x) \tag {3}
$$

where  $p(y|x)$  is 'noise' designed to 'spread' the mass of  $p$  and  $q$  such that  $\tilde{p}(y)$  and  $\tilde{q}(y)$  have the same support. For example, if we use a Gaussian  $p(y|x) = \mathcal{N}\left(y|x,\sigma^2\right)$ , then  $\tilde{p}$  and  $\tilde{q}$  both have support  $\mathbb{R}$ . We also impose an additional requirement on the noise  $p(y|x)$ , namely that  $\mathrm{D}(\tilde{p}||\tilde{q}) = 0 \Leftrightarrow p = q$ . As we show in section(2.1) this is guaranteed for certain 'noise' distributions. Given these requirements, we can define the Spread Divergence  $\tilde{\mathrm{D}}(p||q) \equiv \mathrm{D}(\tilde{p}||\tilde{q})$ . This satisfies the divergence requirement  $\tilde{\mathrm{D}}(p||q) \geq 0$  and  $\tilde{\mathrm{D}}(p||q) = 0 \Leftrightarrow p = q$ .

For example, given two delta distributions  $p_0(x) = \delta (x - \mu_0), p_1(x) = \delta (x - \mu_1)$ , the KL divergence (or  $f$ -divergence) between them is not defined. However, the spread KL divergence (or  $f$ -divergence) is defined. Assume a Gaussian noise distribution  $p(y|x) = \mathcal{N}\left(y|x,\sigma^2\right)$ , the "spreaded" delta distributions have the form:  $\tilde{p}_0(y) = \int_x\delta (x - \mu_0)\mathcal{N}\left(y|x,\sigma^2\right) = \mathcal{N}\left(y|\mu_0,\sigma^2\right)$ ,  $\tilde{p}_1(y) = \int_x\delta (x - \mu_1)\mathcal{N}\left(y|x,\sigma^2\right) = \mathcal{N}\left(y|\mu_1,\sigma^2\right)$ . Therefore, the spread KL divergence (with Gaussian noise) between two delta distributions is equivalent to the KL divergence between two Gaussian distributions with the same variance, which has closed form (see appendix(D) for a derivation):

$$
\widetilde {\mathrm {K L}} \left(p _ {0} (x) \| p _ {1} (x)\right) = \mathrm {K L} \left(\tilde {p} _ {0} (y) \| \tilde {p} _ {1} (y)\right) = \| \mu_ {0} - \mu_ {1} \| _ {2} ^ {2}. \tag {4}
$$

It's worth noticing that in the case of two delta distributions, the spread KL divergence is equal to the squared 2-Wasserstein distance (see Peyre et al. (2019); Gelbrich (1990)).

# 2.1 NOISE REQUIREMENTS FOR A SPREAD DIVERGENCE

Our main interest is in using noise to define a new divergence in situations in which the original divergence  $\mathrm{D}(p||q)$  is itself not defined. For discrete variables  $x \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ ,  $y \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ , the noise  $P_{ij} = p(y = i|x = j)$  must be a distribution  $\sum_{i} P_{ij} = 1$ ,  $P_{ij} \geq 0$  and

$$
\sum_ {j} P _ {i j} p _ {j} = \sum_ {j} P _ {i j} q _ {j} \quad \forall i \quad \Rightarrow \quad p _ {j} = q _ {j} \quad \forall j \tag {5}
$$

which is equivalent to the requirement that the matrix  $P$  is invertible. There is an additional requirement that the spread divergence exists. In the case of  $f$ -divergences, the spread divergence exists provided that  $\tilde{p}$  and  $\tilde{q}$  have the same support. This is guaranteed if

$$
\sum_ {j} P _ {i j} p _ {j} > 0, \quad \sum_ {j} P _ {i j} q _ {j} > 0 \quad \forall i \tag {6}
$$

which is satisfied if  $P_{ij} > 0$ . In general, therefore, there is a space of noise distributions  $p(y|x)$  that define a valid spread divergence. For example, the 'antifreeze' method of Furmston & Barber (2009) is a special form of spread noise to define a valid KL divergence (see also Barber (2012)).

For continuous variables, in order for  $\tilde{\mathrm{D}}(p||q) = 0 \Rightarrow p = q$ , the noise  $p(y|x)$ , with  $\dim(Y) = \dim(X)$  must be a probability density and satisfy

$$
\int p (y | x) p (x) d x = \int p (y | x) q (x) d x \quad \forall y \in Y \quad \Rightarrow p (x) = q (x) \quad \forall x \in X \tag {7}
$$

In the following section we discuss the special case of stationary noise for continuous systems.

# 3 STATIONARY SPREAD DIVERGENCES

Consider stationary noise  $p(y|x) = K(y - x)$  where  $K(x)$  is a probability density function with  $K(x) > 0$ ,  $x \in \mathbb{R}$ . In this case  $\tilde{p}$  and  $\tilde{q}$  are defined as a convolution

$$
\tilde {p} (y) = \int K (y - x) p (x) d x = (K * p) (y), \quad \tilde {q} (y) = \int K (y - x) q (x) d x = (K * q) (y) \tag {8}
$$

Since  $K > 0$ ,  $\tilde{p}$  and  $\tilde{q}$  are guaranteed to have the same support  $\mathbb{R}$ . A sufficient condition for the existence of the Fourier Transform  $\mathcal{F}\{f\}$  of a function  $f(x)$  for real  $x$  is that  $f$  is absolutely integrable. Since all distributions  $p(x)$  are absolutely integrable, both  $\mathcal{F}\{p\}$  and  $\mathcal{F}\{q\}$  are guaranteed to exist. Assuming  $\mathcal{F}\{K\}$  exists, we can then use the convolution theorem to write

$$
\mathcal {F} \left\{\tilde {p} \right\} = \mathcal {F} \left\{K \right\} \mathcal {F} \left\{p \right\}, \quad \mathcal {F} \left\{\tilde {q} \right\} = \mathcal {F} \left\{K \right\} \mathcal {F} \left\{q \right\} \tag {9}
$$

Let  $\mathcal{F}\{K\} \neq 0$  or  $\mathcal{F}\{K\} = 0$  on at most a countable set. Then

$$
\mathcal {F} \{K \} \mathcal {F} \{p \} = \mathcal {F} \{K \} \mathcal {F} \{q \} \Rightarrow \mathcal {F} \{p \} = \mathcal {F} \{q \}. \tag {10}
$$

The proof is given in appendix(A). Using this we can write

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {D} (\tilde {p} | | \tilde {q}) = 0 \Leftrightarrow \tilde {p} = \tilde {q} (11) \\ \Leftrightarrow \mathcal {F} \{K \} \mathcal {F} \{p \} = \mathcal {F} \{K \} \mathcal {F} \{q \} (12) \\ \Leftrightarrow \mathcal {F} \{p \} = \mathcal {F} \{q \} \Leftrightarrow p = q, (13) \\ \end{array}
$$

where we used the invertibility of the Fourier transform. Hence, for stationary noise  $p(y|x) = K(y - x)$ , we can define a valid spread divergence provided (i)  $K(x)$  is a probability density function and (ii)  $\mathcal{F}\{K\} \neq 0$  or  $\mathcal{F}\{K\} = 0$  on at most a countable set. Interestingly, the sufficient conditions for defining a valid spread divergence such that  $\mathrm{D}(\tilde{p} ||\tilde{q}) = 0 \Leftrightarrow p = q$  are analogous to the characteristic condition on kernels such that the Maximum Mean Discrepancy  $\mathrm{MMD}(p,q) = 0 \Leftrightarrow p = q$ , see Striperumbudur et al. (2011; 2012); Gretton et al. (2012). As an example of such a noise process, consider Gaussian noise,

$$
K (x) = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2 \pi \sigma^ {2}}} e ^ {- \frac {1}{2 \sigma^ {2}} x ^ {2}}, \quad \mathcal {F} \left\{K \right\} (\omega) = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2 \pi \sigma^ {2}}} \int_ {- \infty} ^ {\infty} e ^ {i \omega x} e ^ {- \frac {1}{2 \sigma^ {2}} x ^ {2}} d x = e ^ {- \frac {\sigma^ {2} \omega^ {2}}{2}} > 0 \tag {14}
$$

Similarly, for Laplace noise

$$
K (x) = \frac {1}{2 b} e ^ {- \frac {1}{b} | x |}, \quad \mathcal {F} \left\{K \right\} (\omega) = \sqrt {\frac {2}{\pi}} \frac {b ^ {- 1}}{b ^ {- 2} + \omega^ {2}} > 0 \tag {15}
$$

Since in both cases  $K > 0$  and  $\mathcal{F}\{K\} > 0$ , Gaussian and Laplace noise can be used to define a valid spread divergence.

# 4 MAXIMISING DISCRIMINATORY POWER

From the data processing inequality (see appendix(B)), adding spread noise will always decrease the  $f$ -divergence  $\mathrm{D}_f(\tilde{p}(y) || \tilde{q}(y)) \leq \mathrm{D}_f(p(x) || q(x))$ . Intuitively, spreading out distributions makes them more similar. If we are to use a spread divergence to train a model using maximum likelihood (see section section(5)), there is the danger that adding too much noise may make the spreaded empirical distribution and spreaded model distribution so similar that it becomes difficult to numerically distinguish them, impeding training. It is useful therefore to define spread noise that maximally discerns the difference between the two distributions  $\max_{\psi} \mathrm{D}(\tilde{p}(y) || \tilde{q}(x))$  for spread noise  $p_{\psi}(y|x)$  parameterised by  $\psi$ . In general we need to constrain the spread noise to ensure that the divergence remains bounded.

We discuss below two complementary approaches to adjust  $p(y|x)$  during training. The first approach adjusts the dimension-wise correlations (this corresponds to adjusting the covariance structure for Gaussian  $p(y|x)$ ) and the second forms a mean transformation. In principle, both approaches can be combined and easily generalized to other noise distributions, such as Laplace noise.

# 4.1 LEARNING COVARIANCE STRUCTURE

Learning the covariance adjusts the shape of noise centered around the original model manifold. When we maximize the divergence between two spreaded distributions  $\max_{\psi} \mathrm{D}(\tilde{p}(y) || \tilde{q}(x))$ , the learned noise will discourage overlap between the two distributions. Hence, if the data  $p$  and model  $q$  lie on the same manifold, the noise will be orthogonal to the manifold.

In learning the Gaussian spread distribution  $p(y|x) = \mathcal{N}(y|x,\Sigma)$ , the number of parameters in the covariance matrix  $\Sigma$  scales quadratically with the data dimension  $D$ . We thus define  $\Sigma = \sigma^2 I + LL^\top$  where  $\sigma^2 > 0$  is fixed (to ensure bounded spread divergence) and  $L$  is a learnable  $D \times R$  matrix with  $R \ll D$ . Calculating the log likelihood and sampling can then be performed efficiently using standard Woodberry identities, see appendix(J).

# 4.2 LEARNING THE MEAN TRANSFORM

Consider  $p(y|x) = K(y - f(x))$  for injective  $f$  and stationary  $K$ . Then, we define

$$
\tilde {p} (y) = \int K (y - f (x)) p _ {x} (x) d x \tag {16}
$$

Note that this is a valid spread divergence since, using change of variables,

$$
\tilde {p} (y) = \int K (y - z) p _ {z} (z) d z, \quad p _ {z} (z) = p _ {x} \left(f ^ {- 1} (z)\right) / J \left(x = f ^ {- 1} (z)\right) \tag {17}
$$

where  $J$  is the absolute Jacobian of  $f$ . Hence,  $\mathrm{D}(\tilde{p}_y||\tilde{q}_y) = 0\Leftrightarrow p_z = q_z\Leftrightarrow p_x = q_x$ . Each injective  $f_{\phi}$  gives a different noise  $p(y|x)$ , we can thus search for the best noise implicitly by learning  $f_{\phi}$ .

In our experiments we use the invertible residual network Behrmann et al. (2018)  $f_{\psi}:\mathbb{R}^{D}\to \mathbb{R}^{D}$  with  $f_{\psi} = (f_{\psi}^{1}\circ \ldots \circ f_{\psi}^{T})$  denotes a ResNet with blocks  $f_{\psi}^{t} = I(\cdot) + g_{\psi_{t}}(\cdot)$ . Then  $f_{\psi}$  is invertible if the Lipschitz-constants  $Lip(g_{\psi_t}) < 1$  for all  $t\in \{1,\dots ,T\}$ . Note that when using the spread divergence for training (see section(5.2.2)) we only need samples from  $\tilde{p} (y)$  which can be obtained from equation 16 by first sampling  $x$  from  $p_x(x)$  and then  $y$  from  $p(y|x) = K(y - f(x))$ ; this does not require computing the Jacobian or inverse  $f_{\psi}^{-1}$ .

# 5 SPREAD MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION

Minimising the forward KL divergence between the empirical data distribution  $\hat{p} (x)$  and a model  $p_{\theta}(x)$  is equivalent to Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of the parameters  $\theta$  of the model. Minimising instead the forward spread KL divergence,  $\widetilde{\mathrm{KL}} (\hat{p} (x)||p_{\theta}(x)) = -\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\log p_{\theta}(y_n) + const.$ , where  $y_{n}$  are sampled i.i.d from  $\tilde{p} (y) = \int_{x}p(y|x)\hat{p} (x)$ , results in a new type of estimation, namely spread MLE. In what follows, we will discuss the statistical properties of spread MLE and demonstrate how it enables the training of models where maximum likelihood is not suited.

# 5.1 STATISTICAL PROPERTIES

Maximum likelihood is a cherished criterion because it exhibits many favourable statistical properties, mainly consistency (convergence to the true parameters in the large data limit) and asymptotic efficiency (achieves the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound, which is a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimators) - see Casella & Berger (2002) for an introduction. A key desideratum for spread MLE is to analyse how these properties are affected. In appendix(E) we demonstrate that spread MLE (for a certain family of spread noise) needs weaker sufficient conditions than MLE for both consistency and asymptotic efficiency. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for the existence of MLE is that the likelihood function is continuous over a compact parameter space  $\Theta$ . We provide an example in appendix(E.1) where this compactness requirement is violated, but spread MLE is still well defined.

# 5.2 APPLICATIONS

As an application to show the effectiveness of spread MLE, we use it to train implicit models

$$
p _ {\theta} (x) = \int \delta \left(x - g _ {\theta} (z)\right) p (z) d z \tag {18}
$$

where  $\theta$  are the parameters of the encoder  $g$ . We show that, despite the likelihood not being defined (see also section(K) for a simple linear model example), we can nevertheless successfully train such models using modified EM/variational algorithms (Barber (2012)).

# 5.2.1 TRAINING IMPLICIT LINEAR MODELS: DETERMINISTIC ICA

ICA (Independent Components Analysis) corresponds to the model  $p(x,z) = p(x|z)\prod_{i}p(z_{i})$ , where the independent components  $z_{i}$  follow a non-Gaussian distribution. For Gaussian noise ICA an observation  $x$  is assumed to be generated by the process  $p(x|z) = \prod_j\mathcal{N}\left(x_j|g_j(z),\gamma^2\right)$  where  $g_{i}(z)$  mixes the independent latent process  $z$ . In linear ICA,  $g_{j}(z) = a_{j}^{\top}z$  where  $a_{j}$  is the  $j^{th}$  column on the mixing matrix  $A$ . For small observation noise  $\gamma^2$ , it is well known that the maximum likelihood EM algorithm to learn  $A$  from observed data is ineffective (Bermond & Cardoso, 1999; Winther & Petersen, 2007). To see this, consider  $X = Z$  (where  $X$  and  $Z$  are the dimension of the data and latents respectively) and invertible  $A$ ,  $x = Az$ . At iteration  $k$  the EM algorithm has an estimate  $A_{k}$  of the mixing matrix. The M-step updates  $A_{k}$  to

$$
A _ {k + 1} = \mathbb {E} \left[ x z ^ {\mathsf {T}} \right] \mathbb {E} \left[ z z ^ {\mathsf {T}} \right] ^ {- 1} \tag {19}
$$

(b) Error versus number of training points.  
Figure 1: Relative error  $\left| A_{ij}^{est} - A_{ij}^{true} \right| / \left| A_{ij}^{true} \right|$  versus observation noise (a) and number of training points (b). (a) For  $X = 20$  observations and  $Z = 10$  latent variables, we generate  $N = 20000$  datapoints from the model  $x = Az$ , for independent zero mean unit variance Laplace components on  $z$ . The elements of  $A$  used to generate the data are uniform random  $\pm 1$ . We use  $S_y = 1$ ,  $S_z = 1000$  samples and 2000 EM iterations to estimate  $A$ . The error is averaged over all  $i, j$  and 10 experiments. We also plot standard errors around the mean relative error. In blue we show the error in learning the underlying parameter using the standard EM algorithm. As expected, as  $\gamma \to 0$ , the error blows up as the EM algorithm ' freezes'. In orange we plot the error for EM using spread noise; no slowing down appears as the observation noise  $\gamma$  decreases. In (b), apart from very small  $N$ , the error for the spread EM algorithm is lower than for the standard EM algorithm. Here  $Z = 5$ ,  $X = 10$ ,  $S_y = 1$ ,  $S_z = 1000$ ,  $\gamma = 0.2$ , with 500 EM updates used. Results are averaged over 50 runs of randomly drawn  $A$ .

where, for zero observation noise  $(\gamma = 0)$

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ x z ^ {\mathsf {T}} \right] = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n} x _ {n} \left(A _ {k} ^ {- 1} x _ {n} ^ {\mathsf {T}}\right) = \hat {S} A _ {k} ^ {- \mathsf {T}}, \quad \mathbb {E} \left[ z z ^ {\mathsf {T}} \right] = A _ {k} ^ {- 1} \hat {S} A _ {k} ^ {- \mathsf {T}} \tag {20}
$$

and  $\hat{S} \equiv \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n}x_{n}x_{n}^{\mathsf{T}}$  is the moment matrix of the data. Thus,  $A_{k + 1} = \hat{S} A_k^{-\mathsf{T}}\left(A_k^{-1}\hat{S} A_k^{-\mathsf{T}}\right)^{-1} = A_k$  and the algorithm 'freezes'. Similarly, for low noise  $\gamma \ll 1$  progress critically slows down.

To deal with small noise and the limiting case of a deterministic model  $(\gamma = 0)$ , we consider Gaussian spread noise  $p(y|x) = \mathcal{N}\left(y|x,\sigma^2 I_X\right)$  to give

$$
p (y, z) = \int p (y | x) p (x, z) d x = \prod_ {j} \mathcal {N} \left(y _ {j} \mid g _ {j} (z), \left(\gamma^ {2} + \sigma^ {2}\right) I _ {X}\right) \prod_ {i} p \left(z _ {i}\right). \tag {21}
$$

Using spread noise, the empirical distribution is replaced by the spreaded empirical distribution  $\hat{p}(y) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n}\mathcal{N}\left(y|x^{n},\sigma^{2}I_{X}\right)$ . The M-step has the same form as equation 19 but with modified statistics

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ y z ^ {\mathsf {T}} \right] = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n} \int \mathcal {N} \left(y | x ^ {n}, \sigma^ {2}\right) p (z | y) y z ^ {\mathsf {T}} d z d y,
$$

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ z z ^ {\mathsf {T}} \right] = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n} \int \mathcal {N} (y | x ^ {n}, \sigma^ {2}) p (z | y) z z ^ {\mathsf {T}} d z d y. \tag {22}
$$

The E-step optimally sets

$$
p (z | y) = \frac {1}{Z _ {q} (y)} \mathcal {N} (z | \mu (y), \Sigma) \prod_ {i} p \left(z _ {i}\right), \quad Z _ {q} (y) = \int \mathcal {N} (z | \mu (y), \Sigma) \prod_ {i} p \left(z _ {i}\right) d z \tag {23}
$$

where  $Z_{q}(y)$  is a normaliser and

$$
\Sigma = \left(\gamma^ {2} + \sigma^ {2}\right) \left(A ^ {\mathsf {T}} A\right) ^ {- 1}, \quad \mu (y) = \left(A ^ {\mathsf {T}} A\right) ^ {- 1} A y. \tag {24}
$$

Since the posterior  $p(z|y)$  peaks around  $\mathcal{N}(z|\mu(y), \Sigma)$ , we rewrite equation 22 as

$$
\mathbb {E} \left[ y z ^ {\mathsf {T}} \right] = \frac {1}{N} \sum_ {n} \int \mathcal {N} \left(y | x ^ {n}, \sigma^ {2}\right) \mathcal {N} \left(z | \mu (y), \Sigma\right) \frac {\prod_ {i} p (z _ {i})}{Z _ {q} (y)} y z ^ {\mathsf {T}} d z d y
$$

Figure 2: Samples from a generative model (deterministic output) trained using  $\delta$ -VAE with (a) fixed Laplace covariance, (b) fixed Gaussian covariance and (c) learned Gaussian covariance. We first train with one epoch a standard VAE as initialization to all models, and keep latent code  $z \sim \mathcal{N}(z|0, I_Z)$  fixed when sampling from these models, so we can more easily compare the sample quality. Figure (d) visualizes the absolute mean of the leading 20 eigenvectors of the learned covariance.

and similarly for  $\mathbb{E}\left[zz^{\mathsf{T}}\right]$ . Writing the expectations with respect to  $\mathcal{N}(z|\mu(y),\Sigma)$  allows for a simple but effective importance sampling approximation focused on regions of high probability. We implement this update by drawing  $S_{y}$  samples from  $\mathcal{N}\left(y|x_{n},\sigma^{2}I_{X}\right)$  and, for each  $y$  sample, we draw  $S_{z}$  samples from  $\mathcal{N}(z|\mu(y),\Sigma)$ . This scheme has the advantage over more standard variational approaches, see for example Winther & Petersen (2007), in that we obtain a consistent estimator of the M-step update for  $A$ . We show results for a toy experiment in figure(1), learning the underlying mixing matrix in a deterministic non-square setting. Note that standard algorithms such as FastICA (Hyvärinen, 1999) fail in this setting. The spread noise is set to  $\sigma = \max(0.001, 2.5 * \mathrm{sqrt(mean}(AA^{\mathsf{T}})))$ . This modified EM algorithm thus learns a good approximation of the underlying  $A$ , with no critical slowing down.

# 5.2.2 TRAINING IMPLICIT NON-LINEAR MODELS:  $\delta$ -VAE

A standard way to train a deep generative model  $p_{\theta}(x) = \int p_{\theta}(x|z)p(z)dz$  is to use maximum likelihood (minimizing  $\mathrm{D}(\hat{p}(x)||p_{\theta}(x))$ ). The likelihood equation 18 is in general intractable and it is common to use the variational lower bound (see (Kingma & Welling, 2013)). However, for a deterministic observation model  $p_{\theta}(x|z) = \delta(x - g_{\theta}(z))$  and  $Z < X$ , this generative model describes only a low dimensional manifold in the data space and the divergence  $\mathrm{D}(\hat{p}(x)||p_{\theta}(x))$  is not well defined. Additionally, the above bound is not well defined (due to log of a delta function) and the variational EM approach fails, as in the deterministic ICA setting. To address this, we instead minimize the spread divergence  $\mathrm{KL}(\tilde{p}(y)||\tilde{p}_{\theta}(y))$ . For Gaussian noise with fixed diagonal noise  $p(y|x) = \mathcal{N}(y|x,\sigma^2 I_X)$ , we can write  $\tilde{p}(y) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\mathcal{N}(y|x_n,\sigma^2 I_X)$  and

$$
\tilde {p} _ {\theta} (y) = \int p (y | x) p _ {\theta} (x) d x = \int \mathcal {N} \left(y \mid g _ {\theta} (z), \sigma^ {2} I _ {X}\right) p (z) d z = \int p _ {\theta} (y | z) p (z) d z. \tag {25}
$$

We then minimize the divergence

$$
\operatorname {K L} \left(\tilde {p} (y) | | \tilde {p} _ {\theta} (y)\right) = - \int \tilde {p} (y) \log \tilde {p} _ {\theta} (y) d y + c o n s t. \tag {26}
$$

Typically, the integral over  $y$  is intractable, in which case we resort to a sampling estimation. Neglecting constants, the divergence estimator is  $\frac{1}{NS}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{s=1}^{S}\log \tilde{p}_{\theta}(y_s^n)$ , where  $y_s^n$  is a spread noise sample from  $p(y_n|x_n)$ ; for example  $y_s^n \sim \mathcal{N}(y_s^n|x_n,\sigma^2 I_X)$ . For non-linear  $g$ , the distribution  $\tilde{p}_{\theta}(y)$  is usually intractable and we therefore use the variational lower bound

$$
\log \tilde {p} _ {\theta} (y) \geq \int q _ {\phi} (z | y) (- \log q _ {\phi} (z | y) + \log (p _ {\theta} (y | z) p (z))) d z. \tag {27}
$$

The approach is a straightforward extension of the standard variational autoencoder and in appendix(G) we also derive a lower variance objective and detail how to learn the spread noise (also see appendix(F)). We dub this model and associated spread divergence training the  $\delta$ -VAE'.

Table 1: CelebA FID Scores. The  $\delta$ -VAE results are the average over 5 independent measurements. The scores of GAN-based models are based on a large-scale hyperparameter search and take the best FID obtained Lucic et al. (2018). The results of VAE and WAE-based model are from Tolstikhin et al. (2017).

MNIST Experiment: We trained a  $\delta$ -VAE on MNIST (LeCun et al. (2010)) with (i) fixed Laplace spread noise, equation 15, (ii) fixed Gaussian spread noise, equation 14 and (iii) Gaussian noise with learned covariance, section(4.1) with rank  $R = 20$ ; see appendix(H) for details. Figures 2(a,b,c) show samples from  $p_{\theta}(x)$  for these models; MNIST is sufficiently easy that it is hard to distinguish between the quality of the fixed and learned noise samples. However, qualitatively, the sharpness of the Laplace spread noise trained model is higher than for the Gaussian noise and motivates that the spread noise can affect the quality of the learned model. We speculate that Laplace noise improves image sharpness since the noise focuses attention on discriminating between points close to the data manifold (since the Laplace distribution is leptokurtic and has a higher probability of generating points close to the data manifold than the Gaussian distribution). Figure 2(d) visualizes the Gaussian learned covariance and shows that the learned noise is largely orthogonal to the data manifold.

CelebA Experiment: We trained a  $\delta$ -VAE on the CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015) with (i) fixed and (ii) learned spread with injective function, see appendix(I). We compared to results from a standard VAE with fixed Gaussian noise  $p(x|z) = \mathcal{N}(x|g_{\theta}(z), 0.5I_X)$  Tolstikhin et al. (2017). For (i) the fixed spread divergence uses Gaussian noise  $\mathcal{N}(y|x, 0.25I_X)$ . For (ii) we use Gaussian noise with learned injective function ResNet  $f_{\psi}(\cdot) = I(\cdot) + g_{\psi}(\cdot)$ ; see appendix(I) for more details. Figure 3 shows samples from  $\delta$ -VAE trained using Gaussian spread divergence with both fixed and learned spread noise (with  $g_{\theta}(z)$  initialised to the fixed-noise setting). It is notable how the 'sharpness' of the image samples substantially increases when learning the spread noise. Table 1 shows FID (Heusel et al. (2017)) score comparisons between different algorithms<sup>3</sup>. The  $\delta$ -VAE significantly improves on the standard VAE result;  $\delta$ -VAE with injective function learning also improves on the fixed-noise  $\delta$ -VAE. Indeed the injective  $\delta$ -VAE results are comparable to popular GAN and WAE models (Gulrajani et al. (2017); Berthelot et al. (2017); Arjovsky et al. (2017); Kodali et al. (2017); Mao et al. (2017); Fedus et al. (2017); Tolstikhin et al. (2017)). Whilst the  $\delta$ -VAE results are not fully state-of-the-art, we believe it is the first time that implicit models have been trained using a principled maximum likelihood based approach. Our expectation is that by increasing the complexity of the generative model  $g_{\theta}$  and injective function  $f_{\psi}$ , or using different noise such as Laplace distribution, the results will become competitive with state-of-the-art GAN models.

# 6 RELATED WORK

MMD versus spread  $f$ -divergence: In spite of the conditions required for defining the spread divergence being closely related to the kernel requirement of MMD (Gretton et al., 2012), we also show that MMD and spread Total Variation distance<sup>4</sup> can be written as different norms ( $L_{2}$ ,  $L_{1}$  respectively) of a common objective (see appendix(C)).

Instance noise: The instance noise trick to stabilize GAN training Roth et al. (2017); Sønderby et al. (2016) is a special case of spread divergence using fixed Gaussian noise. Whilst other similar tricks (for example Furmston & Barber (2009)) have been proposed previously, we believe that it is important to state the general utility of the spread noise approach.

$\delta$ -VAE versus WAE: The Wasserstein auto-encoder Tolstikhin et al. (2017) is another implicit generative model that uses an encoder-decoder architecture. The difference is that  $\delta$ -VAE is based on KL divergence which is corresponding to MLE but WAE uses the Wasserstein distance.

$\delta$ -VAE versus denoising VAE: The Denoising VAE Im et al. (2017) uses a VAE with noise added to the data only. In contrast, the  $\delta$ -VAE adds noise to both the data and model. Since the denoising VAE model only adds noise to the model, it cannot recover the true data distribution.

MMD GAN with kernel learning: The idea of learning a kernel to increase discrimination is also used in MMD GAN (Li et al. (2017)). Similar to ours, the kernel in MMD GAN is constructed by  $\tilde{k} = k\circ f_{\psi}$  where  $k$  is a fixed kernel and  $f_{\psi}$  is a neural network. To ensure  $M_{k\circ f_{\psi}}(p,q) = 0\Leftrightarrow p = q$ , this requires  $f_{\psi}$  to be injective (Gretton et al. (2012)). However, in the MMD GAN framework,  $f_{\psi}(x)$  usually maps  $x$  to a lower dimension. This is crucial for MMD because the amount of data required to produce a reliable estimator grows with the data dimension (Ramdas et al. (2015)) and the computation cost of MMD scales quadratically with the amount of data. Whilst using a lower-dimensional mapping makes MMD more practical it also makes it difficult to construct an injective function  $f$ . For this reason, heuristics such as the auto-encoder regularizer (Li et al. (2017)) are considered. In contrast, for the  $\delta$ -VAE, the computational cost of estimating the divergence is linear in the number of datapoints. For this reason there is no need for  $f_{\psi}$  to be a lower-dimensional mapping; guaranteeing that  $f_{\psi}$  is injective is therefore relatively straightforward for the  $\delta$ -VAE.

Flow-based generative models: Invertible flow-based functions (Rezende & Mohamed (2015)) have been used to boost the representation power of generative models. Note our use of injective functions is quite distinct from the use of flow-based functions to boost generative model capacity. In our case, the injective function  $f$  does not change the model – it only changes the divergence. For this reason, the spread divergence doesn't require the log determinant of the Jacobian (which is required in Rezende & Mohamed (2015); Behrmann et al. (2018)) meaning that more general invertible functions can be used to boost the discriminatory power of a spread divergence.

# 7 SUMMARY

We described how to define a divergence even when two distributions do not have the same support. Previous approaches (Furmston & Barber, 2009; Sønderby et al., 2016) can be seen as special cases. We showed that defining divergences this way enables us to train deterministic generative models using standard likelihood based approaches. In principle, we can learn the underlying true data generating process by the use of any valid spread divergence. In practice, however, the quality of the learned model can depend strongly on the choice of spread noise. We therefore investigated learning spread noise to maximally discriminate two distributions. We found the resulting training approach stable and that it can significantly improve the image generation results. Whilst state-of-the-art image generation is not the focus of this work, we obtained promising results. We also discussed the conditions under which spread MLE is consistent and asymptotically efficient, some of which are weaker than the equivalent MLE conditions. Perhaps the most appealing aspect of the spread noise is that it enables one to re-use standard machine learning approaches in statistics such as maximum likelihood to train models that would be otherwise unsuited to standard statistical training approaches.
