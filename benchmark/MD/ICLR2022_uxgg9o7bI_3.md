# ABSTRACT

We propose a new perspective on designing powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In a nutshell, this enables a general solution to inject structural properties of graphs into a message-passing aggregation scheme of GNNs. As a theoretical basis, we first develop a new hierarchy of local isomorphism on neighborhood subgraphs. Then, we generalise the message-passing aggregation scheme to theoretically characterize how GNNs can be designed to be more expressive beyond the Weisfeiler Lehman test. To elaborate this framework, we propose a novel neural model, called GraphSNN, and prove that this model is strictly more expressive than the Weisfeiler Lehman test in distinguishing graph structures. We empirically verify the strength of our model on different graph learning tasks. It is shown that our model consistently improves the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark tasks without sacrificing computational simplicity and efficiency.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) employ a message-passing aggregation scheme to learn low-dimensional vector space representations for nodes in a graph (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Velicković et al., 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017; Sato, 2020; Loukas, 2020; de Haan et al., 2020). Let  $G = (V, E)$  be a graph. For each node  $v \in V$ , a message-passing aggregation scheme recursively aggregates the feature vectors of nodes in the neighborhood of  $v$  and combines the aggregated information with the feature vector of  $v$  itself to obtain a representation. Since there is no natural ordering on nodes, such message-passing aggregation schemes are usually required to be permutation-invariant (Maron et al., 2018; Keriven & Peyré, 2019; Garg et al., 2020).

Despite advances of GNNs in various graph learning tasks such as node classification (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Xu et al., 2018), graph classification (Xu et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019) and link prediction (Zhang & Chen, 2017), there is still a lack of comprehensive theoretical understanding of how to design powerful and practically useful GNNs that can capture rich structural information of graphs. Recent studies (Xu et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2019) have explored the connections between GNNs and the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test (Weisfeiler & Leman, 1968). By representing a neighborhood as a multiset of feature vectors and treating the neighborhood aggregation as an aggregation function over multisets, Xu et al. (2019) showed that message-passing GNNs are at most as powerful as the WL test in distinguishing graph structures. However, many simple and practically important graph structures still cannot be distinguished by the WL test, e.g., the graphs  $G_{1}$  and  $G_{2}$  shown in Figure 1. A question bound to arise is: how to design expressive yet simple GNNs that can go beyond the WL test with a theoretically provable guarantee?

Recently, there have been three main directions of extending GNNs beyond WL: (1) building GNNs for higher-order WL (i.e.  $k$ -WL with  $k \geq 3$ ) or variants (Maron et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2020; 2019); (2) counting on pre-defined substructures as additional features (Bouritsas et al., 2020); (3) augmenting node identifiers or random features into GNNs (You et al., 2021; Vignac et al., 2020; Sato et al., 2021). Unlike these works, we aim to introduce a general but simple solution upon which GNNs can be enhanced to capture structural properties of graphs for dealing with different graph learning tasks. This solution enables GNNs to provably more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, but still computationally efficient. It overcomes the following limitations of existing works. Compared with higher-order WL methods in (1) which require high computational overheads and are impractical, our method goes beyond the WL test but is still computationally efficient. Compared with the methods

Figure 1: An overview of our proposed framework for GNNs that can go beyond the WL test in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs  $G_{1}$  and  $G_{2}$ . The overlap subgraphs of  $G_{1}$  and  $G_{2}$  are structurally different, which are captured by structural coefficients defined in Eq. 4.

on counting substructures in (2), our method does not require any domain knowledge to handcraft and choose substructures. Compared with the methods of augmenting node identifiers or random features in (3), our method can flexibly capture different classes of local structural information w.r.t. different graph learning tasks.

In a nutshell, our work is grounded in three observations: (i) Treating a neighborhood as a multiset of feature vectors ignores the rich structure information among vertices in the neighborhood, thereby limiting the representational capacity of a model. Thus, we represent a neighborhood as a neighborhood subgraph in which vertices are structurally related, and show that the WL test is only as powerful as distinguishing neighborhood subgraphs in terms of their subtree structures in the neighborhood. (ii) There exists a natural class of isomorphic graphs, strictly lying in between neighborhood subgraph isomorphism and neighborhood subtree isomorphism, which we call overlap subgraph isomorphism. The notion of overlap subgraph enables us to characterize structural interactions of vertices and inject them into a message-passing aggregation scheme for GNNs. (iii) By designing a proper function that satisfies certain properties to quantify structural interactions of vertices in a neighborhood and by preserving the injectiveness of a message-passing aggregation scheme, more expressive GNNs than the WL test can be developed. We propose a new GNN model that is strictly more expressive than the WL test to demonstrate an instance of this kind.

Contributions. In summary, the main contributions of this work are as follows:

- We introduce a new hierarchy of local isomorphism to characterise different classes of local structures in neighborhood subgraphs, and discuss its connections with the WL test and GNNs (Section 2 and Theorems 1-2).  
- We develop a simple yet powerful framework to inject structural properties into a message-passing aggregation scheme, and theoretically characterize how GNNs can be designed to be more expressive beyond the WL test (Section 3 and Theorem 3).  
- We propose a novel neural model for graph learning, called GraphSNN, and prove that GraphSNN is strictly more expressive than the WL test in distinguishing graph structures (Section 4 and Theorem 4).  
- We show that, due to the way of injecting structural properties into a structured-message-passing aggregation scheme, GraphSNN can overcome the oversmoothing issue (Chen et al., 2020a; Zhao & Akoglu, 2019; Li et al., 2018) (Section 5.4).

We have conducted experiments on benchmark tasks (Hu et al., 2020). The experimental results show that our model is highly efficient and can significantly improve the state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing computational simplicity.

Related work. Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy is a well-established framework for graph isomorphism tests (Grohe, 2017). Introduced by Weisfeiler and Leman (Weisfeiler & Leman, 1968), the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm (also called 1-WL or color refinement) is a computationally efficient

heuristic for testing graph isomorphism (Babai & Kucera, 1979). It is known that 1-WL and 2-WL have the same power in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs; when  $k \geq 3$ , k-WL is strictly more powerful than (k-1)-WL (Cai et al., 1992; Grohe, 2017).

Message-passing GNNs are typically considered as a differentiable neural generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms on graphs. It has been reported (Xu et al., 2019) that some popular GNNs such as GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017) and GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017) are at most powerful as 1-WL in distinguishing graph structures. Xu et al. (2019) has shown that Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) can be as powerful as 1-WL. At its core, GIN provides an injective aggregation scheme that is defined as a function over multisets of feature vectors, and thus GIN has the representational power to map any two different multisets of feature vectors to different representations in an embedding space.

A considerable amount of efforts has been devoted to improve the expressive power of GNNs beyond 1-WL. Generally, there are three directions: (1) Several works proposed higher-order variants of GNNs that are as powerful as k-WL with  $k \geq 3$  (Azizian et al., 2020). For example, Morris et al. (2019) introduced k-order graph networks that are expressive as a set-based variant of k-WL, Maron et al. (2019) proposed a simple GNN model and showed that it is as expressive as 3-WL, and Morris et al. (2020) proposed a local version of k-WL which considers only a subset of vertices in a neighborhood. However, these more expressive GNNs are impractical to use due to their inherent high computational costs and sophisticated design. (2) Some works attempted to incorporate inductive biases based on isomorphism counting on pre-defined topological features such as triangles, cliques, and rings (Bouritsas et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Monti et al., 2018), similar to the traditional ideas of graph kernels (Yanardag & Vishwanathan, 2015). However, pre-defining topological features requires domain-specific expertise, which is often not readily available. (3) Most recently, several works explored the ideas of augmenting GNNs using node identifiers or random features. For example, Vignac et al. (2020) proposed a method that maintains a "local context" for each node based on manipulating node identifiers in a permutation equivariant way. You et al. (2021) developed ID-GNNs by taking into account the identity information of vertices. Chen et al. (2020b) and Murphy et al. (2019) assigned one-hot IDs to vertices based on the ideas of relational pooling. Sato et al. (2021) added a random feature to each node to improve the representational capability of GNNs.

Our work is fundamentally different from existing models by injecting properties of structural interactions among vertices based on a natural class of isomorphic graphs in the local neighborhood (i.e., overlap subgraph isomorphism) into a message-passing aggregation scheme of GNNs.

# 2 A NEW HIERARCHY OF LOCAL ISOMORPHISM

In this section, we characterize a hierarchy of graph isomorphism based on local neighborhood subgraphs and explore its connections to 1-WL.

Let  $G = (V, E)$  be a simple, undirected graph with a set  $V$  of vertices and a set  $E$  of edges. The set of neighbors of a vertex  $v$  is denoted by  $\mathcal{N}(v) = \{u \in V | (v, u) \in E\}$ . The neighborhood subgraph of a vertex  $v$ , denoted by  $S_v$ , is the subgraph induced in  $G$  by  $\tilde{\mathcal{N}}(v) = \mathcal{N}(v) \cup \{v\}$ , which contains all edges in  $E$  that have both endpoints in  $\tilde{\mathcal{N}}(v)$ . For two adjacent vertices  $v$  and  $u$ , i.e.,  $(v, u) \in E$ , the overlap subgraph  $S_{vu}$  between  $v$  and  $u$  is defined as  $S_{vu} = S_v \cap S_u$ .

Let  $S_{i}$  and  $S_{j}$  be the neighborhood subgraphs of two vertices  $i$  and  $j$  that are not necessarily adjacent, and  $h_v$  be the feature vector of a vertex  $v \in V$ . In the following, we define three notions of isomorphism, which correspond to different classes of local structures in neighborhood subgraphs.

Definition 1.  $S_{i}$  and  $S_{j}$  are subgraph-isomorphic, denoted as  $S_{i} \simeq_{subgraph} S_{j}$ , if there exists a bijective mapping  $g: \tilde{\mathcal{N}}(i) \to \tilde{\mathcal{N}}(j)$  such that  $g(i) = j$  and for any two vertices  $v_{1}, v_{2} \in \tilde{\mathcal{N}}(i)$ ,  $v_{1}$  and  $v_{2}$  are adjacent in  $S_{i}$  iff  $g(v_{1})$  and  $g(v_{2})$  are adjacent in  $S_{j}$ , and  $h_{v_{1}} = h_{g(v_{1})}$  and  $h_{v_{2}} = h_{g(v_{2})}$ .

Definition 2.  $S_{i}$  and  $S_{j}$  are overlap-isomorphic, denoted as  $S_{i} \simeq_{\text{overlap}} S_{j}$ , if there exists a bijective mapping  $g: \tilde{\mathcal{N}}(i) \to \tilde{\mathcal{N}}(j)$  such that  $g(i) = j$  and for any  $v' \in \mathcal{N}(i)$  and  $g(v') = u'$ ,  $S_{iv'}$  and  $S_{ju'}$  are subgraph-isomorphic.

Definition 3.  $S_{i}$  and  $S_{j}$  are subtree-isomorphic, denoted as  $S_{i} \simeq_{\text{subtree}} S_{j}$ , if there exists a bijective mapping  $g: \tilde{\mathcal{N}}(i) \to \tilde{\mathcal{N}}(j)$  such that  $g(i) = j$  and for any  $v' \in \tilde{\mathcal{N}}(i)$  and  $g(v') = u'$ ,  $h_{v'} = h_{u'}$ .

Figure 2: (a)  $S_{i}$  and  $S_{j}$  are overlap-isomorphic but not subgraph-isomorphic; (b) Four neighborhood subgraphs  $\{S_{v_i}|i = 1,2,3,4\}$  are subtree-isomorphic but not overlap-isomorphic.

Theorem 1 states that there is a hierarchy among these notions of local isomorphism on neighborhood subgraphs, where subgraph-isomorphism is the strongest one, subtree-isomorphism is the weakest, and overlap-isomorphism lies in between. Figure 2 shows two groups of graphs: one is distinguishable w.r.t. subgraph-isomorphism but not overlap-isomorphism, while the other is distinguishable by overlap-isomorphism but not subtree-isomorphism.

Theorem 1. The following statements are true: (a) If  $S_{i} \simeq_{\text{subgraph}} S_{j}$ , then  $S_{i} \simeq_{\text{overlap}} S_{j}$ ; but not vice versa; (b) If  $S_{i} \simeq_{\text{overlap}} S_{j}$ , then  $S_{i} \simeq_{\text{subtree}} S_{j}$ ; but not vice versa.

Let  $\mathcal{S} = \{S_v | v \in V\}$  and  $\zeta : S \to \mathbb{R}^d$  mapping each neighborhood subgraph in  $\mathcal{S}$  into a node embedding in  $\mathbb{R}^d$ . The following theorem states that GNNs that are as powerful as 1-WL can distinguish two neighborhood subgraphs only w.r.t. subtree-isomorphism at each layer.

Theorem 2. Let  $M$  be a GNN.  $M$  is as powerful as 1-WL in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs if  $M$  has a sufficient number of layers and each layer can map any  $S_{i}$  and  $S_{j}$  in  $S$  into two different embeddings (i.e.,  $\zeta(S_{i}) \neq \zeta(S_{j})$ ) if and only if  $S_{i} \not\cong_{\text{subtree}} S_{j}$ .

The complete proofs of these theorems are provided in Appendix C.

# 3 A GENERALISEDMESSAGE-PASSING FRAMEWORK

In this section, we present a generalised message-passing framework (GMP) which enables to inject local structure into an aggregation scheme, in light of overlap subgraphs. We theoretically characterize how GNNs can be designed to be more expressive than 1-WL in this framework.

Let  $S^{*} = \{S_{vu}|(v,u)\in E\}$  be the set of overlap subgraphs in  $G$ . We define structural coefficients for each vertex  $v$  and its neighbors, i.e.,  $\omega :S\times S^{*}\to \mathbb{R}$  such that  $A_{vu} = \omega (S_v,S_{vu})$ . A question arising is: what are the desirable properties of such a function  $\omega$ ? Ideally, it should quantify how a vertex  $v$  structurally interacts with its neighbor  $u$  in the local neighborhood. Thus, given  $S_{vu} = (V_{vu},E_{vu})$  and  $S_{vu^{\prime}} = (V_{vu^{\prime}},E_{vu^{\prime}})$ , a carefully designed  $\omega$  should exhibit the following properties:

(1) Local closeness:  $\omega(S_v, S_{vu}) > \omega(S_v, S_{vu'})$  if  $S_{vu}$  and  $S_{vu'}$  are complete graphs with  $S_{vu} = K_i$ ,  $S_{vu'} = K_j$ , and  $i > j$ , where  $K_i$  refers to a complete graph on  $i$  vertices.  
(2) Local denseness:  $\omega(S_v, S_{vu}) > \omega(S_v, S_{vu'})$  if  $S_{vu}$  and  $S_{vu'}$  have the same number of vertices but differ in the number of edges s.t.  $|V_{vu}| = |V_{vu'}|$  and  $|E_{vu}| > |E_{vu'}|$ .  
(3) Isomorphic invariant:  $\omega(S_v, S_{vu}) = \omega(S_v, S_{vu'})$  if  $S_{vu}$  and  $S_{vu'}$  are isomorphic.

Figure 3 illustrates the first two properties. Let  $\{\cdot\}$  denote a multiset,  $\tilde{A} = (\tilde{A}_{vu})_{v,u\in V}$  where  $\tilde{A}_{vu}$  is a normalised value of  $A_{vu}$ , and  $X\in \mathbb{R}^{|V|\times f}$  be a matrix of input feature vectors where  $x_{v}\in \mathbb{R}^{f}$  associates each  $v\in V$ . We denote the feature vector of  $v$  at the t-th layer by  $h_v^{(t)}$  and  $h_v^{(0)} = x_v$ . Then, the  $(t + 1)$ -th layer of an aggregation scheme can be defined as:

$$
m _ {a} ^ {(t)} = \operatorname {A G G R E G A T E} ^ {N} \left(\left\{\left(\left(\tilde {A} _ {v u}, h _ {u} ^ {(t)}\right) \mid u \in \mathcal {N} (v) \right\} \right\}\right), \tag {1}
$$

$$
m _ {v} ^ {(t)} = \operatorname {A G G R E G A T E} ^ {I} \left(\{\{\tilde {A} _ {v u} | u \in \mathcal {N} (v) \} \}\right) h _ {v} ^ {(t)}, \tag {2}
$$

$$
h _ {v} ^ {(t + 1)} = \operatorname {C o m b i n e} \left(m _ {v} ^ {(t)}, m _ {a} ^ {(t)}\right). \tag {3}
$$

Figure 3: (a) Local closeness: for overlap subgraphs that are complete graphs, their structural coefficients increase with the number of vertices; (b) Local denseness: for overlap subgraphs that have the same number of vertices, their structural coefficients increase with the number of edges.

$\mathrm{AGGREGATE}^N (\cdot)$  and  $\mathrm{AGGREGATE}^I (\cdot)$  are two possibly different parameterized functions. Here,  $m_{a}^{(t)}$  is a message aggregated from the neighbors of  $v$  and their structural coefficients, and  $m_v^{(t)}$  is an "adjusted" message from  $v$  after performing an element-wise multiplication between  $\mathrm{AGGREGATE}^I (\cdot)$  and  $h_v^{(t)}$  to account for structural effects from its neighbors. Then,  $m_v^{(t)}$  and  $m_a^{(t)}$  are combined by  $\mathrm{COMBINE}(\cdot)$  to obtain the feature vector  $h_v^{(t + 1)}$ .

The following theorem states that a GNN can be more expressive than 1-WL if  $\omega$  is powerful enough to distinguish structure beyond neighborhood subtrees and the neighborhood aggregation function  $\Phi$  is injective under a sufficient number of layers. The proof is provided in Appendix C.

Theorem 3. Let  $M$  be a GNN whose aggregation scheme  $\Phi$  is defined by Eq. 1-Eq. 3.  $M$  is strictly more expressive than 1-WL in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs if  $M$  has a sufficient number of layers and also satisfies the following conditions:

(1)  $M$  can distinguish at least two neighborhood subgraphs  $S_{i}$  and  $S_{j}$  with  $S_{i} \simeq_{\text{subtree}} S_{j}$ ,  $S_{i} \not\simeq_{\text{subgraph}} S_{j}$  and  $\{\{\tilde{A}_{iv'}|v' \in \mathcal{N}(i)\}\} \neq \{\{\tilde{A}_{ju'}|u' \in \mathcal{N}(j)\}\}$ ;  
(2)  $\Phi\left(h_v^{(t)}, \{\{h_u^{(t)}|u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}\}, \{\{(\tilde{A}_{vu}, h_u^{(t)})|u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\}\}\right)$  is injective.

# 4 GRAPHSNN

Generally, there are many different ways of designing  $\omega$  and  $\Phi$  functions, leading to GNNs with different expressive powers. To elaborate this, we propose a novel GNN model, named GraphSNN, whose aggregation scheme is an instantiation of our generalised message-passing framework. We prove that the expressive power of GraphSNN goes beyond 1-WL.

Model design. Following the properties of  $\omega$  (i.e., local closeness, local denseness, and isomorphic invariant), we may instantiate  $\omega$  as follows to define  $A_{vu}$  for GraphSNN, where  $\lambda > 0$ :

$$
\omega \left(S _ {v}, S _ {v u}\right) = \frac {\left| E _ {v u} \right|}{\left| V _ {v u} \right| \cdot \left| V _ {v u} - 1 \right|} \left| V _ {v u} \right| ^ {\lambda}. \tag {4}
$$

Then, we formulate a weighted adjacency matrix  $A = (A_{vu})_{v,u\in V}$ . To make structural coefficients easily comparable across different nodes, we normalize  $A$  to  $\tilde{A}$  by  $\tilde{A}_{vu} = \frac{A_{vu}}{\sum_{u\in\mathcal{N}(v)}A_{vu}}$ . Alternatively,  $A$  can be normalized using Softmax or other normalization techniques. For each vertex  $v\in V$ , the feature vector at the  $(t + 1)$ -th layer is generated by

$$
h _ {v} ^ {(t + 1)} = \mathrm {M L P} _ {\theta} \left(\gamma^ {(t)} \left(\sum_ {u \in \mathcal {N} (v)} \tilde {A} _ {v u} + 1\right) h _ {v} ^ {(t)} + \sum_ {u \in \mathcal {N} (v)} \left(\tilde {A} _ {v u} + 1\right) h _ {u} ^ {(t)}\right), \tag {5}
$$

where  $\gamma^{(t)}$  is a learnable scalar parameter. Since  $\mathcal{N}(v)$  refers to one-hop neighbors of  $v$ , one can stack multiple layers to handle more than one-hop neighborhood. Note that, to ensure the injectivity in the feature aggregation in the presence of structural coefficients, we add 1 into the first and second terms in Eq. 5. This design is critical for guaranteeing the expressiveness of GraphSNN beyond 1-WL, as will be discussed in the proofs of the lemmas and Theorem 4 later.

Expressiveness analysis. We first generalise the result of universal functions over multisetts (Xu et al., 2019) to universal functions over pairs of multisetts since Eq. 5 involves not only node features but

also structural coefficients. Assume that  $\mathcal{H}$ ,  $\mathcal{A}$  and  $\mathcal{W}$  are countable sets where  $\mathcal{H}$  is a node feature space,  $\mathcal{A}$  is a structural coefficient space, and  $\mathcal{W} = \{A_{ij}h_i|A_{ij}\in \mathcal{A},h_i\in \mathcal{H}\}$ . Let  $H$  and  $W$  be two multisets containing elements from  $\mathcal{H}$  and  $\mathcal{W}$ , respectively, and  $|H| = |W|$ . We can prove Lemma 1, Lemma 2 and Theorem 4 below, where the proof details are provided in Appendix C.

Lemma 1. There exists a function  $f$  s.t.  $\pi(H, W) = \sum_{h \in H, w \in W} f(h, w)$  is unique for any distinct pair of multisets  $(H, W)$ .

Then, the injectiveness of  $\pi (H,W)$  can be extended to  $\pi^{\prime}(a,H,W)$  as in the lemma below.

Lemma 2. There exists a function  $f$  s.t.  $\pi^{\prime}(h_v,H,W) = \gamma f(h_v,|H|h_v) + \sum_{h\in H,w\in W}f(h,w)$  is unique for any distinct  $(h_v,H,W)$ , where  $h_v\in \mathcal{H}$ ,  $|H|h_v\in \mathcal{W}$ , and  $\gamma$  can be an irrational number.

Since any function over  $(h_v, H, W)$  can be decomposed as  $g(\gamma f(h_v, |H| h_v) + \sum_{h \in H, w \in W} f(h, w))$ , similar to Xu et al. (2019), we use a parameterized multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn  $f$  and  $g$ . The following theorem characterizes the expressive power of GraphSNN.

Theorem 4. GraphSNN is more expressive than 1-WL in testing non-isomorphic graphs.

Since GIN is as powerful as 1-WL (Xu et al., 2019), this theorem implies that GraphSNN is more expressive than GIN, i.e., GraphSNN can map at least two different neighborhood subgraphs that correspond to the same multiset of feature vectors to different representations.

Complexity analysis. Similar to GCN and GIN, GraphSNN is computationally efficient. The time complexity and memory complexity are linear w.r.t. the number of edges in a graph. Further, due to the locality of GraphSNN, the computation of aggregating feature vectors from neighborhood subgraphs at each layer can be parallelized across all vertices. Structural coefficients can be precomputed with the time complexity  $O(ml)$ , where  $m$  is the number of edges and  $l$  is the maximum degree of vertices in a graph, and this computation can also be parallelized across all edges. Table 9 in Appendix A summarizes the time and space complexities of several popular message-passing GNNs in comparison with GraphSNN.

# 5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we evaluate our models on node classification and graph classification benchmark tasks. All the results of our models are statistically significant at 0.05 level of significance.

# 5.1 NODE CLASSIFICATION

Datasets. We use five datasets: three citation network datasets Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed (Sen et al., 2008) for semi-supervised document classification, one knowledge graph dataset NELL (Carlson et al., 2010) for semi-supervised entity classification, and one OGB dataset ogbn-arxiv from (Hu et al., 2020). Table 10 in Appendix B contains statistics for these datasets.

**Baseline methods.** We consider the popular message-passing GNNs: GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GAT (Veličković et al., 2017), GIN (Xu et al., 2019), and GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017). For each of these baselines, we construct a  $\mathrm{GraphSNN}_M$  model by replacing its aggregation scheme by our aggregation scheme, which is detailed in Appendix A.

how effectively our aggregation scheme with structural coefficients can learn representations for vertices, compared with the standard message-passing aggregation scheme.

Experimental setup. We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) and  $\lambda = 1$ . For ogbn- arxiv, our models are trained for 500 epochs with the learning rate 0.01, dropout 0.5, hidden units 256, and  $\gamma = 0.1$ . For the other datasets, we use 200 epochs with the learning rate 0.001, and choose the best values for weight decay from  $\{0.001,0.002,\dots,0.009\}$  and hidden units from  $\{64,128,256,512\}$ . For  $\gamma$  and dropout at each layer, the best value for each model in each dataset is selected from  $\{0.1,0.2,\dots,0.6\}$ . GraphSNN  $G_{AT}$  uses the attention dropout 0.6 and 8 multi-attention heads. GraphSNN  $G_{GraphSAGE}$  uses the neighborhood sample size 25 with the mean aggregation.

We consider two settings of data splits for all datasets except for ogbn-arxiv: (1) the standard splits in Kipf & Welling (2017), i.e., 20 nodes from each class for training, 500 nodes for validation and 1000 nodes for testing, for which the results are presented in Table 1; (2) the random splits in Pei et al. (2020), i.e., randomly splitting nodes into  $60\%$ ,  $20\%$  and  $20\%$  for training, validation and testing, respectively, for which the results are presented in Table 13 in Appendix B. For ogbn-arxiv, we follow Hu et al. (2020) to use a time-based data split based on publication dates.

# 5.2 GRAPH CLASSIFICATION

We evaluate GraphSNN from three aspects: (1) small standard graph datasets, (2) large graph datasets and (3) comparison with GNNs that are go beyond 1-WL.

Experiments on small graphs. We use eight datasets from two categories: (1) bioinformatics datasets: MUTAG, PTC-MR, COX2, BZR, PROTEINS, and D&D (Debnath et al., 1991; Kriege et al., 2016; Wale et al., 2008; Shervashidze et al., 2011; Sutherland et al., 2003; Borgwardt & Kriegel, 2005); (2) social network datasets: IMDB-B and RDT-M5K (Yanardag & Vishwanathan, 2015). Table 11 in Appendix B contains statistics for these small graph datasets.

We compare against 12 baselines: (1) Graph kernel based methods: WL subtree kernel (Shervashidze et al., 2011), RetGK (Zhang et al., 2018b), GNTK (Du et al., 2019), P-WL (Rieck et al., 2019), WL-PM (Nikolentzos et al., 2017), WWL (Togninalli et al., 2019) and FGW (Titouan et al., 2019); (2) GNN based methods: PATCHY-SAN (Niepert et al., 2016), DGCNN (Zhang et al., 2018a), CapsGNN (Xinyi & Chen, 2018), GIN (Xu et al., 2019), and GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017).

Both the standard stratified splits (Xu et al., 2019) and the random splits are considered. We use 10-fold cross validation with  $90\%$  training and  $10\%$  testing, and report the best mean accuracy. For both settings, we use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015), batch size 64, hidden dimension 64, weight decay of 0.009, a 2-layer MLP with batch normalization, 500 epochs and dropout of 0.6, and  $\gamma = 0.1$  over all datasets. The readout function as in (Xu et al., 2019) is used which concatenates representations of all layers to obtain a final graph representation. For the standard stratified splits, we use the learning rate 0.009 over all datasets. For the random splits, we use the learning rate 0.008 for MUTAG and RDT-M5K, and 0.007 for the other datasets. Table 2 presents the results.

Table 3: Classification accuracy (\%) averaged over 10 runs on graph classification, where  $\lambda = 2$ . The results of the baselines are taken from (Hu et al., 2020) and the leaderboard of the OGB website. GraphSNN+VN achieves the best performance over all datasets.

Experiments on large graphs. We use five large graph datasets from Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) Hu et al. (2020), including four molecular graph datasets (ogbg-molhiv, ogbg-moltox21, ogbg-moltoxcast and ogb-molpcba) and one protein-protein association network (ogbg-ppa). Table 12 in Appendix B contains statistics for these large graph datasets.

We compare against the following methods that have reported the results on the above OGB datasets: GIN and  $\mathrm{GIN + VN}$  (Hu et al., 2020), GSN (Bouritsas et al., 2020), PNA (Corso et al., 2020), ID-GNNs (You et al., 2021) and Deep LRP (Chen et al., 2020b). In addition to the original model of GraphSNN, we also consider a variant, denoted as GraphSNN+VN, which performs the message passing over augmented graphs with virtual nodes in GraphSNN (Hu et al., 2020; Ishiguro et al., 2019).

We follow the same experiment setup as in Hu et al. (2020). We use the Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001, batch size 32, dropout 0.5 and 100 epochs for all datasets. GraphSNN uses a 8-layer MLP with embedding dimension 512 for ogbg-moltoxcast and ogbg-moltox21, while GraphSNN+VN has the embedding dimensions 300 and 256, and 8-layer and 5-layer MLPs for ogbg-moltoxcast and ogbg-moltox21, respectively. For ogbg-molhiv, ogbg-molpcba and ogbg-ppa, both GraphSNN and GraphSNN+VN use a 5-layer MLP and embedding dimension 200. Table 3 shows the results for the classification accuracy. Table 15 in Appendix B shows the results for the running time of the preprocessing step.

Comparison with GNNs beyond 1-WL. We compare GraphSNN with the other GNNs that are more expressive than 1-WL, including: GSN (Bouritsas et al., 2020), ID-GNNs (You et al., 2021) and k-WL GNN (Morris et al., 2019). We use the same experimental setup as in (Xu et al., 2019; Bouritsas et al., 2020; Maron et al., 2019). Table 4 shows the results.

# 5.3 ABLATION STUDY

We perform an ablation study to analyze the effect of  $\lambda$  values on model performance. Tables 5 and 6 show that  $\lambda = 1$  yields the highest performance for node classification, while  $\lambda = 2$  is the best for graph classification. This reflects a critical point - different classes of structure information are needed by different graph learning tasks.  $\lambda = 1$  captures local density, e.g., two overlap subgraphs may

considerably vary in the number of vertices but their local density can be very close. Our experiments show that injecting such local density helps improve the performance of node classification.  $\lambda = 2$  captures local similarity, i.e., how similar two overlap subgraphs are. Two overlap subgraphs that considerably differ in the number of vertices would have very different structural coefficients. Since graph classification requires to compare the similarity of two graphs,  $\lambda = 2$  is thus the best.

# 5.4 OVERSMOOTHING ANALYSIS

We analyse the impact of model depth (number of layers) on node classification performance. In addition to GCN and  $\mathrm{GraphSNN}_{GCN}$ , we also compare these models with a residual connection (i.e., GCN+residual and  $\mathrm{GraphSNN}_{GCN}+$ residual). We evaluate all the models on cora dataset on the standard splits and the same hyperparameters as in Section 5.1. Table 7 shows the results in terms of classification accuracy averaged over 10 runs. When increasing the model depth,  $\mathrm{GraphSNN}_{GCN}$  performs consistently better than GCN at each layer. Further, GraphSNN helps alleviate the oversmoothing issue even in the presence of residual connections. Further results of the oversmoothing analysis are provided in Appendix B.

# 6 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have introduced a GNN framework, which enables a general way of injecting structural information into a message-passing aggregation scheme. We have also introduced a novel GNN model, GraphSNN, for graph learning, and prove that GraphSNN is more expressive than 1-WL in distinguishing graph structures. It is shown that GraphSNN consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art approaches in both node classification and graph classification benchmark tasks.
